Describing a “leadership style” that is “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective,” the official cited “early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment” that were dropped because “no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis.” Instead, he said, cooler heads are seeking “to steer the administration in the right direction until—one way or another—it’s over.”\n\nControversy has focused mostly on whether this official should be praised for curbing Trump or blasted for writing anonymously. But there’s another question that’s trickier: Can the 25th Amendment be used to send Trump back to Manhattan? Ratified in 1967, the amendment has four sections. Section 1 restated more or less what’s in the Constitution: that if the president is removed from office because of death or resignation, the vice president becomes president. Section 2 allows for the replacement of the vice president when the office is vacant; it was used to make Gerald Ford vice president after Spiro Agnew’s resignation in 1973, and to install Nelson Rockefeller after Ford’s ascension to the presidency. Section 3 sets forth when and how the president can voluntarily transfer his powers temporarily—as, for example, George W. Bush did twice when undergoing colonoscopies. But this debate centers on Section 4, which has never been invoked. This section lets the vice president and a majority of Cabinet secretaries (“or such body as Congress may by law provide”) declare the president “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” making the vice president the “Acting President” until the president, through a complex process, is deemed fit to return to office.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCan Trump be removed from office under this amendment? Or would doing so provoke a constitutional crisis, as the Times’ essayist feared? Some critics have attacked the official for not going forward with Section 4, suggesting that the internal undermining of Trump is dangerous or undemocratic. The history of the 25th Amendment, however, suggests that our unnamed informer is on solid ground.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe concern with presidential inability dates at least to the 1880s, when an assassin shot President James Garfield, who lay dying for 79 days. During that long stretch, Garfield was largely unable to carry out any presidential duties, but these were summer months, the presidency was a less substantial office, and, while some matters went neglected, no urgent need for his leadership arose. Still, Vice President Chester Arthur and others debated how to proceed, and Arthur did not want to look like a usurper. The original text of the Constitution says that in case of presidential inability, the powers and duties of the office devolve on the vice president—but it doesn’t say what constitutes inability or how it is determined. In his December 1881 message to Congress, Arthur, now president, noted many unresolved questions: “What is the intendment of the Constitution in its specification of ‘inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office’ as one of the contingencies which calls the Vice-President to the exercise of Presidential functions? Is the inability limited in its nature to long-continued intellectual incapacity, or has it a broader import? What must be its extent and duration? How must its existence be established?” He called on Congress to take up these and other related questions.\n\nBy the time of Woodrow Wilson’s presidency, however, the answers remained murky. And when Wilson suffered a major stroke in 1919, there was renewed discussion of legislation to clarify these questions. But the Republican-led Congress took no action to remove Wilson, even temporarily, fearing Democratic reprisals and voter backlash. Wilson himself showed no inclination to resign. In the event, his wife, Edith, nicknamed the “Presidentress,” and Wilson’s doctor and friend, Dr. Cary T. Grayson—neither of whom were elected officials—ended up making many decisions in his name.\n\nEfforts to resolve the issue took on new urgency in the nuclear age, when the danger of a mentally unfit or incapacitated president starting a war assumed apocalyptic dimensions. Dwight Eisenhower suffered several health crises, including a heart attack in 1955, a bout of crippling ileitis in 1956, and a stroke in 1957. His precarious health, and the ugly reputation of his vice president, Richard Nixon, prompted Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1956, to warn voters about putting Nixon one heartbeat away from nuclear control. In March 1958, after winning reelection, Eisenhower and Nixon signed an agreement providing that in the event of presidential inability, the president would inform the vice president (if possible) and the vice president would serve as acting president, exercising the powers and duties of the office. The president himself would decide when he was no longer inabled—notably, legislators used that word and not “disabled,” which can imply a surmountable handicap—and reassume the powers and duties of the office. John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson signed a similar agreement in 1961.\n\nKennedy’s assassination in 1963, along with the continuing specter of nuclear war, finally spurred the ratification of an amendment to resolve the confusion. Although Kennedy died quickly, people wondered what would have happened if he had lingered comatose in Parkland Hospital. “Has the Congress prepared the presidency adequately for the possibilities of a violent age?” New York Times columnist James Reston asked. “Is the rule of presidential succession satisfactory for these days of human madness and scientific destruction?”\n\n\n\n***\n\nSenator Birch Bayh of Indiana led the charge for a remedy. Drawing on the work of a young member of the American Bar Association, John D. Feerick, Bayh argued that Congress had to solve the questions around entitled inability—how it is defined, who initiates the question of whether it has occurred, who resolves the issue when it has been raised, and who decides if and when the inability has ended. Bayh drafted an amendment that made its way through Congress. Senate Minority Leader Everett M. Dirksen emerged as a key opponent; though he also favored an amendment, he wanted the broadest language possible that would empower Congress to determine presidential inability—a “blank check,” in Bayh’s view. In contrast, Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York wanted the amendment to define “inability” more closely, with more precision about the “gravity” and “duration” of the incapacity that would warrant action. Short of that, he wished for examples of what did not count as an inability.\n\nDuring hearings in 1964 and 1965, members of Congress debated what constituted “inability” in Sections 3 and 4. Some, such as Representative Richard Poff of Virginia, suggested that Section 4 should be used when the president was simply “unable or unwilling to make any rational decision.” But the burden of the congressional commentary was to conclude, as Feerick wrote, that “unpopularity, incompetence, impeachable conduct, poor judgment, and laziness [did] not constitute an ‘inability’ within the meanings of the amendment.”\n\nSo what did count? In a 1992 book, The President Has Been Shot, physician Herbert L. Abrams examined the situations in which the amendment’s framers intended for Sections 3 and 4 to be invoked. Section 3—the temporary transfer of power—applied, in his judgment, during “planned, major surgery,” other surgery requiring general anesthesia, and “the use of psychoactive drugs in significant amounts.” It could also be invoked, he said, in the event of “serious presidential illness”; “the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or of any other progressive, mentally disabling conditions”; if the president or his physician believed “that an illness, injury, or emotional condition is interfering with his judgment or ability to govern”; or during “any anticipated situations in which the president will be unable to communicate with his government,” such as a nuclear strike.\n\nAs for Section 4, Abrams said its use was more “complicated and delicate.” It applied during such serious situations as “loss of consciousness,” “significant alterations of the president’s cognitive faculties or inability to communicate,” “serious injury to the president following an accident or attack on his person,” “terminal illness,” and “progressive, mentally disabling conditions.”\n\nThe legislative debate over the amendment and the prevailing interpretations of its meanings suggest that, despite its vagueness, it doesn’t apply to someone like Trump. Trump has an extreme personality, with many negative qualities—as the Times' op-ed writer notes, he is “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.” Some might judge him to be a grandiose narcissist or even a pathological liar. But having a personality disorder or even certain forms of mental illness doesn’t necessarily render a president unfit to govern (Lincoln suffered from depression). And in fact, Trump is not “unable” to serve as president, as would be required to invoke the 25th Amendment. He is actually a high-achieving, high-functioning person who has excelled in business, entertainment and now politics. He hasn’t suffered from a crippling stroke, a psychotic break or dementia. He is, we would argue, temperamentally unsuited to be president—but that is a reason to vote against him, not to resort to a never-used clause in a constitutional amendment. If Cabinet officers tried to use Section 4, Trump would surely challenge them in court and in the court of public opinion—setting up a constitutional crisis that would make the Clinton impeachment and Bush v. Gore look like schoolyard spats. Trump might conceivably refuse to leave office even if ordered by the Supreme Court—at which point Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ loyalties would really be tested.\n\nSo what can be done to rein in Trump’s “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective” style? According to the Constitution, impeachment is supposed to be used only for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” Even if Trump has committed such crimes, convicting him would require the votes of 17 Republican senators—which aren’t likely to be forthcoming soon. For those who worry about Trump’s governance, the answer is to vote him out when he’s up for reelection, in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the best hope for the nation is for senior officials in the administration who are less impulsive and more reasonable than Trump to mitigate his worst inclinations—precisely what the anonymous White House official says some are attempting to do. Doing so is fully constitutional and far from unprecedented: Nixon’s aides often defied orders he made while drunk or in an emotional froth, and Reagan’s advisers famously sought to quietly set things right when his inattention or rhetorical recklessness caused trouble, as often happened. The Trump officials who are using their duly constituted power to try to avert disaster may or may not be “unsung heroes,” but surely it is better than the alternative—of trying to exploit a clause in the Constitution to cashier a president through nonelective means.\n\nDavid Greenberg, a professor of history and journalism and media studies at Rutgers, is a contributing editor at Politico Magazine.

Daniels' lawyer sees bid to shield Trump from a deposition.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's disgraced former personal lawyer Michael Cohen is trying to rescind the $130,000 hush money deal he struck with porn star Stormy Daniels to tamp down reports about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, but a lawyer for Daniels says the move seems to be aimed at preventing full disclosure about Trump's role in the agreement.\n\nCohen submitted a filing to a federal court in Los Angeles on Friday renouncing the contract and promising he will take no action to enforce it, although he said he might still try to recover the $130,000 Daniels received under the pact struck just days before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe move came less than three weeks after Cohen appeared before a federal judge in Manhattan and admitted his guilt on eight felony charges, including one that said the payment to Daniels violated federal campaign finance law because it was intended to aid Trump's presidential bid.\n\nCohen's latest action effectively concedes part of a lawsuit Daniels — whose real name is Stephanie Clifford — filed against Cohen and Trump in March seeking to void the contract. In a supplemental statement filed Saturday, lawyers for Trump said they would not seek to enforce any settlement and will accept Daniels’ claim that the contract was void or unenforceable. They also continued to insist that Trump was not himself party to it.\n\nHowever, Daniels' outspoken attorney Michael Avenatti said Friday that he views the legal tactic as a way of obscuring the truth.\n\n\"Michael Cohen is back to playing games and trying to protect Donald Trump. He is now pulling a legal stunt to try and 'fix it' so that we can’t depose Trump and present evidence to the American people about what happened,\" Avenatti wrote on Twitter. \"He is not a hero nor a patriot. He deserves what he gets.\n\n\"The “offer” is DOA. We have been anticipating this for months…..Let me be clear - my client and I will never settle the cases absent full disclosure and accountability.

It was also something of a dead letter, since Daniels appeared on \"60 Minutes\" in March and detailed the alleged sexual dalliance.\n\nThe move by Cohen's lawyers Friday does not appear to affect a part of the lawsuit accusing Cohen of defamation over a statement he made earlier this year allegedly suggesting Daniels was lying about her interactions with Trump.\n\nAttorneys for Cohen and Trump had moved to force the case into arbitration, but the judge froze all action in the case while the criminal investigation against Cohen unfolded.\n\nLast month, prior to Cohen's plea, the judge extended the stay through mid-September. A scheduling hearing on the suit is currently set for September 24.\n\nA lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a message Friday seeking comment on the latest developments.", "clickbait": null}

But people working on those matters said Thursday that the Times piece only amps up the president’s paranoia by handing him proof that members of his own team are working against him, according to interviews with more than a dozen Republicans, including nine senators.\n\n“It kind of reinforces his message out there that there’s a bunch of folks here embedded in the Washington bureaucracy that are out to get him. I’m not sure it accomplishes what the folks behind it think it does,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of GOP leadership.\n\nNow the president is likely to view any disagreement from advisers with suspicion.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n“What this person did is badly hurt the effort to rein in Trump ... and it will make him crazy,” said a Republican close to the White House. “Now, if you say to the president, ‘I see where you’re heading, but I’m not sure about that’ — he’s going to think, ‘Ah, you wrote that.’”\n\nEven some of Trump’s most public critics said they didn’t understand the value of the op-ed, other than to state publicly what’s been discussed privately among Washington Republicans since Trump was elected nearly two years ago.\n\n“I’m not a fan of people doing things in an anonymous way. If you’ve got something to say, look the camera in the eye and say it. Talk to people directly. When I read it, to me there was nothing new,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a frequent Trump critic. “Any of us who have dealt with the White House understand the situation that’s there.”\n\n“There are lots of really, really good people around the president who are trying to restrain his impulsiveness,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told talk radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday morning. “I don’t understand the morality of why anyone would write the piece, because it seems pretty obvious to me that what it’s going to do is foster more paranoia.”\n\nA handful of Republicans including Corker, Sasse and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) often air their complaints about Trump publicly. But the vast majority of GOP lawmakers carp about the president’s erratic behavior in private, while quietly working on legislation that in some cases contradicts the president’s positions.\n\nThe anonymous op-ed argued that the president resisted diplomatic efforts to push back on Russian aggression — including a move to expel Russian spies in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Great Britain — before giving in to senior advisers. GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill have done much the same, helping to force the imposition of additional sanctions on Russia in July of last year over White House objections, but without labeling themselves part of the resistance.\n\nFlake said he’s much more impressed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions fortitude in refusing to quit in the face of constant barbs and insults from Trump than he was by an administration aide calling out Trump under the cloak of anonymity.\n\n“What’s more remarkable is what’s going on out in the open: Jeff Sessions. You have the president instructing him to reward his friends and punish his enemies and Jeff is saying no,” the retiring Arizona senator said. “That’s the preferred model. And I hope he keeps it up.”\n\nBut such episodes have been rare since the presidential campaign, when dozens of Republican foreign policy experts signed letters declaring their opposition to Trump on the grounds that he was, in their view, unfit for office.\n\n“Most fundamentally, Mr. Trump lacks the character, values, experience to be president,” one of the letters stated. Many Republicans didn’t sign the letters: domestic policy wonks and elected officials were not invited to do so. But it nonetheless captured the consensus view of most Republicans both during the campaign and since Trump entered the White House.\n\nWhile the letter signers outed themselves publicly and were blacklisted by the new administration, hundreds of policy experts who shared their views but did not publicly denounce the president during the campaign joined the new administration. The result, to a larger extent than ever before, is a government filled with hundreds of political appointees — tapped for their ostensible loyalty to the administration — who nonetheless have a dim view of the president.\n\nThough they disagree with the publication of an op-ed laying out the quiet resistance to Trump, many Republicans have tried their own tactics at moderating the president. Top party leaders have tried, repeatedly, to tell the president to stop making off-the-cuff remarks and tweets. Among his latest missives, Trump raised the prospect of “treason” and demanded that the Times turn over the name of the anonymous official in the name of national security.\n\n“A number of us have given the president some friendly advice, like on the Twitter account and the like. But he’s convinced that helped him get elected president,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). “We’ve tried to give him advice in that area. And he rejected it.”\n\nCornyn was with Trump and other top leaders when the Times op-ed came out. At the time, the president was discussing revelations in Bob Woodward’s new book and praising his staff for publicly refuting them.\n\nWith Trump already feeling embattled by Woodward’s book, Republicans’ patience for anonymous dishing about the White House is growing thinner. This is not the time for more drama, they say: The party’s congressional majorities in Congress on the line, and a government shutdown deadline is weeks away.\n\nSeveral senators said in interviews that the op-ed author should resign and go public if he or she wants to make a point.\n\n“You work at his pleasure [of the president]. If the moment comes when you know longer work for him, you should leave. And if you feel that you saw things you didn’t like and the public deserves to know, you should say it publicly and you should say it in your name,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). “It’s not a good precedent to set for our republic.”\n\nIf the op-ed writer intended on drawing out more public critics in the administration or Congress, there was no evidence on Thursday that it had worked. And now, some of Trump’s closest allies say the party is determined now more than ever to rally around him.\n\n“I think it’s actually helping the president, I really do, to have something like that happen,” said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). “There’s a turncoat in there. I just think that has the opposite effect than intended.”", "clickbait": null}

At the root of this fear and loathing is mutual incomprehension: Liberals simply don’t understand conservatives, and vice versa. In years past, the historical profession has done little to improve matters. Liberal historians typically treated conservatives and their ideas with disdain, when they deigned to notice them at all.\n\nThe end-of-century victories of Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich, however, forced historians to realize that conservatism could no longer be dismissed as a mere road bump on the inexorable progression toward a liberal future. The result, over the past two decades, has been a veritable tsunami of historical literature on conservatism. Virtually all of these works have been written by liberals. Nonetheless, historians of this new generation consider themselves to be unbiased and even sympathetic observers of conservatism. Many believe their collective efforts have produced a profound historical understanding of conservatism as an intellectual and cultural phenomenon, and thus contributed in some measure to bringing politically opposed citizens together.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nColor me skeptical. I was a graduate student at the beginning of this new wave of conservative studies and I couldn’t help but notice that it coincided with the historical profession’s purge of any scholars who could be described as Republicans or conservatives. Some of the new works on conservatism have been excellent, others awful. But nearly all reveal the pitfalls for liberals writing about a movement with which they have no personal experience. If you’re a historian who has not a single conservative colleague—and perhaps not even one conservative friend—chances are you’ll approach conservatism as anthropologists once approached tribes they considered remote, exotic, and quite possibly dangerous.\n\nThe result is that two decades’ worth of scholarship hasn’t contributed as much as one might have hoped to our understanding of conservatism, especially in the age of Trump. This is particularly true of the works that have been most popular with the broader public. That’s a shame, because historians could provide deeper answers than they have so far to the questions many citizens now wrestle with: How did our political system become so divided and dysfunctional? To what extent is the conservative movement responsible for Trump’s rise? What have been the movement’s greatest successes as well as failures, and what relevance do they have to our understanding of ourselves as a nation and a people?\n\nThose answers aren’t just relevant to our understanding of the past. A more robust, even-tempered account of conservatism is key to understanding what role the political and cultural phenomenon will play in our country’s future—whether liberals want to believe it or not.\n\n\n\n***\n\nA common flaw of the new political histories is to take the extreme right as representative of conservatism (or the Republican Party) as a whole. Lisa McGirr’s 2001 Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right was one of the earliest and best of these histories, but many of its readers came away convinced that the rabidly anti-communist John Birch Society dominated the Republican Party in the early 1960s, when it was a marginal element at best.\n\nThere’s little in McGirr’s scrupulously nonjudgmental account of the Birchers that alludes to their wild, conspiratorial fantasies, like the notion that the United Nations was training an army of barefoot African cannibals in Georgia to take over the United States, or that a “1313” committee of University of Chicago eggheads was plotting to deprive Americans of their rights to vote and hold property. Bircher-type thinking has had a resurgence on the present-day political right and points toward the enduring appeal of conspiratorial thinking in American life, so the organization merits study. But scholars should keep in mind that National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr., as part of his larger “fusionist” project that eventually led to Reagan’s election, branded the Birchers as “kooks” and was able (for a while) to keep them out of the conservative mainstream.\n\nThe success of Buckley and his “movement” conservatives at transforming the GOP into an ideological vessel has led scholars to overlook the internal party warfare between moderates and conservatives that raged throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and continues in a diminished form today. Some scholars also downplay the real differences that separate traditionalists, libertarians, paleo-conservatives and neo-conservatives, among any other number of ideological splinter groups. Like many liberal voters, they assume that the Tuesday Group faction in the House of Representatives is just like the Freedom Caucus, or that Speaker Paul Ryan’s beliefs are more or less interchangeable with those of President Donald Trump or Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\nIn fact, one of the more influential studies of conservatism, Corey Robin’s The Reactionary Mind, insists that such seemingly disparate figures as Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, Milton Friedman and Sarah Palin are all more or less the same, sharing the overarching goal of preserving the ruling order’s power and privilege against liberationist movements from below. In his view, the ideals conservatives tout (greater freedom, robust public morality, economic growth and deference to the Constitution) are nothing but fig-leaf cover for oppression, and anyone outside the elite who thinks otherwise is a victim of false consciousness. Robin—who, full disclosure, helped make my Ph.D. years miserable by leading a grad student unionization effort at my university—advances his argument with considerable force and erudition. But his reductionist thesis is the mirror image of the sloppy right-wing canard that liberalism is no different from socialism, or even communism.\n\nSome scholars bring their present-day political concerns to bear on the past, particularly in relation to the Republican Party’s approach to racial matters, assuming that it’s inherently a party of racial oppression . In this view, African-American demands for racial equality have always entailed a program of economic redistribution—and because such programs are anathema to both moderate and conservative Republicans, then by definition Republicans cannot support civil rights. Of course, this presentist position is at odds with the historical reality, which is that civil rights activists of the 1960s viewed the considerable majority of congressional Republicans as allies, and acknowledged that the movement’s great advances could not have been achieved without their help.\n\nHeather Cox Richardson’s To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party actually posits that the current GOP upholds the racist and elitist principles of the pre-Civil War slaveholding class. Richardson’s account is a mélange of liberal errors regarding conservative history. Like Robin, she dismisses Reagan’s populism as a screen for rapacious business interests. She contends that racism was the essence of Buckley’s New Right, and further that the Birch Society spread his ideas to ordinary voters. Buckley’s endorsement of Southern segregation was a moral blot on the conservative movement, and he later acknowledged it as his gravest error. But it’s anti-historical to assume that Buckley was little more than a Klansman with a large vocabulary, or to dismiss the monumental divisions on the right as minor quarrels within a united white supremacist alliance.\n\nSome of the most highly praised scholars of conservatism in recent years have openly acknowledged their political opposition to the movement. Rick Perlstein, whom New York Times columnist Paul Krugman recently pronounced “our leading historian of modern conservatism,” wrote a column a few years ago declaring “There Are No More Honest Conservatives, So Stop Looking for One.” Perlstein made a big splash in 2001 with Before the Storm, a well-researched account of Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign that even conservatives praised for its empathy and insight. But Perlstein’s subsequent works, Nixonland and The Invisible Bridge, portray conservatives like Richard Nixon and Reagan as cartoon villains, all but ignoring the progressive parts of Nixon’s record and the pragmatic dimension of Reagan’s.\n\nPerlstein’s treatment of conservatism is positively Solomonic, however, in comparison with Duke University professor Nancy MacLean’s Democracy in Chains, a 2017 National Book Award finalist that focuses on Nobel Prize-winning libertarian economist James Buchanan. In MacLean’s telling, Buchanan’s “public-choice” school of economics provided the intellectual blueprint used by billionaire Charles Koch to advance a “diabolical” and “wicked” plan to suppress democracy by handcuffing government—a crime to which the entire Republican Party is now, apparently, a willing accessory. As numerous critics from across the political spectrum have pointed out, MacLean’s conspiracy theory owes more to her strained interpretations than actual evidence, and her account is replete with errors and distortions.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIt’s true that the era when historians ignored conservatism or dismissed it as a curio is over; many universities now offer entire courses on its history. But a closer look at their syllabi typically reveals a paucity of writings by actual conservatives and a glut of hostile interpretations by writers such as Robin, Cox Richardson, Perlstein and MacLean. One teacher of such a course, Seth Cotlar of Willamette University, who was recently the subject of an admiring piece in Vox, apparently believes that the two major conservative intellectuals of the 1990s were Gingrich and Dinesh D’Souza—an error that no one who was personally involved with the conservative movement would ever make.\n\nGingrich was interested in ideas—particularly those of futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler—but he was primarily a political missile aimed at ending four decades of Democratic rule, a goal he would achieve by means both fair and foul. And from what I remember of the culture wars of that era, most conservatives I knew viewed D’Souza as a slippery but useful opportunist. His 1991 book Illiberal Education received wide attention because many people, not just conservatives, were worried about the universities’ drift toward political correctness. Even at the time, however, the leading critiques of higher education came from writers like Jacques Barzun, John Searle, Diane Ravitch, E. D. Hirsch, Alvin Kernan, Frank Kermode, Roger Kimball, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Charlie Sykes, William Bennett, and especially Allan Bloom.\n\nD’Souza’s demagogic instincts were held in check by his desire to appear in such company, and to satisfy gatekeepers like Buckley who wanted the movement to be respectable (and intellectually defensible). The Fox News Channel’s debut in 1996 did much to break down those restraints, with extremism and charlatanry becoming more promising career paths for would-be conservative talking heads.\n\nStill, the serious work of intellectual conservatism at that time came from thinkers who had little to do with the emerging political-media entertainment complex on the right—people like Christopher Lasch, Roger Scruton, Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom, Eugene Genovese, Charles Murray, Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele and Robert Hughes, to name a few. The ‘90s also brought in new voices on the neoconservative/neoliberal front like David Frum, Michael Lind, Andrew Sullivan, Francis Fukuyama, John McWhorter, Richard Brookhiser, Mickey Kaus, Michael Kelly, William Kristol and John Podhoretz.\n\nOf course, not all the works of that period’s conservative tribunes have aged well. Culture wars tend to produce more heat than light. Bloom’s musings on rock and roll seem as ridiculous now as they did then, and few conservative intellectuals still defend Charles Murray’s 1994 The Bell Curve, with its faulty conclusions on race and intelligence—though even fewer support the campus left’s attempts to prevent him from speaking on any other subject. The escalating polarization of the Gingrich era often overwhelmed any attempt at evenhanded analysis, and it’s hard to read the neoconservatives of the 1990s now without thinking of the Iraq War disaster looming on the horizon.\n\nBut the conservatives listed above were for the most part intellectually honest, dedicated to the effort of persuading the unconvinced, and capable of changing their minds in the face of conflicting evidence. Liberals who see the conservative movement as an unchanging monolith of oppression have a hard time understanding why many of the conservative thinkers of the 1990s now oppose Trump and believe the movement has become a shambles.\n\nLiberalism and conservatism have conditioned each other throughout their collisions over the course of American history, the ever-evolving yin and yang of our collective political consciousness. While the present moment may be an exception, American liberals and conservatives have almost always shared the same goals of peace and prosperity, although the means proposed for reaching those goals have usually been very different.\n\nOur current moment of crisis has further strained historians’ attempts to arrive at an impartial, penetrating understanding of American conservatism. Indeed, a growing school of academic thought believes that such a “disinterested” understanding may not be possible, or even desirable. It’s unlikely that a more nuanced history of conservatism will emerge until this latest culture war has run its course.\n\nIn the meantime, liberal historians should consider subscribing to the Claremont Review of Books or National Affairs, while conservatives should pick up some copies of the Nation or New Yorker. At least your anger will be better informed.\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice is director of political studies at the Niskanen Center and the author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party.\n\nThis article tagged under: History\n\nConservatism\n\nPolitical Thought", "clickbait": null}

It serves nearly all of Westminster north of West 92nd Avenue and south of 124th Avenue.\n\nAfter being briefed about the sewer’s capacity, age and condition issues last week, the City Council on Monday night unanimously adopted an emergency ordinance that freezes acceptance of new, large-scale development proposals in the area served by the Big Dry Creek network for up to a year.\n\n“The (sewer) system is now at a trigger point of risk that warrants both near-term mitigation measures, as well as longer-term expansion to support continued development,” a staff memo recommending the emergency ordinance read. “Not addressing these system constraints is believed to compromise the health, safety, and welfare of the community with a level of risk that is not acceptable.”\n\nThe moratorium, which went into effect at noon on Tuesday, is designed to allow a consultant to inspect the sewer, collecting information that will be put to use in a project to fix, expand and replace portions of it, according to a city memo. City staff are expected to work simultaneously to pinpoint spots for where incremental or innovative fixes could be employed and make plans for easements and land acquisitions that might be required by future repair and replace projects. One idea floated at Monday’s meeting was reactivating decommissioned sewer lines in the area to help with capacity.\n\nThe Big Dry Creek system was first assessed in 2012, then again in 2015, according to the city staff. Those studies found “several segments” of the system were nearing the end of their lifespan or were not large enough to handle all of development and growth in the city. The city made plans to overhaul the system starting in 2019 director of public works and utilities Max Kirschbaum said Monday.\n\nBut an assessment done earlier this year — when factoring in projects in the city’s pipeline and flows those could contribute to the sewer system — painted a dire picture. Kirschbaum said the system is already running the risk of a sanitary sewer overflow, an event where raw sewage escapes from a sanitary sewer.\n\nWestminster’s sewer flows have increased by 40 percent since 2008, city officials said. The Big Dry System was dates back to the 1970s, before the city went through several waves of population growth.\n\nThe moratorium applies to new development applications that would increase flows into the Big Dry Creek network. Home renovations or projects that will not add to the sewage flows will not be subject to the freeze, officials said.\n\nApplications and pre-applications submitted prior to the moratorium taking effect will be honored. But developers who fail to follow up a pre-application meeting with more complete planning documents within six months will see their projects expire, according to the city.\n\nEven if a developer has city approval to move forward with plans, they may not be given access to the sewer system. Westminster’s municipal code dictates wastewater service commitments do not take hold until a building permit is pulled. That means builders in the affected area who goes in for building permits may be told the sewer network does not have the capacity to serve their projects. Access to the sewer system will be assessed and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure fairness, city officials say.\n\nJenni Grafton, the city’s acting economic development director, estimated there are between 30 and 40 projects in the affected area that could be in line to pull permits. Some of the city’s premier mixed-used neighborhoods and shopping areas will not be impacted by the development freeze. The Downtown Westminster project, rising where the Westminster Mall once stood, and the Westminster Station transit-oriented development going up around the city’s B-Line train stop, are served by a separate sewer network. The same is true for its north Interstate 25 and Huron Street business district. Those areas include the St. Antony North Health Campus and the Orchard Town Center shopping area.\n\nSeveral developers that have projects on tap in Westminster came to Monday’s meeting to urge the council to move along their projects. Council members sought to assuage fears.\n\nCouncilwoman Shannon Bird said, “We are not closed for business.”\n\nThe city will lift the moratorium before 12 months if possible, but its sewer contractor is expected to need nine months to assess the system.

There was only one space available, and it was marked “Authorized Vehicles Only.” Anxious — you don’t want to have to bail your rental out of a tow pound in Belzoni, Miss. — I looked around and spotted the sheriff escorting a handcuffed prisoner in an orange jumpsuit through the parking lot.

It's the first update to the rankings since POLITICO reported that they create incentives for schools to favor wealthier students over less wealthy applicants. The rankings are so closely followed in the academic world that some colleges have built them into strategic plans.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStill, the top of the U.S. News rankings doesn't look that much different than in years past. The top spots among national universities are still dominated by the Ivy League and other elite private schools. Princeton and Harvard were No. 1 and No. 2. Third place was split among Columbia, MIT, University of Chicago and Yale.\n\nThe formula now includes indicators meant to measure \"social mobility\" and drops an acceptance rate measure that benefited schools that turned the most students away. U.S. News says the changes are based on discussions with college leaders during the last year and the new social mobility indicator is based on newly available federal data.\n\nAmong the colleges that benefited most from the changes was the entire California university system — \"partly due to the universities’ performance graduating high proportions of low-income students,\" said Robert Morse, chief data strategist at U.S. News & World Report.\n\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Over time, our ranking model has put more emphasis on outcomes measures ... As part of this evolving process, we’ve wanted to measure whether schools were successful at serving all of their students, regardless of economic status.\"\n\nThe new social mobility indicators account for 5 percent of the ranking formula. One of them simply weighs the graduation rates of students who receive federal Pell Grants, which go to lower-income students.\n\nThe other indicator takes it a step further and measures the differences in graduation rates of Pell Grant students and students who don't receive Pell Grants at the same school, which Morse said \"evaluates a school’s success at achieving equity between low-income students and their peers.\"\n\nScores are adjusted so schools that enroll the highest percentage of low-income students get the most credit for these graduation rates, Morse said.\n\nThe formula previously only accounted for economic diversity through a measure it calls \"graduation rate performance,\" which controls for factors like test scores and income and predicts what a school’s graduation rate should be. If the actual rate is higher, U.S. News deemed the college was “enhancing achievement, or over-performing,” and it would get a boost.\n\nThat factor remains and when combined with the new social mobility indicators, Morse says 13 percent of a school's rank is now dependent on the economic diversity of its campus.\n\nU.S. News is also no longer factoring in a school's acceptance rate. It used to give a boost to schools with lower rates — a measure many colleges sought to achieve by leaning more on early decision admissions, which hurt lower-income students who apply to more schools in order to compare financial aid packages.\n\nThe publication is also giving less weight to a student selectivity measure that relies heavily on students' scores on tests like the SAT and ACT — which have been shown to correlate with wealth. The measure is now only 10 percent of the formula, down from 12.5 percent.", "clickbait": null}

Forget about a potential showdown to lead the House Republican Conference: The only thing the No. 2 and 3 House Republicans care about is saving their majority, they insist.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the rivalry between the two men is as intense as ever, as the moment of reckoning to determine who will replace Paul Ryan draws closer — and the prospect of losing the House in the midterms grows.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nScalise has been busy raising his national profile in ways that some McCarthy allies feel threatens the California Republican’s bid to lead the conference. In recent months, Scalise, the majority whip, has staked out several hard-line positions favored by conservatives. His moves have put McCarthy in the awkward position of having to follow Scalise or anger the far-right, whose support McCarthy needs to become speaker.\n\nLike McCarthy, Scalise has been barnstorming the country raising money for lawmakers, chits that could be quite valuable if there is an opening to lead the conference. His office frequently touts his fundraising, noting that his totals have eclipsed any previous GOP whip. Scalise’s team doesn’t spell out that McCarthy previously held the job, but the message is clear whom they’re comparing him to.\n\nScalise, who has backed McCarthy for speaker this spring but is considering a bid if McCarthy falls short, recently hired a former political operative for ex-Speaker John Boehner to coordinate his campaign efforts. The Louisiana Republican will name Grant Saunders, Boehner's former deputy executive director, as his political director this week.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMembers and top aides are also privately speculating about whether Scalise would challenge McCarthy for minority leader. Republicans are increasingly concerned that they will lose the majority, though Scalise in an interview last week said he remains confident that won't happen.\n\nAnd with Freedom Caucus leader Jim Jordan expected to run for the top leadership post, some House Republicans have wondered whether Scalise would run as a compromise option for Republicans wary of McCarthy or suspicious of Jordan.\n\nFor now, neither camp will discuss it. During a tri-city sweep in upstate New York last week, Scalise demurred on all questions leadership-related.\n\n“Kevin and I are both friends,” Scalise told a cluster of reporters outside a fundraiser for Rep. Tom Reed fundraiser just south of the Finger Lakes. “And I think Kevin would tell you the same thing that I’m about to tell you: We are very focused right now on making sure that we do our job. Because if we worry about what our titles will be, a few months from now, Nancy Pelosi will be speaker by the time the counting is done.”\n\nAt a backyard barbecue in Syracuse, while more than 150 New York Republicans filled their plates with hotdogs and sautéed mushrooms, Scalise touted vulnerable Rep. John Katko’s work on bipartisan issues he said don’t get much attention in the press. Katko, he said, has “set a record for the most bills passed in a two-year period” — but Pelosi, he warned the crowd, “has targeted this district.”\n\n“You know what is at stake this election,” Scalise said, standing on a deck overlooking donors gathered around a posh pool surrounded by flower beds. “We want to keep passing good bills and solving real problems, and this one guy has over 30 pieces of legislation signed into law. So it’s important that he come back!”\n\nLawmakers remember these sorts of favors. The ability to raise money and gin up the base undeniably factor into the conference's choice of leaders.\n\nIt’s one reason Scalise, who spoke without prepared remarks at three stops that day, and McCarthy have spent all of August on the trail. Of course, they want to keep the majority, but they also are seeking to build alliances ahead of the leadership struggle later this year.\n\nMany House Republicans say McCarthy is still favored to lead the conference. He's next in line and remains the biggest fundraiser after Ryan. In August, he visited 20 cities on behalf of 35 incumbents, raking in more than $4 million. His office said he has raised just over $41 million as of mid-July, and as a \"special guest\" at several events, helped haul in an additional $20 million for 128 members and six candidates.\n\nMuch of that was done with the help of Vice President Mike Pence, who’s been raising money alongside the majority leader. Their joint fundraising committee has been seen by House Republicans as a sort of pass-the-baton arrangement for McCarthy, signifying that he’s next in line to take over for Ryan.\n\nStill, Pence appears to have hedged his bets where leadership is concerned. He not only advised Trump to stay out the leadership struggle that’s expected to ensue after Election Day; Pence also agreed to hold a fundraiser with Scalise and open it up to the press in early August.\n\nThe event, which Scalise’s office said raised $1.4 million, drew notice from political observers who once again saw a whip working to raise his profile.\n\nScalise’s fundraising numbers are smaller, to be sure — though he doesn’t have Pence, a major draw for the party, with him on the trail. Scalise raised just over $12 million to date this cycle, roughly doubling what any previous whip raised at this point in the campaign season, his office notes. He's also been working to build out a digital fundraising platform, raising about $2 million over the past nine months from 40,000 mostly small donors.\n\nThat doesn’t include money Scalise helped raise for members. That was main focus here last week when he chartered a plane to hopscotch events for Katko, Reed and Elise Stefanik — all Democratic targets.\n\nBack in Washington, everything Scalise and McCarthy do is being viewed through the lens of the looming leadership void. Scalise raised eyebrows when he appeared to back the conservative push to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in July — something Ryan and most of GOP leadership have firmly opposed.\n\nThe move jammed McCarthy, cornering him between Ryan, who has endorsed him as his successor, and Freedom Caucus leaders pushing impeachment. Exacerbating his dilemma was McCarthy’s close friend President Donald Trump, who has egged on conservatives in their crusade against Rosenstein.\n\n“They need to comply with subpoenas in Congress, which is a basic constitutional duty that we have,” Scalise said of the Justice Department. “People want to see transparency. They’ve seen that there was corruption at the FBI, and frankly they ought to be working to help us root out bad apples.”\n\nScalise also drew notice when he pitched the idea of forcing Democrats to vote on their controversial proposal to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the Republican Study Committee, garnering praise from rank and file. McCarthy allies said the idea to force such a vote was his idea, not Scalise’s.\n\nBeyond that, Scalise’s full-on embrace of all things Trump has become increasingly glaring. He often goes on Fox News to defend the president. And during an interview aboard his chartered plane between campaign stops, Scalise backed Trump’s tough talk on trade and his posture toward Russia — typically touchy subjects for Republicans. At one point during the day, Scalise compared Trump to Ronald Reagan, a revered figure in the GOP.\n\n\"[There are] tangible signs that Trump's policies are working,\" said Scalise, who put the GOP's odds of keeping the House at \"better than 50-50.\" \"Ultimately, a strong economy with candidates and incumbents who know what’s coming at them is going to hold us [in] the majority.\"\n\nIn Reed’s district that day, Scalise dodged a New York reporter’s question about whether he’d change his mind about backing McCarthy and launch a bid for speaker. Instead, he touted Reed's reelection as though the GOP's majority was riding on it.\n\n“If we lose Tom Reed’s district, we lost the majority,” he said, talking up Reed’s work on tax reform as part of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. “We cut taxes and we’re making America great again. … And Nancy Pelosi wants to reverse that clock. Are we going to let her take it back?”\n\n\"No!” the crowd shouted.\n\nStill, the leadership race was never far from the surface. A woman at the Katko barbecue prodded a Scalise staffer about whether he’d take the helm of the conference next year. And some constituents openly admitted they were there to get a glimpse of a possible future GOP leader.\n\n“He has the potential to be speaker of the House if the Republicans hold on,” said William Shugarts, a retired professor at Reed’s event. “A lot of people have been pushing that, so I thought I’d come and see what he has to say.”", "clickbait": null}

The ICC's chief magistrate said in November that the body would look into allegations of torture and other abuses by Americans in the country. The sanctions could include barring members of the court from entering the U.S.\n\nBolton also warned the ICC not to investigate actions by Israel's security forces against the Palestinians that critics have called war crimes. \"While the court welcomes the membership of the so-called State of Palestine,” Bolton said, “it has threatened Israel — a liberal democratic nation — with investigation into its actions in the West Bank and Gaza to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks.”\n\n“[W]e will not allow the ICC or any other organization to constrain Israel’s right to self-defense,” Bolton added.

Earlier this year, Trump infuriated Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv — an affront to Palestinians who would claim at least part of Jerusalem for their future capital.\n\nPalestinian officials on Monday quickly rebuked the Trump administration. “We reiterate that the rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale, that we will not succumb to US threats and bullying and that we will continue our legitimate struggle for freedom, justice, and independence, including by all political and legal means possible,” a top Palestinian official, Saeb Erekat, said in a statement.\n\nThe Palestinian ambassador to the U.S., Husam Zomlot — who was recalled by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in May, shortly after the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem — blasted the administration’s announcement Monday.\n\nSpeaking of the PLO office closure, Zomlot said: “Such a reckless act confirms that the administration is blindly executing Israel’s ‘wish list,’ which starts with shutting down Palestinian diplomatic representation in the US.”\n\n“We stand firm in our decision not to cooperate in this ongoing campaign to liquidate our rights and cause,” Zomlot said in a statement. “Our rights are not for sale and we will block any attempts at bullying and blackmailing us to forgo our legitimate and internationally endorsed rights.”\n\nIn an apparent reference to the ICC, Zomlot added that Palestinians will \"step up our efforts to hold Israel accountable under international law.\"\n\n“[T]he PLO has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. “To the contrary, PLO leadership has condemned a U.S. peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the U.S. government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise.”\n\n“The United States continues to believe that direct negotiations between the two parties are the only way forward. This action should not be exploited by those who seek to act as spoilers to distract from the imperative of reaching a peace agreement,” Nauert added.\n\nThe administration’s rebuke of the ICC aligns with Bolton’s longstanding aversion to international institutions he views as violating American sovereignty. As an official in the George W. Bush administration in the 2000s, Bolton led opposition to U.S. membership in the ICC.\n\nIn his speech, Bolton laced into the court for what he called its vague definitions of criminality, lack of accountability and spurious claims of authority.\n\n“The United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court,” Bolton said. “We will not cooperate with the ICC, we will provide no assistance to the ICC, and we certainly will not join the ICC.”\n\nA representative for Human Rights Watch on Monday lambasted Bolton's moves against the court as showing \"callous disregard for victims of atrocity crimes.\"\n\nLiz Evenson, associate international justice director for HRW, said in a statement: \"Any US action to scuttle ICC inquiries on Afghanistan and Palestine would demonstrate that the administration was more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers — and deflecting scrutiny of US conduct in Afghanistan — than supporting impartial justice.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Monday that, should the ICC open investigations into U.S. activity in Afghanistan, the administration would consider negotiating agreements to prevent nations from surrendering Americans to the court, and attempt to “constrain the Court’s sweeping powers” through the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThe administration would also weigh banning ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the U.S., sanctioning their funds, and prosecuting them in American courts, Sanders said.\n\nThe administration’s announcement comes days before the 25th anniversary of the Oslo Accords on Sept. 13. Those accords are generally considered the beginning of the formal Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which many experts and diplomats have pronounced dead.\n\nThe UN General Assembly will also convene later this month in New York for its 73rd annual session, with Trump set to preside over a meeting of the UN Security Council expected to focus, in part, on Iran.", "clickbait": null}

John Hickenlooper and other state officials late Tuesday, reigniting a debate over religious freedoms in the public square.\n\nJack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop claims in his lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver, that the state has renewed its “crusade” against him for refusing to create a cake that would have violated his religious beliefs.\n\nAccording to the suit, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that he once again violated the state’s nondiscrimination law when he refused to bake the cake. This time, it was for Autumn Scardina, an Arvada woman celebrating her birthday and the seventh anniversary of her gender transition.\n\nThe commission’s June opinion came despite Phillips’ earlier win at the U.S. Supreme Court over his refusal to make a cake for a gay wedding, the lawsuit says.\n\n“The state of Colorado is ignoring the message of the U.S. Supreme Court by continuing to single out Jack for punishment and to exhibit hostility toward his religious beliefs,” said Kristen Waggoner, legal vice president of Alliance Defending Freedom, the organization representing Phillips.\n\nHowever, the justices’ 7-2 decision in the cake maker’s earlier case was a narrow ruling that kept the state’s nondiscrimination laws intact but said the state commission did not appropriately weigh Phillips’ religious rights.\n\nHickenlooper told reporters Wednesday that he was not involved the commission’s most recent ruling, but said the issue is one of the most thorny he has seen during his public service career. He said he expects the issue to return to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“The first ruling from the Supreme Court did not address the basic issue,” he said, referring to the religious freedom issue, “and that’s what I think the U.S. Supreme Court will have to address this time.”\n\nThe Civil Rights Commission and attorney general’s office declined to comment Wednesday. Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican, has long been a supporter of the LGBTQ community.\n\nTuesday’s lawsuit reignites years of legal debate over how religious beliefs should be considered under Colorado’s public accommodation law. The 2008 state law forbids businesses from discriminating against customers on a variety of grounds including sexual orientation and gender.\n\nPhillips and his cake shop first made national news in 2012, when he declined to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of his religious objections to same-sex marriage. The years-long legal fight ended at the U.S. Supreme Court this June in a decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy, who has authored a number of landmark rulings expanding gay rights, indicated that the decision was not all-encompassing.\n\nAt the time, observers on both sides of the case said the limited decision meant the broader debate would continue to be litigated.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Scardina, a lawyer, filed a complaint with the commission claiming that the cake shop denied her request for a cake — blue on the outside and pink on the inside to represent her transition.\n\nA store employee declined the request because the custom cake would have expressed messages about sex and gender identity that conflict with Phillips’ religious beliefs, according to Scardina’s complaint with the Civil Rights Commission.\n\n“The woman on the phone did not object to my request for a birthday cake until I told her I was celebrating my transition from male to female,” Scardina wrote in her complaint. “I believe that I was not allowed to order a birthday cake because I requested that its colors celebrate my transition.”\n\nScardina on Wednesday did not return requests to comment.\n\nIn a June 28 decision letter, the commission wrote that there was probable cause to believe Masterpiece violated a state law by denying Scardina “equal enjoyment of a place of public accommodation.” The letter ordered the bakery and Scardina to attempt an amicable resolution by compulsory mediation, according to Phillips’ legal team.\n\nJim Campbell, another lawyer for Phillips, said in a statement that Phillips shouldn’t have to fear government hostility when he opens his shop for business each day.\n\n“We’re asking the court to put a stop to that,” Campbell said. “The arbitrary basis on which the state is applying its law makes clear that its officials are targeting Jack because they despise his religious beliefs and practices.”\n\nOne Colorado, the state’s largest LGBTQ advocacy organization, said the new lawsuit was one of several filed in an effort to legalize discrimination.\n\n“All people — including LGBTQ people — deserve to be served equally in public spaces, and no religious belief gives anyone the right to pick and choose whom they serve and what laws they want to follow,” Daniel Ramos, One Colorado’s executive director, said in a statement. “This is another attempt by the ADF to undermine laws that protect Coloradans in the areas of public accommodations, employment, and housing.”\n\nEarlier this year, the state’s civil rights commission became a political flashpoint during the state’s regular legislative session. Some conservative lawmakers attempted to shut down the commission in part because of its role in the Masterpiece cake controversy.\n\nUltimately, Hickenlooper signed a bipartisan compromise that extended the commission through 2027 and changed the makeup of the commission, requiring it be more bipartisan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the governor denounced discrimination, saying “it’s not what America stands for.” He also stressed that he understood the value of a person’s religion freedom.\n\n“This is a difficult question. When you’re talking about people’s religion, it doesn’t matter what religion, it’s one of the most tightly held American freedoms that we have,” he said. “It’s why millions of people fought and lost their lives.”", "clickbait": null}

Or that Cory Booker’s “Spartacus” uprising amounted to a demand for documents that had already been authorized for release.\n\nOne thing Democrats are learning from President Donald Trump as the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh draw to a close: Floating an incendiary charge, with little to no factual basis, can draw the spotlight and force the opposition to prove a negative.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the run-up to 2020, it isn’t the details that resonate with base voters. It’s the show.\n\nDemocrats were never expected to derail Kavanaugh’s nomination in a Republican-held Congress. But his confirmation hearings served as a test for Harris and Booker ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign. And in a pre-primary measured in social media mentions and YouTube-ready moments, Harris and Booker this week came out ahead.\n\nTheir handling of the hearings wasn’t in the same category as some of Trump’s prevarications. But both Democrats showed, during their first high court hearings on the Judiciary Committee, that they too know how to elate their base and wound opponents without an airtight case.\n\nFrom the opening minute of the hearings, Harris muscled to the forefront, kicking off Democrats’ protest on Tuesday by charging that “we have not been given the opportunity to have a meaningful hearing.” She successfully challenged Kavanaugh on the deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as gay marriage, voting rights and abortion.\n\n“Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?” the former prosecutor asked at one point, causing Kavanaugh to stammer.\n\nThe next day, Harris featured the exchange in an email fundraising appeal, while running Kavanaugh-related ads on Facebook throughout the week.\n\n“If you’re with me in this fight, can you sign my petition opposing Judge Kavanagh’s nomination to the Supreme Court as Republicans rush through his confirmation hearings this week?” said one ad running Thursday.\n\nThe ad featured a photograph of Harris next to bold type reading, “Stop Brett Kavanaugh!”\n\nBut Harris puzzled observers when she pointedly asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe with anyone at a law firm that has long represented Trump. Kavanaugh was initially unable to answer the question, before definitively saying Thursday that he had not had such a discussion. Having never followed up on what she described as a “reliable” lead on the matter, Harris’ bid to undercut the nominee seemed to lack a firm foundation by the end of the committee’s marathon hearing.\n\nWhen it comes to exposure, however, the confrontation with Kavanaugh was a success. A C-SPAN video of the exchange posted on social media had nearly 6.5 million views as of Friday morning. The radio host Jerry Quickley played a clip of the exchange on the leftist KPFK radio station in Los Angeles, to which a caller glowed, “That senator was great!”\n\nFor Harris, the anti-Kavanaugh campaign had its intended effect. Her fans swooned.\n\n“Dear @senjudiciary, where do we send @KamalaHarris all the mics to drop?” the comedian Samantha Bee wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnd Harris’ doggedness, for many in her party, mattered more than her ultimate lack of evidence to back up her questioning.\n\nOne Democratic aide pointed to Kavanaugh’s own “evasive and tortured answer on the first day of hearings” as the reason that Harris and other Democrats kept digging in about the Trump-connected law firm.\n\n“If he had just given a straightforward answer to a simple question, he could have saved everyone a lot of time,” the aide said.\n\nHarris has spent more than a year raising her profile by confronting the president’s nominees, starting with her vote against the confirmation of John Kelly to head the Department of Homeland Security. She was one of only 11 senators to oppose Kelly’s confirmation, and she attracted another round of attention when Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told her at a confirmation hearing last year to be more “courteous” on the dais.\n\nWhile Harris and Booker appeared only to cheer their Democratic base, Republicans saw a longer-term opening for a future counter-attack. Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant who has long opposed Trump, criticized Democrats for adopting a tone that he said mirrored the president himself.\n\n“Listening to the junior Senator/Presidential candidate from CA,” Murphy said on Twitter. “The sneering tone of many of these questions from D’s on the Judiciary Committee is really offensive. Amazing how they can (correctly) condemn Trump for his tone yet act like this.”\n\nYet Harris’ Republican colleagues were relatively restrained in their response to her opaque inquiry. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) even rephrased her questions in an attempt to make it easier for Kavanaugh to answer — a seeming nod to their effectiveness.\n\nIf Booker had an opening to overshadow Harris, it appeared to come Thursday, when he vowed to release once-confidential records from Kavanaugh’s years in the George W. Bush White House. In what he likened to an “‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” Booker said he would risk expulsion from the Senate to release the documents himself.\n\nBut Republicans said the records had already been cleared for release, and the GOP spent days mocking the New Jersey senator.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) quipped after Booker let loose his confidential-documents gambit that “running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,” while Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) made a subtle joke Wednesday about Booker’s lengthy monologues.\n\nJudiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), known for his dry humor, asked Booker at one point “how long you’re going to say the same thing three or four times.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee distributed a memo criticizing Booker under the subject line, “Spartacus Of Newark’s Performance History,” and Sen. Marco Rubio, (R-Fla.) ridiculed Booker on Twitter.\n\n“On this day in 71B.C. the Thracian gladiator Spartacus was put to death by Marcus Licinius Crassus for disclosing confidential scrolls,” he wrote. “When informed days later that in fact the Roman Senate had already publicly released the scrolls, Crassus replied ‘Oh, ok, my bad.’”\n\nThe conservative opposition group America Rising kept a running tally of how many minutes of his own questioning time Booker used to speak, which dwarfed the number of minutes the nominee spent responding. Gayle Trotter, a spokeswoman for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, urged red-state Democrats to reject the “embarrassing performance” by their liberal colleagues on the panel, singling out Booker and Harris.\n\nBooker sought to wear the criticism as a badge of honor, telling CNN on Thursday night that Cornyn had leveled a “deep insult” by calling his conduct unbecoming for a senator. He said he persisted because “I was raised and taught that an unjust law, you almost have an obligation to stand against it.”\n\nHe also contended that he had first broken the rules as early as Wednesday night, when referencing then-confidential records while questioning Kavanaugh. And after the GOP revealed Booker’s initial document release had it in fact been confidential, he followed up by releasing more confidential records.\n\nWhile confusion over the documents’ release left Booker with a less-than-clean hit, Democrats outside the hearing room delighted at his tactics. The Women’s March, a group that galvanized progressive activists following Trump’s election, hailed Booker for “modeling exactly what we expect of every member of the Senate.” The Texas Democratic Party updated its announcement of Booker’s planned appearance at the party’s Johnson-Jordan dinner on Saturday to include praise for him “showing political courage by releasing confidential documents” in the hearings.\n\nHarris and Booker are among a growing number of Democrats who have pledged to no longer accept money from corporate political action committees, and the publicity from a week of nationally televised hearings could help them broaden their followings in the run-up to 2020. Harris has spent heavily to court small-dollar supporters online.\n\nYet in an era of short attention spans and non-stop news from Washington, it is unclear how enduring such a lift might prove.\n\nPaul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster, said, “We could have seven new stories that fly in the middle of everything, and Kavanaugh could be forgotten in 24 hours.”\n\n", "clickbait": null}

I kind of feel like, ‘Oh no, you have to be in the camp that says sexism isn’t real.’”\n\nBut, she added, that’s far from true.\n\n“There’s certainly a double standard for women in this realm,” said Stuckey, who wrote the popular “Conservative Millennial” blog before becoming a Conservative Review TV host. “Because it’s not just about what we say, it’s about how we say it.”\n\nStuckey, whose online videos have racked up millions of views and hundreds of thousands of followers, is no stranger to harassment on the internet or on the airwaves. But she says females’ responses are consistently cast in a sexist light.\n\n“If we get into a conflict on air, it’s not just that it was heated; it was that it was a cat fight, or she freaked out about something,” said Stuckey, who is a frequent commentator on Fox News. “There are constantly evaluations about how we look, comparing us to other women. Just because we might have the same hair color, we might think the same.”\n\n“I do get a lot of hate,” she added. “And I think as a conservative, people assume that as a conservative I don’t acknowledge sexism, or I say there’s no double standard, or sexism doesn’t exist. Well, that’s certainly not where I am.”\n\nStuckey, who also hosts a podcast called “Relatable,” rose to prominence among conservatives for her takes on culture and politics from a millennial perspective that also focuses largely on her faith.\n\nIn recent months, the 26-year-old stepped into the national spotlight with a parody video where she conducted a fake interview with congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was slammed by some media outlets for not explicitly labeling itself as satire.\n\nBut on the Women Rule podcast, Stuckey hit back at her critics.\n\n“It surprised me,” she said. “A lot of people on the left just can’t tolerate someone on the right making a joke, because the only humor now that is protected is humor that is against conservatives or against President Trump.”\n\n“If you say something bad about Trump, about the first family, about conservatives, you can be as vulgar, as mean, as hateful as possible and people are still going to laugh and it’s going to be okay. But if you make a lighthearted, clean joke about someone on the left, then you are going to get dragged through the mud by The Washington Post.”\n\nTo hear more about Allie Beth Stuckey’s rise to conservative media fame and who she looks up to in the Republican party, listen to the full podcast here.

All but one were from the high-tax Democratic states of New York, New Jersey and California.\n\nIf successful in the House, the legislation would not likely be taken up in the Senate soon, though experts believe provisions on retirement savings and tax assistance for start-up companies could find bipartisan support eventually.\n\nDubbed “Tax Reform 2.0”, the House package is intended to augment President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul, which added $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit by providing permanent tax cuts for U.S. corporations, but only temporary individual tax cuts that are set to expire after 2025.\n\nRepublicans insist Trump’s tax overhaul and actions to deregulate industry are boosting the economy. But that has been undercut on the campaign trail by worries about Trump’s policy on trade tariffs and a lack of evidence that tax cuts have delivered promised pay increases to workers.\n\nDemocrats, who opposed last year’s bill, have also cast Republican tax cuts as a giveaway to big corporations and the rich that will lead to cuts in Social Security and Medicare, claims that Republicans deny.\n\nThe new legislation would add another $576 billion to the deficit, even taking potentially higher economic growth into account, the Tax Foundation said.\n\nThat number could rise if Republicans made an estimated $1.1 trillion in individual tax cuts permanent, but scaled back or eliminated the SALT deduction cap, which is a revenue raiser.\n\n“If this were likely to be enacted in the near term, those numbers would be difficult to square,” said David Noren, a tax partner with the law firm McDermott, Will & Emery.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the 2.0 package’s main author, plans to unveil draft language for three bills early in the week and put it to a committee-level vote on Thursday, with a full House vote following by Oct 1.\n\nAside from making individual tax cuts permanent, Republicans say the legislation will including savings provisions intended to help small businesses offer 401(k) retirement plans, allow 529 education savings plans to pay for apprenticeships and provide access to retirement savings for costs related to births and adoptions.\n\nRepublicans say the legislation will also seek to encourage start-up businesses by allowing them to write off more start-up costs and add investors without limiting tax benefits, such as research and development credits.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The U.S. Capitol is pictured on the opening day of the 112th United States Congress in Washington, January 5, 2011.

Or perhaps you would have worried about the limits and biases of the mainstream media.\n\nBut in the digital age, when speech can exist mostly unfettered, the big threat to truth looks very different. It’s not just censorship, but an avalanche of undistinguished speech—some true, some false, some fake, some important, some trivial, much of it out-of-context, all burying us.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor the longest time, we thought that as speech became more democratized, democracy itself would flourish. As more and more people could broadcast their words and opinions, there would be an ever-fiercer battle of ideas—with truth emerging as the winner, stronger from the fight. But in 2018, it is increasingly clear that more speech can in fact threaten democracy. The glut of information we now face, made possible by digital tools and social media platforms, can bury what is true, greatly elevate and amplify misinformation and distract from what is important.\n\nDeluged by apparent facts, arguments and counterarguments, our brains resort to the most obvious filter, the easiest cognitive shortcut for a social animal: We look to our peers, see what they believe and cheer along. As a result, open and participatory speech has turned into its opposite. Important voices are silenced by mobs of trolls using open platforms to hurl abuse and threats. Bogus news shared from one friend or follower to the next becomes received wisdom. Crucial pieces of information drown in so much irrelevance that they are lost. If books were burned in the street, we would be alarmed. Now, we are simply exhausted.\n\nIt’s not speech per se that allows democracies to function, but the ability to agree—eventually, at least some of the time—on what is true, what is important and what serves the public good. This doesn’t mean everyone must agree on every fact, or that our priorities are necessarily uniform. But democracy can’t operate completely unmoored from a common ground, and certainly not in a sea of distractions.\n\nHow can we get back to that common ground? We need new mechanisms—suited to the digital age—that allow for a shared understanding of facts and that focus our collective attention on the most important problems. That might sound nebulous or difficult or even impossible in the current chaos. But consider that the modern state or today’s public health systems also seemed difficult or impossible at many points in human history.

I used to work at a grocery store, and a couple of Russian teenagers are checking out at my register.

My friend and I are both fluent in Russian and English, but we primarily speak English. One day, while we were at a museum, we got bored and decided to go up and down the glass elevator. We kept giggling, making jokes, and it was a great time until some woman with her family got in. She quickly chose her floor and remarked to her family (in Russian) that we were acting stupid and were ugly. As she got out of the elevator, my friend and I yelled out (also in Russian) \"Have a nice day!\" and the look on her face is one I will never forget. —sleepingoctopi\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. This very mature comeback: OK so my parents are both Indian and I look very Indian. There's no indication from my appearance that I would speak French AT ALL. So I got into a lift at my apartment complex and these two men walked into the escalators, speaking in French about VERY RACIST stuff. So when the lift got to their floor, I held the lift door open and gave them a piece of my mind, ending with a polite and charming “bonne journée!” before closing the door of the lift. They literally had their jaws drop to the floor. They were so uncomfortable and I felt very proud of myself that day! —manasvinib\n\n5. This annoyed retail worker: I work in retail and live in an area with a high density of Filipinos. I was born and raised in the US, but understand and speak the language. Two Filipino ladies came in and started looking around. I greeted them and asked where they were from. Then they asked me where I was from because I look Filipino. But because I’m born in the US, I don’t have the accent. So when I said I was from the US, they said to each other that I was dumb for not knowing the language, that my parents are stupid for not teaching me, and that kids like me make the country look bad. Then they asked me for a product in a size that we didn’t have. When I went to start her transaction, she started getting angry about how everything was so expensive, that I’m stupid, and how I obviously don’t know what I’m doing. So after I finished her transaction, I told her to have a good day in our language and she looked at her friend, then back at me, and walked away. Her face when I spoke the language to her was definitely worth it. —123adrienne\n\n6. This awkward nail salon experience: One time, I went to this Vietnamese nail salon and had a pedicure. I walked in and said that I'd like to have a pedicure please. They didn't expect a thing and thought I'm just another mixed Asian kid who doesn't know Vietnamese. The lady that I had was like, \"Yeah I'm good, will do\". Right away, she started to gossip with the lady next to her about how I have a beard and ugly-ass toes. I immediately told her that I know Vietnamese, in Vietnamese, and the look on her face was hilarious. —t44aa36efc\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. This satisfying plot twist: I speak English and Italian fluently so I don’t get many of these experiences living in the US, but it happened one time, when I was at JFK airport in the check-in line on my way to Rome to visit my family. I had standby tickets because my uncle is a flight attendant. I got to the front of the line and a lady calls us to her and while we’re taking out our passports. Soon after, she was saying things like “Why do these stupid people always come to me.” and “Ugh, this bitch can’t even dress. What’s the matter with her husband? What a dumbass.” in Italian. Her supervisor didn’t even respond, probably because he knows better than to do that. So while she kept talking shit about us, I got a call from my mom, who I only speak Italian to. I smiled and talked in Italian (nice and loud for the lady to hear), “Hi mom! Yeah we’re getting our tickets right now. Tell Nonna I said hi and we’ll see her in the morning. Ok, bye!” I look up at the lady and her eyes were wide open and her mouth just dropped. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone so mortified. Her supervisor looked so pissed off at her. He took our tickets and said “Oh cazzo!”, which means \"oh shit!”. He then said, “Stefania! That’s Diego’s niece.” To which she looked even worse because my uncle worked for the company for YEARS and is well known and liked. —saraf46cbcaf4c\n\n8. This situation with nosey diners: Since I grew up in America, no one thought I spoke Kannada. Once in India, my grandparents took me and my brother out to eat. We cannot drink tap water so we kept having to order bottled water. I guess the table nearby heard my grandma explain that we were foreign and the woman sitting there said, \"What do you think? Are they spoiled brats or too weak to handle the spice?\" As I walked out, I made sure to ask my Grandma something in Kannada and glare at the woman. —melonette000\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. This failed assumption: While I was born and raised in Malaysia, I prefer speaking English with some of my friends because it's a habit my family instilled into me at a young age. I went on a short vacation in a small state area. I was on the phone with my friend and was waiting in line at a food stall when two young women behind me said some stuff in my mother tongue out loud. \"Do you think she can speak our language? She's gonna' take longer time to order because she doesn't even know what they sell here. These tourists are so annoying!\" she said. After getting off the phone, I purposely ordered in Bahasa Malaysia, loud and clear for those women in the back, complete in the state's dialect as well. Needless to say, those women stood as far as possible from me afterwards. —heraf\n\n10. This priceless interaction at the zoo: I was at the zoo with my son when I was 39 weeks pregnant with my second son. Two Spanish speaking teenage girls made fun of how slow I was and said that I walked like a cow. The look on their faces was priceless when they heard me speak to my son in Spanish. I really enjoyed their embarrassment and was sure to flash them the bitchiest smile I could muster. —tenfoldsnails\n\n11. This awkward wait for the flight: I speak Norwegian, which means I can pretty much understand Swedish and Danish. I had been sitting at the Denver airport waiting for my flight to London when a group of about ten Danes started sitting around me. I had already been sitting there for a good two hours and by the time this family came around, the seats at the gate were all taken. A few of the family members got seats and a few had to sit on the floor. They started making nasty comments about all the people around them and in general calling Americans fat and stupid. It wasn't long before their comments were pointed in my direction. They were complaining that I was such a bitch because I had not gotten up to let them sit together. I was at the end of a row so it's not like they had to sit on either side of me. Then they started saying that I was only pretending to read the book because \"Americans are too stupid to read.\" The funny thing was, I was reading a Norwegian book. So when I heard this, I adjusted my book so they could see the title. Once they realized I probably understood them, they started trying to pretend they were talking about someone else. I got to board before them, so when I stood up I told them in Norwegian they can have my seat now. They all seemed extremely embarrassed. —kristinb456001448\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. This person who shut down a whole group of people: I was in France with on an exchange trip. At school, my partner’s friends were calling me the “dumb American” and saying how I “probably didn’t even know what they were saying\", and making fun of my small size. I laughed along, but just quietly added that I could understand them. The look on their faces was priceless. They didn’t make fun of me anymore. —ptoe\n\n13. This ultimate win: A few years ago, I was backpacking through Peru with a few friends. From the moment we arrived, we realised that everybody assumed we were American (we are Belgian) and that we did not speak any Spanish (all of us did). So we decided to use those assumptions to our advantage when negotiating on prices and such. About a week in, we were trying to arrange a hiking trip to the Colca Canyon. We overheard one of the people at the agency tell his co-worker to charge us triple of their normal asking price \"because these Americans are filthy rich anyway\". Naturally, we immediately switched to Spanish to let them know we heard and understood everything. They were so mortified we only had to pay half of the normal asking price. —elodied49a59e38e\n\n14. And finally, this wholesome customer: I walked into a take-out restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island just minutes before closing time. Immediately the two employees started talking to each other in Spanish, viciously complaining about me walking in and expecting service so late. THEY. WERE. FURIOUS. Foul language and all. Then they proceed to ask me in English what I wanted , so I give them my order in my native language, Spanish. The poor girls immediately bury their face in their hands, and apologize to me saying they were actually talking about someone else they served before me. One of the girls was so embarrassed she was about to cry. I told them not to worry and that I understood their frustration. They had been working non-stop all day long. I would be tired and pissed too. I left a 20% tip, thanked them for the food and went home. —n499ae0620\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote: Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.\n\nWant to be featured in similar BuzzFeed posts?

( 83 )\n\nA first concern after a breast cancer diagnosis is often about survival—beating the disease. The medical term for how long you will live after diagnosis is your \"prognosis.\" For many women, the prognosis is good. More than 8 of 10 women diagnosed and treated for breast cancer are still alive 10 years later.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding \"Five-Year Survival Rates\"\n\nThe stage of your breast cancer is a measure of how advanced the cancer is. This helps determine treatment. It also affects the estimate of your prognosis.\n\nBreast cancer stages go from 0 to 4. They're often written in Roman numerals, I to IV. Stage 0 means the cancer has not spread beyond the breast. Stage IV means the cancer has spread outside the breast to other parts of the body.\n\nWilliam C. Lloyd III, MD, FACS Medical Reviewers: Last Review Date: 2017 May 12 2018 Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. All rights reserved. May not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\n\n\n\nDoctors who study and treat breast cancer use five-year survival rates when talking about prognosis. They assign each stage a five-year survival rate. The five-year survival rate is a measure of how likely a woman with breast cancer is to survive five years after diagnosis, compared to a woman in the general population without breast cancer. There are many variables that affect the five-year survival rate within each cancer stage.\n\nHowever, here's a general way to think about five-year survival rates:\n\nFor stage 0 and stage I cancers, the expected five-year survival is 100%. This means the person with breast cancer is just as likely as a person without breast cancer to survive five years beyond their diagnosis.\n\nFor stage II cancer, when cells have not spread outside the breast, the average five-year survival is 99%.\n\nFor stage III cancer, when cells have spread but not far beyond the breast, the average five-year survival is 85%.\n\nFor stage IV cancer, when cells have spread to other parts of the body, the average five-year survival is 26%. This means the person with breast cancer is 26% as likely as a person without breast cancer to survive five years beyond their diagnosis.\n\nWhat’s Your Prognosis?\n\nIt's very important to know that five-year survival rates are only averages. Many people who survive five years will continue to survive for many more years. Your personal prognosis depends on more than your cancer stage. Other factors that can influence your prognosis are:\n\nYour age\n\nYour overall health\n\nThe type of cancer cells you have\n\nHow you respond to your treatment\n\nFor more information, ask your oncologist about how these factors affect your individual prognosis, including how your specific type of cancer may respond to treatment.\n\nIn general, breast cancer prognosis is improving every year. The number of people dying from breast cancer has been going down steadily since 1989. There are close to three million American women living today who survived breast cancer.", "clickbait": null}

Only one family member, then-3-year-old Vanessa, survived, but with severe facial injuries.\n\nThe Colorado Bureau of Investigation previously submitted a DNA profile taken from frozen evidence from Smith’s murder to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System.

The killer had sexually assaulted Smith and days later Debra Bennett and her young daughter.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, The Denver Post received a tip that a DNA match had recently been made between the suspect in the Lakewood and Aurora killings and a prison inmate in Nevada. The tip included the prison booking number and the name of the offender serving a lengthy prison term for attempted murder and use of a deadly weapon.\n\nBrooke Santina, spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Corrections, said she could not comment on any link between the Nevada inmate and the Colorado murder cases. Santina confirmed that an inmate matching the name and prisoner number The Post provided is incarcerated in Nevada and is eligible for parole in 2021.\n\nWhen asked whether authorities had made a DNA match between the specific Nevada inmate and DNA taken from Colorado murder victims, Santina said she had been in contact Tuesday with Arapahoe County authorities and was awaiting their approval before commenting.\n\nDenver TV station 9News reported Tuesday that multiple law enforcement sources confirmed that they are looking at a suspect who is being held in another state.\n\nAurora police spokesman Bill Hummel declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nThe alleged suspect in the case has been convicted of previous crimes, including attempted murder, use of a deadly weapon, burglary and aggravated escape.\n\nThe description of the Nevada inmate matches some aspects of a genetic snapshot of the 1984 suspect produced by Parabon NanoLabs, a Virginia company that created a profile using DNA predictions of the suspect’s ancestry, eye color, hair color, freckling and face shape.\n\nIn June 2002, then-Arapahoe County District Attorney Jim Peters obtained a John Doe arrest warrant in the Bennett killings based on the DNA. Peters charged John Doe with 18 counts, including three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of sexual assault, first-degree assault and two counts of sexual assault on a child and burglary.\n\nThe same killer is believed to have first struck Jan. 4, 1984, when he slipped inside an Aurora home and used a hammer to beat James and Kimberly Haubenschild.

Only 1,642 of them, or about 60 percent, have been positively identified.\n\nThe New York City Medical Examiner’s Office has worked for 17 years to identify the remaining 1,100 victims. Using advances in DNA extraction techniques over the past five years, it has made five more identifications.\n\nThe advances have been bittersweet for 9/11 families who unsuccessfully fought to stop the city from making a park out of Staten Island’s enormous Fresh Kills landfill, where 1.8 million tons of Twin Towers debris was dumped and buried.\n\n“We are grateful that the identification continues, but there is more material that could have been part of that had the city not been so cavalier with us,” said Diane Horning, who led a failed court battle by a group called World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial that hoped block the park project.\n\nHorning led the group, although her son Matthew was one of those identified early on. Matthew, 26, a database administrator for an insurance company, was working the 95th floor of the North Tower when the planes hit.\n\nNew York’s Second Circuit Court of Appeals found in 2009 that accusations that the city had mishandled the remains at Fresh Kills amounted to “lack of due care,” which was not sufficient to successfully sue the city.\n\nAndrew Schweighardt holds a vial with a DNA sample at the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York during an event in New York City, New York, U.S., September 6, 2018. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nNew York officials said at the time that the city did not intend to be insensitive or offend victims’ families.\n\nTo create the park, Fresh Kills Landfill was covered with layers of soil and other materials to prevent the release of toxic gas from decomposing trash into the atmosphere, according to the Freshkills Park Alliance, New York City’s nonprofit partner in developing the park.\n\nCharles Wolf lost his wife Katherine on September 11 and her remains have not been identified.\n\nIf they are in the sealed landfill, he considers it “God’s will” and he is “at peace” with it.\n\n“What’s the remedy? Dig everything up and risk exposing all those toxins again to the environment?, Wolf said. “No, that’s not the answer, because all of a sudden now the cure is worse than the disease.”\n\nSCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH\n\nThe ability to identify more victims is the latest chapter in a saga of pain that began on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when two airliners crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.\n\nDestruction of the Twin Towers was part of the coordinated hijackings of four airliners by al-Qaeda militants that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and western Pennsylvania, where one of the planes crashed in a farm field. The attacks triggered an escalation of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East that persists to this day.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nA scientific breakthrough in the extraction of genetic material was made this year and announced by the New York City chief medical examiner last week, as the 17th anniversary of the attacks approached.\n\nThe new technique places bone fragments in a chamber containing liquid nitrogen to make them more fragile so they can be pulverized into fine powder. The more a bone is pulverized, the more likely it becomes to extract DNA.\n\nIt is the latest effort in the largest forensic investigation in U.S. history, involving a medical examiner’s team of 10 scientists working on remains once thought too degraded from jet fuel, heat and other conditions to undergo testing.\n\n“We’re going back to the same remains that we’ve tried five, 10, 15 times,” Mark Desire, who heads the Medical Examiner’s crime lab, said in the briefing last week.\n\n“We are making DNA profiles from remains we had no hopes of identifying in the past,” he added.\n\nWolf, who was not among those who opposed the Freshkills Park project, was gratified by the renewed effort.\n\n“It warms my heart that possibly there will be remains found for people who still want them,” he said.\n\n“I’ve gone through a lot of trauma with nothing to grieve over,” Wolf said, choking up in a telephone interview. “I remember watching Nancy Reagan touch her husband’s casket. I miss not having that.”", "clickbait": null}

It only happened yesterday,\" he said.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama weighed in on the situation Friday, saying in a speech that the notion that staffers are stealing papers from Trump’s desk and trying to secretly undermine the president is “not normal.”\n\n“These people aren’t elected. They’re not accountable,” said Obama, during a speech at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign billed as the kickoff of his midterm campaigning. “They're not doing us a service by actively promoting 90 percent of the crazy stuff that’s coming out of this White House, and then saying, ‘Don’t worry, we’re preventing the other 10 percent.’ That’s not how things are supposed to work.”\n\nComing on the heels of veteran journalist Bob Woodward’s soon-to-be-published book on the chaos in the administration, the op-ed has unleashed a new wave of paranoia and anxiety in the West Wing, which was still dealing with the aftermath of former aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman’s release of secret tapes she made during the 2016 campaign and as a White House staffer.\n\nTrump has repeatedly encouraged Sessions to probe specific topics or political rivals. Last weekend, Trump questioned why the DOJ filed charges against two sitting GOP lawmakers and early Trump endorsers, Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York, so late in the election cycle that the party could not replace them on the ballot before November.\n\nAddressing one of the anecdotes from Woodward’s book on Friday, Trump cast doubt on the idea that former National Economic Council director Gary Cohn stole a draft letter off his desk that would have signaled America’s intent to withdraw from a trade deal with South Korea.\n\n“He never took a memo off my desk. Gary Cohn, if he ever took a memo off my desk, I would have fired him in two seconds,” Trump said. “He would have been fired so fast.”\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

And he’s worried about his job.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe 48-year-old assistant roller at NLMK Pennsylvania says President Donald Trump’s steel tariffs have driven up costs for his company and left everyone at his western Pennsylvania plant — deep in the heart of Trump country — on edge.\n\n“Trump’s supposed to be making America great again, right? Why isn’t he creating more jobs here instead of taking jobs away?” Southward said in a new edition of the POLITICO Money podcast.\n\nSouthward spoke from his spot in the “pulpit,” a control room high above a conveyor belt that presses 10-inch-thick steel slabs into thin, rolled coils for resale. “We just want it to go away, man, so we can continue with our jobs. That’s all that’s talked about around here anymore.”\n\nStories like that of NLMK are playing out across the country from Iowa soybean farmers slammed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs to Michigan auto industry workers worried about the metal tariffs and the impact of proposed levies on imported cars and parts.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAs troubling headlines about the impact of tariffs pile up, Trump is preaching patience, repeatedly arguing that tariffs are “the greatest” and will eventually lead to better trade deals while reviving the steel industry and boosting U.S. automakers.\n\n“Just be a little patient,” he told farmers in Kansas City, Missouri, last month around the time he announced a $12 billion federal bailout for agricultural exporters hit by the fallout.\n\nBut patience is quickly running thin at places like NLMK, which buys steel on the world market. Company president and CEO Bob Miller said NLMK has paid an extra $100 million since Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on imported steel went into effect. He says he can’t buy the steel slabs he needs from domestic sources. And that means higher prices for his customers and ultimately consumers. His pleas to the Commerce Department for an exemption have so far come to nothing.\n\n“On one hand, you might think you’re helping jobs and increasing jobs, but on the other hand, you’re going to affect jobs here,” Miller said. “And I think our 1,200 jobs here in western Pennsylvania are just as important as jobs in Granite City or across this country.” He was referring to a steel plant in Granite City, Illinois, that reopened after the tariffs and received a visit from Trump in July to celebrate.\n\nDemocrats, sensing an opportunity to make inroads into Trump country in the industrial Midwest and farm belt during the midterms, are hammering away at the tariffs.\n\nNLMK lies just to the north of the western Pennsylvania district — which Trump won by more than 20 percentage points — that Democrats wrested back in a surprise special election victory by Conor Lamb in March. Democrat Amy McGrath is hammering incumbent Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) over the impact on Kentucky bourbon. And Democrats are also using tariffs in House races in New Jersey, Iowa and California and Senate races in North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee, among other places.\n\nThe political calculus — largely backed up by most empirical studies on the impact of tariffs — is that Trump’s trade actions will wind up hurting more industries and workers than they help.\n\nOne place they are helping is the Mon Valley Works – Edgar Thomson Plant, a facility owned by U.S. Steel on the banks of the Monongahela River in Braddock, Pennsylvania, that’s been in operation since 1872.\n\nPOLITICO interviewed more than a dozen employees arriving and leaving work and in the surrounding community over a period of two days. None agreed to provide their last names because they were not authorized by U.S. Steel to speak on the record. U.S. Steel executives declined requests for interviews. Most of the workers said they backed Trump in 2016 and were at least generally supportive of the tariffs.\n\n“A lot of people don’t like Trump. But Trump’s the one that’s turning things around the way it should be,” said Steve, a caster water control operator. “Everybody’s got to give it a chance to play out. Like China, they’re guilty. Other countries are guilty. We’ve been giving everybody a break for years upon years.”\n\nDan, who works in the shipping department at the plant, said the tariffs would benefit more than just U.S. Steel. “It’s not just steelworkers benefiting from the tariffs. It’s the food suppliers and the boot suppliers and the clothes suppliers and the parts suppliers that keep us running,” he said. “So it’s a trickle effect, and then our employees and everybody else that works with us make decent money.”\n\nBut even these workers, direct beneficiaries of the steel tariffs in the short run, expressed some concern over Trump’s long-term plan.\n\n“I’m not sure yet. Waiting to see. I don’t think a trade war is good with anybody. You know what I mean?” said Bob, who operates a machine that moves steel around the plant. “So we’ll see what these tariffs do, but I’m undecided on that. It’s too early to tell, OK? It’s good for individual companies — but the overall economy, I don’t know about that.”\n\nDave, who works in maintenance and production, said higher steel prices created by the tariffs might be unsustainable. “I think it’s going to help us in the short run, but I don’t know about in the long run if it’s going to help us,” he said. “The price of steel has doubled since he’s done that, and I don’t know if that’s going to last. Since I’ve been there, it’s never been nowhere near that price. So I’m just skeptical about the whole thing.”\n\nThere was also significant skepticism about Trump’s motivations in applying the tariffs, potentially an early warning sign for the White House, though the president’s overall approval rating among Republicans remains historically high.\n\n“I don’t think anything he does is going to help us,” said Mike, a contractor who does electrical work at the plant. “Everything I think he does is for personal gain.”\n\nThe problem for Trump and the GOP: There are a lot more workers in industries that use steel and aluminum than in companies producing them, tilting both the potential economic and political gains from the tariffs away from him.\n\nEconomist Jed Kolko estimates there are 415,000 jobs in companies that produce steel and aluminum while 4.6 million work in industries that use the metals, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAt NLMK in Braddock, which is owned by Russian steel giant Novolipetsk Steel, workers argue that Trump’s tariffs will indeed wind up hurting more people than they help.\n\n“It’s like a double-edged sword. They probably do need tariffs on certain stuff and it’s helping some people and hurting the other people,” said Robbie Smith, a roller who’s worked at the plant for over 20 years. “It seems like we’re the ones it’s going to hurt if they stick with it.”\n\nMiller, the CEO, said he could handle the tariffs for now, with the economy as strong as it is. But that won’t last forever.\n\n“If we see this market start to slow down and if we see selling prices start to fall, then yes, those jobs are at risk,” he said.", "clickbait": null}

Chiu/AP Photo Politics GOP attacks Obama, but doesn't defend Trump Leading Republicans took issue with the former president's scathing speech, but none disputed that Trump has threatened core American institutions.\n\nTwo days in, lots of prominent Republicans have complained about Barack Obama’s speech on Friday calling Donald Trump’s presidency a betrayal of America and a threat to its core — but they haven’t said he’s wrong.\n\nMost prominent on that list is Trump himself, who, for a man his aides have often held up as someone who punches back, has so far said less to attack Obama than he has previously about the FBI, Steve Bannon, LeBron James or pretty much anyone else.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEven the president’s Twitter feed has been relatively quiet, despite rainy days in Washington keeping him off the golf course. He retweeted his social media director Dan Scavino’s post of a video Obama made during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel’s show a few weeks before the 2016 election, sneering that Trump would never be president. He quoted former Rep. Jason Chaffetz on Fox News saying that Obama (initially misspelling the first name as “Barrack”) had never delivered on the economy like this White House. But since then, Trump has wandered off onto other topics.\n\nVice President Mike Pence called it “very disappointing” that Obama broke with the recent presidential tradition of not criticizing successors, and in an interview on Fox News on Sunday he scoffed at “the same tired arguments that he and liberals have made over the last eight years” — though he was presumably referring to the last 10 years, since Obama’s first campaign. “The truth is, the American people in 2016 rejected the policy and direction of Barack Obama when they elected President Donald Trump,” Pence said.\n\nMuch of Obama’s speech, which launched his campaigning for the midterm elections, was a condemnation of attacking American institutions, journalists, the Justice Department and decades of global leadership while refusing to condemn Nazis or dishonesty. Neither Pence nor other leading Republicans disputed that these are hallmarks of Trump’s presidency.\n\n“What President Trump provides for this country every day is strong and decisive leadership in the Oval Office,” Pence said, in another pre-taped appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation. “The truth is, I think President Donald Trump is the most accomplished president of my lifetime and I think already one of the most successful presidents in American history.”\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMany Republicans landed on similar responses — that Obama should remember that he lost and Trump won, that he should think about how he created the backlash that led to that win, and that his own record was full of much of what he was complaining about now.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has struggled since the 2016 GOP primaries to distance himself from Trump while also knocking Democrats, woke up on Saturday after the speech with seven tweets trying to thread the needle of that argument. According to one of them :\n\n“Pres. Obama is right. It is wrong for a President to use divisive language, such as:\n\n1. Call all opponents of same-sex marriage bigots\n\n2. Call the Pro-Life movement a ‘War on Women’\n\n3. Call all immigration enforcement advocates racists\n\n4. Call the GOP the enemy of Hispanics.”\n\nTrump isn’t right, Rubio appeared to be suggesting, but neither was Obama. He quoted the former president’s making fun of Nancy Reagan and defending his heavy use of executive orders instead of legislation, and pointed to Obama’s dismissive attitude toward critics of his policies on immigration and the Iran deal.\n\nA pox on both their houses and everyone else, according to Rubio.\n\n“We should ALL, the Dems, the GOP, the media, admit our role in turning politics into theatre,” Rubio tweeted . “Being outrageous equals clicks, viewers & therefore ratings & $ for media & fame for politicians. Being normal gets you ignored & a primary challenger for being ‘too weak.’” Rubio won his Senate seat in 2010 by running a tea party challenge to Charlie Crist, Florida’s Republican governor at the time.\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Trump ally, made the same argument, not defending the president but condemning Obama along with him.\n\n“I find it richly ironic that he talks about the fact Trump is a symptom, not the cause,” Christie said on ABC’s “This Week,” centering on one of the key lines from Friday’s speech. “If he’s right and Donald Trump is the symptom of a cause, well, Donald Trump got elected in 2016 after eight years of Barack Obama as president. He can’t detach himself.”\n\nChristie said nothing, however, to dispute the broader point that Trump is an avatar of a politics that’s gone wrong.\n\nTrump himself on Friday appeared to be most upset by Obama’s asserting that he should be given the credit for today’s strong economy, since the upturn that Trump is enjoying started years before he was elected.\n\nPence didn’t dispute the numbers. He disputed the perception of the numbers.\n\n“I know he said that, but I don’t think too many Americans noticed it,” Pence told CBS’ Margaret Brennan when asked about the claim.\n\nObama’s focus on Trump’s attacks on journalists provided the most openings for calls of hypocrisy.\n\nHe said that “it shouldn’t be Democratic or Republican to say that we don’t threaten the freedom of the press because they say things or publish stories we don’t like. I complained plenty about Fox News, but you never heard me threaten to shut them down, or call them enemies of the people.”\n\nHe left out, however, that his administration prosecuted reporters as part of leak investigations, and that he himself regularly ducked the press. Even during his stop at a café in Urbana, Illinois, after the speech he looked at one reporter and said, “Hey — I’m not going to answer any questions.” And when another asked whether he was enjoying being back on the trail, he responded with a pat on the arm and shaking his head about engaging.\n\nObama’s approach to the media was the only part of his speech that Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s counselor and reliable bulldozing defender, pushed back on in her appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “You know that President Obama was investigating journalists,” she told Jake Tapper.\n\nThe main theme running through Republican responses to Obama’s return is excitement to have him to run against again, given how much damage Trump’s presidency has done to the GOP’s efforts to hold on to power in the fall.\n\n“Obama demonstrating once again that his chief priority is Obama, not the success of the Democratic Party,” tweeted Ben Shapiro, a conservative radio host and The Daily Wire’s editor-in-chief. “If he cared at all about his party, he’d shut up and go away. Now he’s uniting Republicans against him.”\n\nThat earned agreement from Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush: “If Obama knows what’s good for Republicans, he’ll retake the field and be highly visible this fall.”\n\nAnd, some Republicans argued, that’ll also be good news for Trump himself.\n\n“The more President @BarackObama speaks about the ‘good ole years’ of his presidency, the more likely President @realDonaldTrump is to get re-elected,” tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who used to call Trump crazy and dangerous and now condemns anyone who calls the president as crazy and dangerous. “In fact, the best explanation of President Trump’s victory are the ‘results’ of the Obama Presidency! The Obama years were dominated by higher taxes, slower growth, big government, a broken military, and a pathetically weak foreign policy. The voters found in Hillary Clinton more of the same. They wanted a better way.”", "clickbait": null}

No rooms, no tourists, no business and no money to make.\n\nJust last week, the iconic Hawk’s Cay Resort finally reopened, with its 450 rooms. Most hotels expect to be fully rebuilt and reopened by the end of the year.\n\nHurricane Irma destroyed 25 percent of the homes in the Keys, including 3,000 trailers. Finding new, affordable housing continues to be a major challenge. The St. Columba Episcopal Church in Marathon is helping. It just purchased an old apartment building to rehabilitate to provide small apartments for the working class.\n\n“While it’s beautiful and fun down here, it’s still a world of hurt,” said Debra Andrew Maconaughey, St. Columba’s rector.\n\nAnd the Florida Keys Land Trust is building 750-square-foot cottages on hard hit Big Pine Key.

The list to move into one is long.\n\nMany Irma victims gave up and left the Keys, moving north to rebuild their lives. Many lost everything. But for those that have chosen to stay, despite the annual hurricane threat, their resiliency survived.\n\n“You may not notice the improvements, but Islamorada looks great,” said Leopold. \"They really put the whole town back together.\"\n\nFox News producer Ivonne Amor contributed to this report.

A day after refusing to call on CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta at a news conference in England and bragging about his “takedown,” Trump last July, for instance, tweeted that Acosta was “actually a nice guy.”\n\nFormer Trump aides Gary Cohn Rob Porter are targets of the president’s ire for “leaking” to veteran reporter Bob Woodward. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo\n\nPeople who have interacted with Trump over the years said he can sell two opposing viewpoints because he doesn’t see them as such.\n\nWhen it comes to the Woodward book, in particular, “he has to call it fiction because it criticizes him, that piece is just a given,” said Jack O’Donnell, a former president and chief operating officer of the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City, who has since become a critic of his former boss. “He also loves attacking people. He’s comfortable when he’s doing that. As a tack, he doesn’t associate the two. He can say the book is fiction and then go out and attack individuals he thinks spoke to Woodward.”\n\nO’Donnell said it’s part of a classic Trump playbook. “The same person can be a good guy and a bad guy,” he said. “He does that regularly. He changes every five minutes because it’s all about the attention span, and who is the last person he spoke to, and what light does it put him in in any given moment. That’s what can change his whole approach.”\n\nOther longtime associates said in the case of the Woodward book, Trump would be better off changing tack completely: embracing the narrative whole hog, rather than trying to discredit it on multiple fronts at once.\n\n\"Trump is level-headed. It's the other guy who is taking the stuff off of his desk,” said Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, referring to a scene in the book where Cohn steals a letter off of the Resolute Desk to prevent Trump from withdrawing from a trade agreement with South Korea. \"My strong recommendation is Trump buys 1 million copies and carpet bombs them into every congressional district in dispute and he will win them all.\"\n\nBannon said Trump should stop bashing both the author and his former aides, because in his view the book demonstrates that Trump stayed the course, even beset by a set of advisers misleading him -- and that Trump, alone, understood how national security and trade deals are linked. “If he acts like a 5-year-old,” said Bannon, “I want more 5-year-olds on the National Security Council.”\n\nAnother former adviser said most of Trump’s anger is likely driven by the fact that he never had the opportunity to sit down with Woodward, despite the author’s repeated requests for an interview.\n\nBut even when it comes to whether or not Trump knew about the interview request, he appeared to want to bet on both sides of the coin: he claimed he didn’t know anything about Woodward’s attempts to reach him, while also admitting in the same conversation that “Sen. Graham actually mentioned it quickly in one meeting.\"\n\n“He has always spoken highly of Woodward over the years,” said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser. “He reveres these people. He would have loved to participate in this book. I can tell you, the idea of a Bob Woodward, he lives for that.\"\n\n", "clickbait": null}

I know it's not much, but where can I begin? —Curtis, 37\n\nYou're in luck. There are plenty of places to start investing with as little as $500. Even far less.\n\nNumerous investing apps and robo-advisors will put your money in the stock market starting with just $5. You even have enough money to open a brokerage account with some firms.\n\nBut with all these options, it's hard to know where to start.\n\nFirst, make sure your finances are in good shape before taking on investment risk. Build an emergency fund and keep any money you might need within five years out of the market, said Rachel Rabinovich, a CFP at Society of Grownups.\n\nBut investing in stocks is a good way to grow your money for a longer-term goal because you'll have time to recover from dips in the market.\n\n\"You need to be OK with losing the money you invest, at least in the short-term,\" Rabinovich said.\n\nIf you do feel comfortable putting a some money in the stock market, here's how to decide what investing platform is best for you.\n\nRelated: So, why shouldn't I buy bitcoin?\n\nIf you'd like some investment help\n\nWith some robo-advisor platforms, you can invest a small amount of money in a portfolio that considers some of your preferences, like how much risk you're comfortable taking on. It's usually based on a questionnaire.\n\nA portfolio will give you more diversification than investing in a single stock. Plus, it could include low-cost index funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) that you might not have access to otherwise. Many require minimum initial investments when buying on your own.\n\n\"It's nice to have something set up a portfolio for you. That's what we do as managers, so you're getting that service a little bit on the cheap with a robo-platform,\" said CFP Andrew McFadden, the founder of Panoramic Financial Advice.\n\nSometimes you're charged a fee based on the amount of money in your account. Betterment and Wealthfront, for example, both charge a 0.25% account fee. That amounts to $1.25 a year on $500.\n\nRelated: Are apps a good way to start investing?\n\nStash and Acorns charge a monthly fee of $1 a month, which can be a relatively high percentage for someone investing just $500.\n\nThese two apps offer something a little different. Stash allows you to choose a selection of stocks and ETFs that are focused on different themes, like technology or clean energy. Acorns connects to your credit card and rounds up your purchases to invest the spare change, as well as lets you set up bigger recurring or one-time investments.\n\nBoth Stash and Acorns require just $5 to start investing.\n\nIf you want to do it yourself\n\nThere are a handful of brokerage firms out there that allow you to open an account with $500 or less. They probably won't charge an account fee like a robo-advisor because you'll be picking your investments yourself, but there are usually commission fees ranging between $4 and $7 per trade.\n\nBut while you might be allowed to open an account with just $500, each fund has its own minimum and you might not have enough money to invest in what you want.\n\nIf you have more money to invest, you can get access to even lower-cost index funds and ETF options.\n\nIf you just want to pick a few stocks\n\nInvesting in a few single stocks is more risky than investing in an index fund or ETF, which spread out the risk.\n\nBut it may not be such a bad idea if you're investing a small amount of money. It could be a good learning experience to help you understand what makes the stock price move, McFadden said.\n\nIn that case, he suggests buying three to five stocks in companies that you're interested in.\n\nRelated: Why you might want both a traditional 401(k) and a Roth\n\nOnce your investments grow to about $10,000, it's time to set a new strategy or decide you want a professional — robo or human — to help.\n\nAn app called Robinhood allows you to invest in single stocks without paying any trading fees. There is no account minimum, but you have to have enough money to buy a full share of individual stocks or ETFs. You cannot buy fractional shares.\n\nThe app also allows you to invest in stock options and cryptocurrencies, but Rabinovich doesn't recommend buying those more complicated investments as a beginner.", "clickbait": null}

All the economic indicators, what’s happening overseas, Donald Trump has proven to be far more successful than Barack Obama.”\n\nGrowth since the recession of 2008-09 has been slower than after any other recession since World War II, and the distribution of the growth has been less equal than in the past.

crisis by accusations that he covered up sexual misconduct by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, Francis has refused to respond, his accuser has changed his story and a host of new characters have entered the fray.\n\nCardinals, bishops, priests and ordinary faithful are demanding answers, given that the Vatican knew since at least 2000 about allegations McCarrick had bedded seminarians.\n\nFrancis is coming under increasing pressure to respond to claims by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano that he rehabilitated McCarrick from sanctions Pope Benedict XVI had imposed.\n\nHere is a look at the scandal, which has split the U.S. Catholic hierarchy and further tarnished Francis’ record on abuse.\n\nAlessandro Bianchi / Reuters Pope Francis arrives to lead the Wednesday general audience in Saint Peter's square at the Vatican, August 29, 2018.\n\nWHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL ACCUSATION?\n\nVigano said in his Aug. 26 expose that Benedict imposed “canonical sanctions” on McCarrick in 2009 or 2010 that were similar to what Francis imposed this summer after McCarrick was accused of groping a minor.\n\n“The cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate Mass in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance,” Vigano wrote.\n\nVigano said he told Francis on June 23, 2013, that McCarrick had “corrupted a generation of seminarians and priests” and that Benedict “ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.“\n\nBut he said Francis effectively rehabilitated McCarrick and made him a trusted counselor as he sought to remake the U.S. church leadership to be less focused on the culture wars.\n\nThe public record, however, is rife with evidence that McCarrick lived a life devoid of any sanction from 2009 onwards, traveling widely for the church, attending official functions, including at the Vatican alongside Benedict and Vigano, who as Vatican ambassador in 2012 had the duty of honoring him at an awards ceremony in New York.\n\nStringer . / Reuters Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano speaks at an ordination in Brooklyn, New York, on July 20, 2015\n\nHOW HAS VIGANO’S STORY CHANGED?\n\nFaced with such evidence, Vigano altered his story to say that while Benedict’s measures were in place, McCarrick “didn’t obey” them and Vigano was unable to enforce them.\n\nVigano told LifeSiteNews, an ultraconservative site, that Benedict had made the sanctions “private” probably because McCarrick was retired and Benedict, seeking to avoid scandal, thought he would obey.\n\nEven the conservative National Catholic Register, which originally published Vigano’s revelation, acknowledged that the severity of the measures reported by Vigano is now an open question.\n\nCiting someone close to Benedict, the Register reported that Benedict couldn’t recall how he handled the matter but that there was no formal decree against McCarrick, “just a private request” to keep a low profile.\n\nIf true, that would undercut Vigano’s core accusation that Francis rehabilitated McCarrick from actual canonical sanctions.\n\nHOW HAS THE POPE RESPONDED?\n\nHours after Vigano’s accusations came to light, Francis told an in-flight news conference: “I will not say a word about this .” He challenged journalists to investigate Vigano’s claims and said, “If time passes and you’ve drawn your conclusions, maybe I’ll speak.“\n\nThat said, Francis has referred indirectly to the scandal a few times since. He has said “silence and prayer ” are often the best response to people seeking scandal. He has said it is un-Christian to accuse other people, but necessary to accuse oneself to recognize sin. And he has told newly ordained bishops to work in communion — not as lone actors bent on settling personal scores.\n\nThe Vatican press office has refused all comment, declining to say what, if any, sanctions were ever imposed on McCarrick, and what, if anything, Francis did about them.\n\nWHAT WAS GOING ON IN 2013?\n\nWhen Francis and Vigano met in June 2013, Francis was three months into a new job where he knew he was going to make enemies with the type of conservative culture warriors Vigano championed.\n\nA month after the reported encounter over McCarrick’s sexual past, Francis would go on to win praise from the liberal Catholic world for saying of another purportedly gay priest he had named a close adviser: “Who am I to judge?“\n\nThat suggests that Francis, at least in 2013, didn’t consider the past sex lives or homosexual orientation of his counselors to be a firing offense — or recognize that those relationships could constitute an abuse of power.\n\nBut Francis did recognize something was amiss when he sent the Vatican’s top sex abuse expert to investigate Scottish Cardinal Keith O’Brien, who recused himself from the conclave that elected Francis pope because of allegations he slept with seminarians.\n\nO’Brien was a conservative hard-liner on homosexuality whose sexual peccadilloes were aired publicly, which could explain the disparity in treatment.\n\nMorteza Nikoubazl / Reuters Ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was removed from ministry after he was credibly accused of sexually abusing a teenager 47 years ago. McCarrick has also been accused of sleeping with seminarians.\n\nHOW HAS THIS BEEN RECEIVED IN THE US?\n\nMore than a week before Vigano’s disclosure, the head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, announced he wanted an audience with Francis to present his request for a full-fledged Vatican investigation into the McCarrick affair.\n\nAt the time, DiNardo’s call was seen as a power play by the U.S. bishops, who were under fire for having covered for McCarrick for decades, to shift the blame to the Vatican. McCarrick was made archbishop of Washington and cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II, despite knowledge in the Vatican that he slept with seminarians.\n\nDiNardo followed up his request for a Vatican investigation with a statement saying Vigano’s accusations deserve answers. More than a dozen U.S. bishops have echoed the call, though others, including a top Francis appointee, Cardinal Blase Cupich, have demurred. Cupich has said Francis shouldn’t go down the “rabbit hole” by responding.\n\nNo date for a DiNardo audience has been set. But he is due in Rome on Sep. 27 to preside over a deacon ordination ceremony for seminarians from the North American College, the U.S seminary just up the hill from the Vatican.\n\nMeanwhile, Francis has met with embattled Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who is facing calls to step down over both the McCarrick scandal and for mishandling some abuse cases when he was bishop in Pittsburgh. Those cases were exposed in a recent Pennsylvania grand jury report.\n\nIn another blow to Wuerl’s ability to lead, one of his own deacons said in a letter published Sunday that he could in good conscience no longer assist him at Mass, and called for him to step down.\n\nWuerl actually offered to resign two years ago when he turned 75, so the decision on when he leaves rests with Francis alone.\n\nWHO IS NOW SPEAKING OUT?\n\nAmid the official silence from the Vatican, some new players have emerged to try to discredit Vigano’s version of events and defend Francis.\n\nOne of them is a familiar face, the Rev. Federico Lombardi , the Jesuit who served as Vatican spokesman for Benedict and Francis until 2016. Last weekend, amid a communications crisis for the Vatican, it was announced that Lombardi would rejoin the Jesuit magazine La Civilta Cattolica, which serves as an unofficial mouthpiece for the papacy.\n\nAlso last weekend, Lombardi and his English-speaking assistant, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, issued a joint statement contesting Vigano’s version of events about the controversial meeting that Vignao orchestrated between the pope and U.S. anti-gay marriage campaigner Kim Davis during Francis’ 2015 visit to the U.S.\n\nThe encounter made headlines because it was viewed as a papal endorsement of Davis’ highly politicized campaign — something Francis had been keen to avoid.", "clickbait": null}

Fifteen years ago, Alvarado emigrated from San Luis Potosi in central Mexico, and has worked in the fields of California’s Central Valley ever since, picking food—broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, potatoes—and religiously listening to La Campesina, not for the prizes or the Mexican music, but because of the singular role it plays in the life of the farmworker community.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStop by any group of farmworkers here, and you’re likely to hear La Campesina. That’s as intended—the network was founded in 1983 by Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers with the goal of reaching farmworkers in the fields, and it is operated today by the Cesar Chavez Foundation. But where Chavez originally dreamed of programming that would serve the needs of Spanish-speaking immigrants by educating them about workers’ rights, today’s political climate demands something different to serve the immigrant audience. Though it’s happened largely out of the view of the mainstream news media, throughout Western states, La Campesina has adapted to the political moment by becoming something like the immigrant community’s version of Radio Free Europe—a voice of idealistic defiance broadcasting in hostile territory—at a time of deep partisan animus toward Latinos. Now, with nine stations across four states—from Yuma, Arizona, in the south to the tri-cities of Washington in the north, broadcasting in both AM and FM—it reaches more than 1 million regular listeners, many of them immigrants working in hotels, restaurants, and manufacturing or food-processing plants.\n\nWhile AM radio is often thought to be the turf of conservative talking heads, La Campesina’s KNAI is frequently the top-rated AM station in metropolitan Phoenix. In April, it had double the ratings of KFYI, the local station that carries Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck, competing against those broadcasting titans with regional Mexican music, resistance-themed commentary en Español, and practical life tips for getting by as a Latino immigrant in Trump’s America.\n\nAmong Campesina’s most popular regular segments: advice on what to do if approached by an agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For Alvarado, the radio contest winner, the prospect of being detained by ICE looms as her biggest fear. “We need to be on the lookout for la migra because they are going strong right now and they want us out of this country,” she says. It’s one of the main reasons she listens religiously to La Campesina: She and her colleagues carry a portable radio with them in the fields because they see the station as a lifeline.\n\nThat’s a role the radio network plays on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican listeners in San Luis Rio Colorado and Mexicali tune in to Yuma’s KCEC for its immigration-related programming. Other listeners as far south as Mexico City, Guatemala and El Salvador stream La Campesina’s programming online. All can hear tips on how to best avoid ICE and the resources available to them if they are detained.\n\n“We are a beacon of hope for immigrants and people who are coming to the country who do not necessarily have their footings here or don't necessarily know where to go for help,” says Cesar L. Chavez, grandson and namesake of the civil-rights leader and the general manager of La Campesina’s Bakersfield station for the past six years. “We try to guide them in the right direction.”\n\n“There is no wall for us,” says Maria Barquin, a longtime La Campesina employee who now directs programming for the entire network. “The signal crosses the wall.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe genesis of La Campesina came in 1962, when Cesar Chavez, along with leadership of what would become the United Farm Workers of America founded the National Farm Workers Association and adopted a resolution calling for the creation of a once a week, 30-minute Spanish language radio program to entertain and educate farmworkers. From that seed grew the vision for Radio Campesina, which formed in 1983 not as a single show, but an entire station—Visalia’s KUFW.\n\nToday, La Campesina’s programming consists of popular regional Mexican music hosted by colorful deejays, public service announcements and educational programming. Their daily network educational program, “Punto de Vista” (“Point of View”), covers topics related to immigration, health and education, with experts invited on to speak about those topics.\n\nWhen immigration raids expanded in California earlier this year, La Campesina adopted a new slogan to fits its more aggressive posture in opposing the crackdown—“La estación siempre en guardia,” or “the station always on guard.”\n\nHosts receive on-air phone calls from farmworkers who’ve encountered ICE and are willing to share their stories. Attorneys and psychologists offer educational commentaries, advising the immigrant community how to cope with the anxiety of family separation. In between, the station broadcasts an announcement from their current campaign: “Since the beginning of [the Trump] administration, the community has had to adapt to a new way of living. Millions of Latinos live in fear of seeing their families separated by an ICE detention. That is why at Radio Campesina, we are a station that is on guard against these actions. Here, we will tell you how to prepare your family with information that can help you in the case of a raid. Not having a status in this country does not make you a criminal. Get ready and act.”\n\n“We are protecting our community and informing them of their rights by giving them information about what to do if they get detained or if a friend gets detained,” says Barquin. This advice includes how to get representation by an attorney and how to secure their families and properties if they are deported.\n\nIn April, Radio Campesina’s team traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, to meet the migrant caravan that had traveled from Central America (and earned the ire of President Trump in the process), and broadcast a live show from across the border, hoping to create a bridge between immigrants wanting to enter the U.S and immigrants who are already there. Besides bringing together both sides of the border through their airwaves, La Campesina hoped to create awareness with all people, even those who are not part of the immigrant community.\n\nLa Campesina also traveled to the border in response to Trump’s family-separation policy. It broadcast live reports after every update on the issue. The crisis prompted the network to relaunch its annual “En guardia con mi voto” or “Get out to vote” campaign, with a more aggressive posture than ever before.\n\nThis summer, Campesina has expanded its efforts to reach a new audience: the sons and daughters of immigrants, people who see themselves as having a sort of dual identity. In Fresno, KBHH “Forge” has become the network’s first bilingual station (it already has an English-language station in Bakersfield; Forge is aimed at listeners who can speak both languages). “Forge” will follow the same strategy as its Campesina brethren but will play Top 40 music with a twist of Spanish-language songs.\n\n“The kids of those listeners of Radio Campesina are growing up,” says Barquin. “This generation needs to have empowerment maybe in a different language. We understand that they have the same roots as their parents in the culture that they love, but we also understand that the language and the music is something that is evolving as they come to a different country.”\n\nIt’s a country that, according to Alvarado, gives opportunities to immigrants that their homelands could not. “We came here to work, not to commit crime. We came here to progress,” says Alvarado. “We are not stealing, and they are not giving us anything for free. We are working for it.”\n\nOn the day Alvarado won lunch, local disc jockey Marimar Flores stopped by to help deliver it, and congratulated her on winning the contest. Alvarado’s fellow farmworkers let out a celebratory cheer and lined up for helpings of pork in green chile, salad, rice and beans. While they ate, a representative from a local health care provider taught them how to make a medical appointment. Throughout, it had the feeling of a celebration.\n\nWhen the food was gone and their plates cleared, the farmworkers waved goodbye to the radio station’s van as it drove away, kicking up dust in its wake. They retied their bandanas over their faces and returned to the fields, where the tinny sound of La Campesina would waft alongside them until they stopped working.\n\nAlondra De La Cruz, a White House Correspondents Associations Scholar, is a multimedia reporter from the Central Valley in California pursuing a master’s in journalism from UC Berkeley.

That’s Nuts. Let’s make one thing absolutely clear: The polygraph is not a lie-detector test.\n\nSince Wednesday afternoon, when the New York Times published an incendiary op-ed by an anonymous senior Trump administration official—one in which the author admits to “working diligently from within to frustrate parts of [the president’s] agenda and his worst inclinations”—the White House has been in a panicked hunt for its author.\n\nThe op-ed could scarcely have come at a worse time for the White House, where hackles were already raised over the contents of Bob Woodward’s newest book, Fear, which paints a portrait of an unstable president out of his intellectual depth and surrounded to some degree by aides who have to work day and night to prevent him from engaging in reckless and destructive behavior.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn order to track down the members of what the Times op-ed termed the “steady state”—that is, senior aides who keep in check a president they view as erratic but whom they are enabling in order to achieve their own policy objectives—Senator Rand Paul recently raised the prospect of subjecting everyone in the White House who holds a security clearance to a polygraph examination in order to root out leakers—even those who share unclassified information.\n\nWe have a combined 30-plus years of experience handling issues surrounding the polygraph, including past congressional testimony on the topic. Relying upon that experience, we can say with considerable confidence that Sen. Paul’s proposal is ridiculous, completely counterproductive and sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nLet’s make one thing absolutely clear: The polygraph is not a lie-detector test. It does not determine if you are telling the truth. The examiner reviewing the readings from the polygraph cannot determine if you are telling the truth. No matter how much Hollywood might try to convince you otherwise, the polygraph is not a mechanized version of truth serum.\n\nThe polygraph is merely a device that evaluates various physiological reactions your body makes when answering questions. It measures your heart rate, respiration and perspiration, among other things. Examiners are trained how to “read between the lines” in terms of what those measurements may suggest about the truthfulness of your answers. If their interpretation of the readings suggests deception, the examiners are further trained in how to coax individuals into subsequently divulging more information in order to “put their mind at ease” so that their reactions will be lessened. Polygraph examiners are skillful and trained interrogators, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nAs part of our law practice, we represent contractors and federal employees working across the intelligence and law enforcement communities who have run into problems with the polygraph. We routinely have to address the fallout of alleged “admissions” made by our clients during polygraph sessions and which are subsequently used as the basis for personnel or security clearance proceedings.\n\nThere are two primary circumstances in which the federal government commonly uses polygraph examinations: one is for the security clearance-screening of individuals being considered for access to classified information (most agencies using polygraphs deal with Sensitive Compartmented Information, some of the government’s most sensitive secrets); and the other is in a more narrow situation where specific allegations of misconduct have been levied against an existing employee or contractor. In both situations, the polygraph is often just one of several investigative tools used to gather relevant and material information.\n\nIt is virtually unheard of to do what Sen. Paul is suggesting: submitting entire offices, departments or agencies to a categorical polygraph screening merely to root out a “mole,” and it would undoubtedly be counterproductive.\n\nMoreover, there is no reason to believe that it would even work as intended. History is littered with actual moles and spies working for years within the U.S. government despitebeing subjected to polygraph examinations. Aldrich Ames and Ana Belen Montes, convicted spies who committed espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union and Cuba, respectively, were able to “pass” polygraph examinations on multiple occasions during their careers in the government. The Department of Justice has itself argued before the Supreme Court that polygraph evidence should be inadmissible in court due to its inaccuracy. Government polygraph experts also acknowledge the existence of false positives (innocent people suggesting guilt) and false negatives (guilty people displaying innocence), calling into question any obtained results.\n\nIt is certainly possible that such a broad polygraph screening would find some leakers. People inevitably crack under pressure, and it is plausible that some subjects would admit to leaking information. But there is no particular scientific basis or reason to believe that it would be the actual leakers the screening was designed to find.\n\nIn the meantime, the entire charade would severely disrupt White House operations and morale, especially if certain senior individuals— such as Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Kellyanne Conway and John Kelly, to name a few—were exempted from the screening (or any punishment for admissions they might make during it).\n\nThe president routinely denounces the ongoing Russia probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as a “witch hunt.” But a broad polygraph screening of the White House would truly be a “witch hunt.” Yes, it might find some peripheral “witches,” but would be unlikely to locate the true perpetrators, and in the meantime, it will have been an incredible misuse of resources.\n\nHumanity has always found the idea of a tool that compels people to be honest compelling. It’s no coincidence that Wonder Woman, who wields a “lasso of truth,” was created by William Moulton Marston, a man who invented an early prototype of the polygraph. But treating the latter like it’s the former is pure fantasy.\n\nBradley P. Moss is a partner at the Washington, D.C. Law Office of Mark S.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) literally shoots a document representing the Republican-led lawsuit that could end a key and very popular Affordable Care Act provision.\n\nThe 30-second spot starts with Manchin mentioning an ad that helped catapult him to the Senate in 2010, in which he took “dead aim” at a complicated cap-and-trade environmental bill that had passed in the House. Manchin, rated by analysts as among the most vulnerable senators on the ballot this year, in the new ad takes aim against the effort to invalidate Obamacare’s insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions medical conditions.\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey, Manchin’s GOP challenger in November’s election, is among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that would allow insurance companies to deny coverage to people with various pre-existing conditions.\n\n“He is just dead wrong and that ain’t going to happen,” Manchin says in his ad.\n\nPatrick Morrisey's lawsuit would take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions. That's just dead wrong, and that ain't gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/QFTSZGnmdK — Joe Manchin (@JoeManchinWV) September 10, 2018\n\nIn a state where polls show approval of President Donald Trump is among the highest in the country, Manchin is making health care the central focus of his re-election bid. And it’s not hard to see why: West Virginia has the highest share of adults with pre-existing conditions of any state.\n\nThe Obamacare protections are “the difference between life and death for the 800,000 West Virginians with a pre-existing condition. I will continue doing everything in my power to protect their access to affordable health care,” Manchin said at a health care forum in Huntington, West Virginia,\n\nLast week, attorneys representing 20 Republican state officials walked into a Texas courtroom and ask a federal judge to invalidate all or parts of Obamacare. District Judge Reed O’Connor appeared sympathetic to their case in oral arguments, but he did not immediately rule on the lawsuit’s motion for an injunction against the law. If it succeeds, experts say it will unleash chaos on the health insurance markets and, eventually, leave an estimated 17 million Americans without coverage.\n\nManchin is a former West Virginia governor whose folksy style and centrist voting record has sustained his career in his state. Indeed, his campaign’s focus on the pre-existing conditions issue stands in sharp contrast to the careful way he has approached Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring last week’s confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, several of Manchin’s fellow Senate Democrats argued that Kavanaugh’s past writings as an appellate court judge indicate he would take an ax to Obamacare if given the chance as a Supreme Court justice. But Kavanaugh has also faced criticism from some conservatives who say he is insufficiently opposed to the law.\n\nManchin has not yet said how he will vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination. He supported Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and Republicans are looking to win him over once more.", "clickbait": null}

Ted Cruz’s lead slipping, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick showed up in Washington on July 25 to deliver an urgent plea to White House officials: Send President Donald Trump.\n\nPatrick, who chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state, made the case that a Trump visit was needed to boost turnout for Cruz and the rest of the Texas Republican ticket. The lieutenant governor soon got his wish: Trump announced on Twitter late last month that he was planning a blowout October rally for Cruz, his former GOP rival.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe previously unreported meeting comes as senior Republicans grow increasingly concerned about the senator’s prospects in the reliably red state, with some expressing fear that an underperformance could threaten GOP candidates running further down the ballot. Cruz’s Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, has raised barrels of cash, closed the polling gap and emerged as a cause célèbre of liberals nationwide.\n\nTrump’s rally is just the most public display of a Republican cavalry rushing to the senator’s aid. Cruz remains a favorite to win another term, and some senior GOP figures insist the concern is overblown. Yet the party — which has had a fraught relationship with the anti-establishment Texas senator over the years — is suddenly leaving little to chance. Behind the scenes, the White House, party leaders and a collection of conservative outside groups have begun plotting out a full-fledged effort to bolster Cruz.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, who’s planning an October fundraiser for Cruz at Washington’s Capital Grille restaurant, said he had a simple directive to GOP givers.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n“We’re not bluffing, this is real, and it is a serious threat,” Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said in an interview. “If Ted does his job and we do ours, I think we’ll be fine. But if we have donors sitting on the sidelines thinking that, ‘Well, this isn’t all that serious,’ or ‘I don’t need to be concerned,’ then that’s a problem.”\n\nThe push reflects a broader anxiety within the party about the electoral environment this fall. It also has practical implications for the GOP: The resources devoted to Cruz include money that could otherwise be used to oust vulnerable incumbent Democrats in red states like North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nWith O’Rourke outraising Cruz more than 2 to 1 during the past quarter, right-leaning organizations have begun routing resources to the state. The anti-tax Club for Growth, which spent millions on Cruz during his 2012 Senate bid, has started a seven-figure advertising blitz aimed at tearing down the Democratic congressman. The organization has begun polling the race, and David McIntosh, the organization’s president, recently traveled to Texas to meet with donors who could help fund the barrage. More than $1 million has been raised so far, people close to the group say.\n\nA handful of other well-funded groups are considering joining the effort, including the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, the Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund, the newly formed Senate Reform Fund, and Ending Spending, which in the past has been bankrolled by major GOP financiers including New York City investor Paul Singer. Some of the groups have been in touch with one another as they weigh their next moves and try to determine how much their help is needed.\n\n“I think there will be a lot of money,” said Doug Deason, a Dallas investor and prominent GOP giver who met with McIntosh.\n\nCruz, who aggressively wooed evangelicals during his 2016 presidential campaign, is taking steps to stir interest among conservative groups. He recently attended a Beltway meeting of the Conservative Action Project, a secretive gathering of movement leaders, where he issued a call to arms to prevent a Democratic coup in his state.\n\nThey are responding in kind. On Thursday, the Senate Conservatives Fund sent an email to supporters asking them to finance Cruz. The Family Research Council is planning a multistop October bus tour through Texas. And this week, Tea Party Patriots is expected to start a phone, text and mail campaign bolstering the senator.\n\n“Texas is one of our top priority states,” said Jenny Beth Martin, the Tea Party Patriots co-founder. “We want to help Ted Cruz be reelected to the Senate because he’s championed our priorities on Capitol Hill.”\n\nThe senator, meanwhile, is relying on the big donor network that fueled his presidential bid. He’s been reaching out to major givers via text message and has recently been in touch with Bekah Mercer, the reclusive conservative megadonor whose father was a primary financier of Cruz’s presidential bid.\n\nLee Roy Mitchell, a founder of the Cinemark movie theater chain, is among those concerned that major donors aren't taking the senator's reelection race seriously enough.\n\n“We’re solidly behind the senator, and I would like to think most Texans are. I believe they are,” said the Dallas-based Mitchell, an active member of the Koch political network who, with his wife, Tandy, has donated a combined $1 million to a pro-Cruz super PAC. “But there’s a tremendous amount of [Democratic] money being poured in here to change people’s opinions.”\n\nAfter antagonizing the K Street set early in his Senate career, Cruz is courting it as he attempts to fill his coffers. Cruz has been regularly inviting high-powered lobbyists to dinners at Capital Grille and other Washington restaurants.\n\nHe’s been candid during the sit-downs about the threat he’s facing for reelection, those who’ve met with him say.\n\nCruz has filled his calendar with fundraisers, including at least three scheduled this week. And he’s turned to veteran Washington players like Wayne Berman, who’s hosted several fundraising events for the Texas senator. Berman, who sits on the board of the influential Republican Jewish Coalition, has also reached out to would-be givers from the pro-Israel and financial industries.\n\n“Cruz has made a concerted effort over the last year and a half to listen and work with many of us around town,” said U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief political strategist Scott Reed, who attended a Cruz fundraiser last week.\n\nCruz is also turning to an old foe: Trump.\n\nThe senator and the president have gotten over their nasty 2016 rivalry, when Cruz called Trump a “sniveling coward” and pointedly refused to endorse him on stage at the Republican National Convention; Trump dubbed Cruz “Lyin’ Ted” and linked Cruz’s father to JFK’s assassination.\n\nNow, Cruz is leaning on the president to turn out voters with the planned October rally. The president’s son Donald Trump Jr. is expected to host multiple events for the senator in the Houston area on Oct. 3.\n\nTrump, aides say, was eager to help. The president personally drafted the tweet in which he announced the rally, which he wrote would be held in “the biggest stadium in Texas we can find.”\n\nSince the 2016 race, Trump has repeatedly told Cruz that he’d like to help him get reelected. Final plans for the event, party officials say, are still being worked out.\n\nAdministration officials are among those who’ve privately expressed concern about the senator’s prospects. Those worries burst out into the open over the weekend, when Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told donors at a Republican National Committee meeting that Cruz could lose, a person familiar with the remarks confirmed. The closed-door remarks were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe sight of national Republicans coming to Cruz's defense would have been almost unthinkable a few years ago. After being elected in 2012, Cruz clashed repeatedly with GOP leadership — he once took to the Senate floor to call McConnell, the majority leader, a liar. But senior Republicans are putting all that behind them.\n\nCornyn, who expects to hit the trail for Cruz in October, lavished praise on his Texas colleague, saying that since the 2016 election he’d become a “team player” who worked collaboratively with fellow senators. In 2014, Cruz snubbed Cornyn, refusing to endorse the state’s senior senator in his primary election.\n\n“We’re all adults, and I’d like to think that we’re professionals,” Cornyn said in the interview last week. “We understand what’s at stake.”\n\n", "clickbait": null}

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nPapadopoulos said on Sunday that he believed he did not incriminate Trump in his 2017 talks with law enforcement.\n\n“I didn’t understand really the nature of what was going on,” he said. “Of course I’m remorseful, I’m contrite, and I did lie, but, you know, you’re just taken off guard, I guess, in a such a momentous situation where you’re potentially sitting there, incriminating the president, even though of course I don’t think I did.”\n\nHe added: “You know, that was probably in the back of my mind, of what exactly am I doing here talking about Russian hacking or election interference with the candidate that I just worked for.”\n\nThe former foreign policy adviser pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his meetings in London with a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud — making Papadopoulos the first person to admit guilt to Robert Mueller in the special counsel’s sprawling Russia inquiry.\n\n“He basically presented himself as this well-connected, well-traveled former diplomat who could essentially connect me and the campaign to Russian officials and to other leaders around the world,” Papadopoulos said of Mifsud.\n\nMifsud told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 that he had obtained “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, and would claim to have amassed troves of emails connected to Clinton’s campaign, according to Mueller’s prosecutors.\n\n“He sat me down and he was quite giddy,” Papadopoulos said. “And he told me, ‘I have information that the Russians have thousands of Hillary Clinton’s emails.’”\n\nA month before that meeting, the emails of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were stolen in a data breach. Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in relation to the crime in July, as well as on charges of cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other liberal targets.\n\nPapadopoulos maintained that he was not made aware of the hacks on Podesta or the DNC, and has testified that he did not tell any Trump campaign officials about his conversation with Mifsud regarding Clinton’s emails.\n\nPapadopoulos said he chose to keep the professor’s claim under wraps because Paul Manafort — shortly after becoming the Trump campaign chairman in May 2016 — quashed the idea of a potential summit between then-candidate Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, which Papadopoulos had been trying to broker.\n\n“As far as I remember, it didn’t seem that Paul Manafort wanted to pursue this meeting,” Papadopoulos said on Sunday. “So as far as I remember, why on Earth would I then, after I was shut down in a, I guess in a formal way, after a lot of vacillating between the campaign, would I then tell the campaign something like that?”\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday it was unlikely that Papadopoulos did not tell other members of the Trump campaign about his talks with Mifsud.\n\n“One thing is fairly clear: This is an ambitious guy who wants to be a player in the Trump campaign,” Warner said of Papadopoulos on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n“Trump had chosen him as part of his foreign policy team,” Warner said. “It just stretches, I think, most people’s credibility that, if Papadopoulos had this knowledge and he wanted to try to further ingratiate himself with the campaign, that he wouldn’t have shared that with somebody on the campaign.”\n\nPapadopoulos also said he had “no opinion on” and “no knowledge of” Trump’s alleged attempts to obstruct Mueller’s investigation, and could not answer whether the special counsel would be able to demonstrate coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\n\n“I have no idea,” he said on Sunday. “All I can say is that my testimony might have helped move something towards that, but I have no idea.”", "clickbait": null}

But there are right ways and wrong ways to do that. The budget change passed in February was the wrong way, removing incentives experts agree are necessary to drive Part D’s successful market-based structure, and potentially jeopardizing the program for the future. One right way is for Congress to address the looming Part D Cliff. In 2020, the donut hole will increase by more than $1,200, raising out-of-pocket costs for the most vulnerable seniors with significant health care needs. Congress should act now on both of these issues to protect seniors from a sudden spike in out-of-pocket costs in Part D, while securing and strengthening the program for the long-term.

USA TODAY\n\nOnce in place, the Ocean Cleanup, dubbed System 001, is deployed. The passive system’s floating series of connected booms naturally form into a broad U-shape. Below the booms, a 9-foot skirt gently corrals the plastic trash that contaminates our seas.\n\nMore: 6 things you can do to stop plastic pollution today\n\nMore: Where did the trash in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch come from? How do we stop it?\n\nMore: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch\n\nCurrents and waves push trash into the machine's center to collect it. Floating particles are captured by the net while the push of water against the net propels fish and other marine life under and beyond.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup System 001 floating in the lagoon in front of the assembly yard in Alameda, Calif. (Photo: Ocean Cleanup)\n\nA garbage ship then is sent out to scoop up the collected trash and transport it to shore for recycling.\n\nThe system is fitted with solar-powered lights and anti-collision systems to keep any stray ships from running into it, along with cameras, sensors and satellites that allow it to communicate with its creators.\n\nOcean microplastics have lasting effects on the ocean: Fish and other marine life mistake the pieces for food and consume them, potentially cutting their digestive tracts, or filling their stomachs so there’s no room for real food, allowing chemicals and contamination to enter the organism and harm it. It can take weeks for the plastic pieces sink to the ocean floor as they become heavier after being eaten and excreted by fish and other animals or becoming covered with bacteria and other organisms. At the ocean floor they can harm deep-sea organisms then eventually covered in silt and entombed on the sea bed.\n\nA multi-year project\n\nThe project is due to the efforts of Boyan Slat, who as a teenager was so disgusted by the plastic waste he encountered diving off Greece that he has devoted his life to cleaning up the mess.\n\nThe non-profit he helped found has garnered support from the Dutch government, individuals and many in the tech world, including Marc Benioff of Salesforce. Last year, it received $5.9 million in donations and reported reserves from donations in previous years of $17 million.\n\nThe system is being built in San Francisco so it can tackle the largest of the world's five trash gyres, the infamous Great Pacific Garbage Patch. These patches consist of huge concentrations of garbage, mostly made up of buoyant plastics.\n\nDue to the gyres (which act like slow-moving whirlpools), the floating trash gathers in areas hundreds of miles across.\n\nOn Saturday, the Maersk Launcher ship took a cleanup machine out to sea, accompanied by seven staff from the Ocean Cleanup, 18 crewmembers from the Danish shipping company Maersk and five independent marine observers.\n\nA press boat followed full of a polyglot collection of reporters and television crews whose presence signals the intense interest the public has shown globally to this audacious plan to clean plastic pollution from the world's oceans.\n\nOccasionally, a small motorboat cruised by the press boat, full of what appeared to be fans of the project shouting \"Hey, Boyan!\" and \"Go, Ocean Cleanup.\" Then the media coordinator explained that it was Boyan's mother, aunt and other family members who'd come over from Holland to witness the launch.\n\nIt will take about five days for the system to reach the testing area, where it will be deployed for about two weeks.\n\nThe path the Ocean Cleanup will take out of San Francisco Bay and into the Pacific ocean Saturday, Sept. 8, 2018 as it launches a test of its plastic pollution cleaning system. (Photo: Ocean Cleanup)\n\nIf all goes well, it will be towed out to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch nearly 1,400 miles off the West Coast, about halfway between California and Hawaii. A support vessel will fish out the collected plastic every few weeks, according to the Associated Press. The waste will then be transported to dry land for recycling.\n\nShipping containers filled with the collected plastic are expected back on land within a year.\n\nThe project is lauded by many as a positive attempt to deal with the growing problem of plastic pollution in the oceans.\n\n\"This is just the beginning of the beginning,\" Slat told USA TODAY. \"It will be a relief to be at this moment, it's the culmination of 5 years of work. But we have a long way to go and lots more testing before the real thing – when we first take plastic out the water.\n\nHowever, many in the marine biology and oceanographic world worry that it could keep the public from focusing on the real problem – stopping the seemingly endless flow of trash into the oceans in the first place.\n\nWhile Rolf Halden, a professor of environmental health engineering at Arizona State University, applauds the effort, he says cleaning while trash pours in doesn't make much sense.\n\n\"If you allow the doors to be open during a sandstorm while you’re vacuuming,\" he said, \"you won’t get very far.”\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2wQOlLa", "clickbait": null}

Ron DeSantis, one of Donald Trump’s staunchest congressional allies, announced Monday that he is resigning his seat to focus on his campaign for Florida governor, a race that was fueled by Trump and has quickly become one of the most-watched gubernatorial battles of 2018.\n\nThe three-term congressman said the move was needed because it’s “inappropriate” for him to continue to draw his $174,000-per-year salary while he's on the campaign trail and missing official congressional business. It’s a message in line with the fiscally conservative persona DeSantis has cultivated in Congress and on the campaign trail.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“As the Republican nominee for governor of Florida, it is clear to me that I will likely miss the vast majority of our remaining session days for this Congress,” DeSantis wrote in his resignation letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan. “Under these circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to accept a salary.”\n\nThe resignation was effective September 1.\n\nDeSantis, a Navy veteran and JAG officer, was focused largely on his primary fight against Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam for the last few months; for the first several months of his primary campaign DeSantis missed less than 10 percent of congressional votes, but that number spiked to 53 percent between July and September, according to GovTrack.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

The federal government, for instance, is set to run out of money in September, which will again set up a contentious vote over keeping the lights on or forcing another government shutdown.\n\nTrump, who has called DeSantis a “warrior,” has already expressed indifference to the notion of a shutdown, indicating he is willing to force a shutdown if he does not get support for his proposed border wall along the southern border.\n\n“If it happens, it happens,” Trump said last week. “If it’s about border security, I’m willing to do anything.”\n\nIn the primary election, DeSantis’ most frequent talking point was about his endorsement from Trump, who both tweeted his support and held a rally for DeSantis in Tampa. DeSantis’ campaign got national attention for a TV ad featuring his toddler building a wall with cardboard blocks, a signal of how closely DeSantis wanted to tether himself to the president.\n\n“Build the wall,” DeSantis says to his daughter in the ad.\n\nThough Florida primary voters remain very supportive of Trump, that close relationship will be viewed differently in a general election, and DeSantis tying himself to a Trump-driven government shutdown would almost assuredly be used against him on the campaign trail.\n\nDemocrats still seized on the resignation, using it as a chance to re-up the talking points they will use to characterize DeSantis as too conservative for Florida’s general election electorate.\n\n“Ron DeSantis’ entire political career has been about helping one person: Ron DeSantis,” Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo said in a statement. “In Washington Ron DeSantis voted to take away health care coverage from millions of people while he showered President Trump with praise on Fox News.”\n\nDeSantis formally shut down his campaign account in July after spending the fund down to $15 cash on hand. Most of his excess funds were transferred to the Republican Party of Florida, which will be heavily involved in his gubernatorial bid.\n\nDeSantis’ 6th Congressional District includes a coastal slice of Northeast Florida just south of Jacksonville. The race to replace him includes former Clinton administration staffer Nancy Soderberg versus Republican Michael Waltz, a businessman and former Green Beret.\n\nIt’s unlikely a special election will be called, meaning the seat will remain vacant until January.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Rizzo's name.", "clickbait": null}

On the next ridge, a row of chimneys marked where houses had stood before the fire.\n\nAs an adult, Sand created Grabbit the rabbit, a cartoon mascot for emergency preparedness. She marketed Grabbit-themed products, such as a kids’ backpack stuffed with necessities for a quick escape.\n\nBut last December, when a predawn wildfire came roaring toward the same home where she grew up, Sand was taken by surprise. She learned of the fire only when a friend saw it from the freeway and called to warn her.\n\nStorm Tracker: Florence's projected path\n\nSand grabbed her laptop, purse, phone and some papers, and hopped into her car.

She left the pool uncovered and found it, when she was able to return three days later, filled with ashes.\n\nGrabbit would not be impressed.\n\nOne of several homes destroyed by a wildfire on Lauren Sand's street in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles last December. The predawn blaze raced up a hillside before most residents realized they were in danger. No one was killed, but few were prepared. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)\n\nA land of natural hazards\n\nAmerica is riddled with fault lines and bordered by storm-tossed oceans, with two great north-south mountain ranges but none running east-west to keep Arctic air from flowing south and tropical air from going north.\n\nThere are hurricanes in the Southeast and nor'easters in the Northeast; tornadoes on the lower Plains and blizzards on the upper Plains; earthquakes and volcanoes along the Pacific Coast, which also is vulnerable to tsunamis; sinkholes and lightning in Florida; avalanches in the Rockies and flash floods in the Appalachians; hail from Minnesota to Texas and ice storms from Wyoming to Maine; lake-effect snow from the Great Lakes and the Great Salt Lake; and monsoons in Arizona.\n\nIn the first half of this year, six natural disasters each caused at least $1 billion damage and killed a total of 36 people. This came after 2017, the costliest year on record. It included California’s Wine Country fires, which killed 44 and destroyed 10,000 homes; Washington State blazes that dumped ash on Seattle like snow and pushed the air quality index in Spokane to “hazardous;’’ and three hurricanes – Harvey, Irma and Maria – so bad their names were retired.\n\nCLOSE An explosive wildfire closed down dozens of miles of a major California freeway. The Delta Fire erupted Wednesday afternoon and within hours devoured nearly 8 square miles on both sides of Interstate 5 near the Oregon state line. (Sept. 6) AP\n\nGlobal warming makes wildfires hotter and probably will make hurricanes bigger. And the number of people living in harm’s way, including active earthquake and volcano zones, is increasing.\n\nYet, as Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long observed this year, America lacks a \"culture of preparedness.’’\n\nWe mostly don’t stock up on batteries, candles and water; we don’t prepare a family emergency plan or buy a hand-cranked radio; we don’t listen carefully to warnings and often don’t understand them when we do.\n\nOr obey them. A survey in Florida after Hurricane Irma by Mason-Dixon polling found that only 43 percent of those under mandatory evacuation orders actually evacuated.\n\nPlumes rise where lava pours into the sea from Kilauea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii last month. The eruption has destroyed more than 700 homes. It's just one of many natural disasters grabbing Americans' attention this summer. (Photo: USGS via AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA 2015 study by the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University found that two-thirds of Americans said they were not prepared to evacuate in an emergency. But Irwin Redlener, the center’s director, believes the situation is actually worse.\n\nSometimes, when he’s speaking to groups of emergency preparedness specialists, he’ll ask how many have a personal or family evacuation plan. Only a few hands go up, and most of their plans turn out to be half-baked.\n\nRedlener thinks he knows why: It’s hard. A plan sounds like a good idea until, say, you face the question of what to do about your kids at school in case of a disaster. Do you go get them? Does your spouse? Traveling could be risky, so what are the school’s plans in an emergency? And how do you find out?\n\nSuddenly, you notice the lawn needs mowing.\n\nLast year two Wharton business school professors, Howard Kunreuther and Robert Meyer, published The Ostrich Paradox: Why We Underprepare for Disasters. They identify six unconscious biases that undercut our ability and willingness to prepare.\n\n•Myopia: We focus on the short term and have difficulty understanding long-term consequences, such as the 100-year flood.\n\n•Amnesia: We forget the past. We buy a condo in complex built where a storm once blew away a shopping center.\n\n•Inertia: We do what we’re doing until something drastic happens, when it’s too late. See New Orleans and Katrina in 2005.\n\n•Selectivity: We don’t look at all the information, or simplify to the point of inaccuracy. If we have an emergency checklist, we lose interest after covering a few items, without making sure they were the most important.\n\n•Herding: We make choices based on what the other person is doing. And so we both wind up treading water.\n\n•Optimism: This most American of traits leads us to underestimate risk, ignore worst-case scenarios and think bad things will only happen to others. It’s a great attitude for someone starting a business, not so much for someone living in a flood zone.\n\nThere are others factors, such as cost. Some people living in disaster-prone areas don’t move because they can’t afford to. Even assembling a comprehensive go-bag can be prohibitively expensive for some families.\n\nAnd there’s always sheer ignorance. Many people living along the New Jersey coast during Superstorm Sandy in 2012 had no idea what hurricanes do to barrier islands until they found their roads clogged with four feet of sand.\n\nA hard habit to change\n\nViral internet images and nonstop TV news coverage of this year’s disasters and disaster anniversaries have inspired some hope that Americans will begin to focus more on preparing for emergencies, rather than just reacting to them.\n\nBut Baker, the evacuation expert, says there’s little evidence that evacuation behavior is influenced by such things.\n\nIn 2005 he was conducting a survey of public evacuation attitudes on Long Island when Katrina struck New Orleans. He assumed that news of the disaster would ruin his study, skewing Long Islanders’ attitudes artificially and temporarily. Instead, he got the same kinds of responses after the storm as before it.\n\nHe says most people won’t change unless they’ve experienced something like a living room with 6 feet of water. But many Americans never face anything more perilous than a thunderstorm or a blizzard.\n\nA New York Times analysis this year of Small Business Administration data concluded that a relatively small part of the country has sustained most of the damage from major natural disasters; about 90 percent of the losses occurred in ZIP codes with less than 20 percent of the population.\n\nThe Wharton professors called their book \"The Ostrich Paradox\" because of a common misimpression.

I wanted to let her know I was interested in replacing Bill as undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department. At the time, I was vice-chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a global consulting firm. I already had several years of experience at State, first as assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs under former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and then as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s counselor in the 1990s.\n\nCheryl and I had some initial conversations that seemed to indicate I was being considered. Then things went silent. In Washington, interviewing for a major position is a bit of a blood sport. Reporters and pundits kick around names quite publicly, so success or failure is never a private matter. If I was going to be passed over, I wondered whether it was better that my name had fallen off the roster early. In any case, there was nothing further to be done.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSome weeks later, Cheryl called to say I was back under consideration. Would I meet her for a Sunday breakfast to discuss?\n\nWhen we met, Cheryl explained that the secretary was disposed favorably toward me but that a concern had been raised about me that I was not a team player and thus wouldn’t be a good fit. I strained to figure out where this was coming from. I thought perhaps it emanated from when I had been assistant secretary of legislative affairs, a post that required me to tell powerful people in the State Department that their priority was not the president’s and thus, they could not go up to Capitol Hill to push for their own agendas. It was hard to imagine that I’d be faulted years afterward for doing what was only my job. As we talked, however, it became clear that “not a team player” really meant “too assertive.”\n\nI was stunned. Throughout my career, I’d been called “tough.” It was a compliment that was regularly paid to women in Washington who demanded excellent work, but of course, it always sounded less begrudging when it was said of a man. In the competition for the political affairs job, “tough” had somehow become “too assertive.” Critiques like this one, along with being called “ambitious” or “aggressive,” are often lodged against women. They had been lodged against Secretary Clinton and Cheryl herself. Indeed, I was dismayed that these two very strong and powerful women believed about me the very unfair criticisms that had been pointed at them. Cheryl said she would get back to me.\n\nFinally, an evening meeting was set up at Secretary Clinton’s home in Washington. Hillary and I talked about the job itself and my ideas for how to do it, but eventually she brought up some of the same questions Cheryl had. She respected me enough to be direct with me about what she’d heard, and I answered with the same honesty, repeating what I’d told Cheryl. I left still not knowing if an offer would come.\n\nHachette Book Group\n\nIn Washington, no advocate is more valuable than the person who did the job before you, and did it well. Bill Burns, with whom I had worked closely during Bill Clinton's presidency, was one of my champions inside the department. He stepped in, telling the secretary that I would be a great team player. In the end, Secretary Clinton, with President Barack Obama’s agreement, nominated me to the post, and I became the first woman undersecretary of state for political affairs.\n\nIt was not the first time I realized what a tricky thing it is to be a powerful woman in Washington, nor was it the last. Two years later, for instance, in October 2013, I had to break the news to my Iran negotiation counterparts, known as the P5+1 and EU, that I had known about secret back-channel talks with Iran that had started in Oman months ago. This was an admission that revealed to them, and myself, that I had finally, fully assumed the mantle of U.S. power; that I was comfortable with negotiating from a place of strength and going it alone if necessary. It took the better part of a career in Washington, where calcified work structures make it so difficult for women, to learn how to be comfortable owning my own power—a necessary step if you are to wield it successfully.\n\nPower comes naturally to some people. I don’t think anyone who knew me as a teenager back in Baltimore would have picked me to be running a major nuclear arms deal 30 years later. My sister recalls me as a preteen homebody who liked to sit in her room and read.\n\nLuckily, since then, I’ve had wonderful role models who taught me how to understand power. One is my friend, former boss and business partner, Secretary Albright. Years ago, when she was serving as U.N. ambassador in the Clinton administration, Madeleine told me that the trick is not to simply wield your personal power, but to own the power of your office. Who, after all, can truly measure up to the outsize might of the United States? “When you sit across the negotiating table,” Madeleine told me, “you are the United States of America, not Wendy. If you know that and use that, it matters more than the fact that you’re a woman.” Madeleine showed me that owning that power was quite something.\n\nFormer Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, for whom I was chief of staff and then campaign manager in the 1980s, showed me one way of owning my power. Barbara doesn’t just assume a role—she transforms it by inhabiting it. Not even five feet tall and comfortably round, Barbara makes for an unlikely politician, as she acknowledged when running for the Senate in 1985. “I’m not particularly glamorous-looking,” she later told an interviewer about her difficulty measuring up to her primary opponents, Rep. Mike Barnes and Gov. Harry Hughes, also flatly stating that “I just didn’t look the part.” Barbara had no hope of growing more “senatorial,” saying, “I guess they don’t make togas in size 14 petite.”\n\nWatching Barbara over the past 40 years and more, I’ve seen that the powerful role you take on can eventually be—and should be—very close to the person you really are. You should change and grow in the role, but you can also change the way people think of the office you fill. Recalling how she was able to find her place in the male-dominated Senate in 1986 (there was only one other female senator when she arrived, Nancy Kassebaum), Barbara said her attitude was, “This is what the part looks like, and this is what the part is going to look like.\"\n\nI’ve learned a lot from men wielding their power too, and I’ve greatly admired many of them. The question of how women use their power, however, is far more complicated, more difficult and more urgent today than it is for men. Women, it must be said, have a strange relationship with power. We aren’t afraid of it necessarily, but we seem more comfortable with informal power than institutional power.\n\nEarly in my career, while organizing in local neighborhoods, I did a study with another social work student, looking at the evolution of leadership in neighborhood organizations. Most often those organizations were started by women who, in order to protect their children, wanted the city to install a traffic light at a busy intersection, or worried about safe drinking water for their families. Women got busy and got the job done, without asking whether they could do so, when they could do something for someone else. As soon as their efforts had attracted the backing of grants and donors—that is, at the point that advocacy became an organization—men invariably stepped in. Whether elected or self-appointed, men became the head of the organization once the women had built it.\n\nPerhaps this is why women are sometimes more comfortable working within a group. When I took on the job of Mikulski’s chief of staff in the House, I found solace in a group of female chiefs of staff (or “administrative assistants,” as both men and women were known then). Eleanor Lewis ran New York Rep. Gerry Ferraro’s team. Nancy LeaMond was chief of staff for Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio. Nikki Heidepriem had led efforts on behalf of women’s issues for the Democratic presidential campaign in 1984. Kitty Higgins worked for Michigan Rep. Sandy Levin.\n\nAt our monthly Chinese take-out dinners in one another's homes, we talked about common issues and brainstormed better ways to do our jobs and manage our personal lives. This bunch of seasoned political aides sustained me when I was learning the job on the fly, constantly playing catch-up and thinking sometimes that I was going to lose my mind.\n\nBut in those primitive days for women in the House, we did more than comfort one another. We proved, at least to one another, that it was possible to do our jobs and still live full lives and not go crazy. We talked one another through the rough spots and served as models for one another. It was only after I became pregnant with my daughter—I had told Barbara when she hired me that I hoped to have a child in the near future—that Nancy LeaMond felt that she could do the same. Just by being there, we established that we could be both women and chiefs of staff. In doing so, we changed one another and in ways large and small changed everyone’s expectations about working in the House.\n\nI would never give up the friendships I formed with those women. But looking back, I realize that we already had the skills to do our jobs before we started. We had the smarts to learn the ropes on our own. Women are often in denial about their own capabilities and search for others—groups of women or commanding men—to establish their power. When doing important personal work, like caring for our parents and children, the old and the young—both tasks that fall primarily to women—we are far more adept at adapting to new work and unfamiliar situations. When called on to make ends meet, we do what we must without stopping to doubt ourselves. Women excel at times when they have no choice but to take the job and do their best. Why can’t we have the same confidence in the jobs we want and like as well? We may not always have the knowledge going in, but I’d trust any woman to figure out nearly any job.\n\nGuys rarely question whether they can do the next job up. In my experience, they say yes and either worry about what they need to know later or—it’s been known to happen—not at all. There is research that indicates this isn’t just my own anecdotal observation. A widely cited internal study done by Hewlett-Packard in 2017 showed that men will apply for a job when they have 60 percent of the qualifications for the post; women will do so only when they can show that they have all of them.\n\nIt’s an open question precisely why women continue to deny their own capabilities, despite the past century of feminist activism. We know that women are still told to be quiet, and that we are still interrupted when we don’t comply. We know that men are told to push themselves forward while women are told to hang back. We worry when we are given more responsibility or more power, and too often we still believe that we don’t know enough, aren’t skilled enough, aren’t substantive enough, to do what the job we are applying for requires. When I became the assistant secretary for legislative affairs at the State Department, I’d already run a congressional representative’s office and a Senate campaign and served as executive director of both EMILY’s List and the Democratic National Committee during a national presidential campaign (Mike Dukakis’). My résumé was among the most accomplished in Washington. Yet when the job was offered to me, I was completely overwhelmed by what I didn’t know.\n\nNone of this is to say that confidence alone is enough to combat bias in fields where women are underrepresented. The field of national security and foreign policy has long been the domain of men. Although we have had three female secretaries of state, a glance at the major foreign policy publications and the panelists at major conferences will show that our security and diplomacy leaders are still predominantly men.\n\nIt is not our numbers alone that put us at a disadvantage. As undersecretary of state for political affairs, I often attended meetings in the White House Situation Room, the underground, secure conference room where senior policymakers debate the government’s way forward, often with the president in the room to finalize the decisions being made. At the time, the top positions on the National Security Council were all occupied by women, with Susan Rice as national security adviser and Avril Haines and Lisa Monaco as her deputies. These amazingly talented women, then all in their 40s, gave away nothing to male staffers in the depth of their analysis or their ability to articulate it. Yet even in this environment, men’s voices were heard differently than the women’s. As we went around the table giving our views on the topic of the day, one of the women would make a point. After one or two speakers had followed with further comments, a man at the table would inevitably repeat nearly verbatim the point made by Susan, Avril, Lisa or me. To my amazement, no one would remark that the point had already been made; rather, they would affirm their male colleague’s statement by saying, “Good point.”\n\nSoon a quiet realization dawned on us: We girls had to stick together. The women of the Situation Room developed an unspoken rule. When any man commented by repeating something that had been said earlier by a woman, one of the other women at the table would jump in. “I’m glad you agree with what ——— just said,” one of us would say about our female colleague’s identical comment, or else, “That builds nicely on the point ——— made just before.” We tried to be subtle—so subtle sometimes that I’m not convinced it always penetrated the consciousnesses of the men in the room. But we did what we could to make sure we were heard, affirmed and acknowledged, which was a wonderfully empowering experience.\n\nI try to do something similar when I do speaking engagements. After I’ve finished my prepared remarks, I customarily open the floor to questions. The first questioner is almost always a man, usually followed by another man. If by the fourth question no women have raised their hands, I stop the question period and say that I won’t continue until I hear from some of the women in the room. That brings nervous laughter, recognition and finally some raised hands from women.\n\nThe real drawback of this dynamic is that it affects how women do their jobs. When Madeleine Albright became the first female secretary of state, she understood that her first task was to assure people that she was strong enough to do the job. So she asked President Bill Clinton to nominate Strobe Talbott, Tom Pickering, Stu Eizenstat and Tim Wirth as her deputy and key undersecretaries. Rather than an admission that she needed men’s help, appointing men to these spots sent the message that she could handle, and even welcome, their strength. It must have been incredibly frustrating to constantly have to prove her ease with the role she was so clearly cut out for. For her closest staff, she hired women who could be counted on for a straightforward chat when she needed to get her thoughts in order—Elaine Shocas to be her chief of staff, with Suzy George as deputy chief of staff. Along with me as her counselor, Madeleine always had a travel companion with whom she could talk directly about her own use of power or, if needed, whether she needed to reapply her lipstick.\n\nMadeleine also had to take care to show that she was willing to fight. Not a warmonger by any stretch of the imagination, she did understand that women are perceived as hesitant to use force. As U.N. ambassador, she had burnished her credentials when she traveled with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General John Shalikashvili, to peacekeeping missions. When she became secretary, her approach to the conflict in Kosovo was so adept that Time magazine put her on the cover with the line, “Madeleine’s War.”\n\nWhen I consider how Madeleine managed to change the way we think of women in power, I see that she did it by embracing her femininity, by never falling into the trap of acting like a man to claim equality with men. Madeleine loves clothes and chooses what she wears with care. From her trademark brooches that she used to make diplomatic points to her impeccable style of dress and her love of popular culture, she didn’t allow the role of secretary of state to change the fact that she was a woman.\n\nEven working at the highest levels of government, I saw countless casual, workaday examples of the diminishment of women’s power, usually the kind dismissed as minor annoyances, the kind of jostling that can be found whenever men and women come together. As a group of us were sorting out last details on the eve of announcing the final Iran nuclear agreement in Vienna in 2015, some of the foreign ministers who had already arrived in town went to dinner with a few aides. It so happened that, because of the extraordinary composition of the P5+1 team, those of us still leading the work were mostly women. As we worked to get to closure on the last details of the agreement, text messages began to transmit back to some of us that some ministers were making derogatory jokes about how much more efficient the process would be if men were in charge. We agreed not to get distracted by the misogyny and just get the work done.\n\nOften, when women make an effort to be recognized, our demand to be valued isn’t enough—men have to validate us, as Bill Burns did for me with Secretary Clinton, or else other, more powerful women have to intervene.\n\nMore women need to stand up for each other. In many places, but especially in Washington, there is a tight cadre of guys in national security and foreign policy who recommend each other on a consistent basis for every good job that comes along. We women need to do the same for each other and insist that the boys’ network consider capable women as well when those jobs come along.\n\nMore than anything, women have to become more accustomed to getting power. And we need to recognize the power we already possess.\n\nWomen need to stop thinking that “power” is a dirty word, or that the trappings of power matter less than the work. When President Clinton and Secretary Albright asked me to come back to government as Madeleine’s counselor, I asked to be confirmed with the rank of ambassador. It was one of the smartest things I ever asked for. I knew that as a woman and without line authority, I needed some heft beyond the position, and so the Senate confirmed me as an ambassador. It has been immensely helpful. When, in that position, I led American delegations to, for instance, trilateral talks with Japan and South Korea on North Korea and all the delegations were men, being “Ambassador Sherman” undoubtedly helped when I dealt with North Korea. The title has been helpful ever since.\n\nWomen have a tremendous amount of power that comes with the roles we play in society, far more power than we ever had before. We cannot wield this power positively without understanding our strengths and owning them. At the same time, we have to appreciate that so many of the remaining obstacles to women’s advancement— most blatantly, perhaps, the sexual harassment in the workplace that has become an important topic of conversation—are all about power. We must each have the courage to stand up for what is right. We also need to rediscover the power of working collectively and become adept at using social media to speak with one voice. The challenge for many of us remains the interpersonal moments, when we have to risk being called tough, aggressive, even difficult. Our only response must be to continue to view—and use—power positively.\n\nAdapted from Not for the Faint of Heart: Lessons in Courage, Power, and Persistence by Ambassador Wendy R. Sherman.

Sake, a rice-based beverage brewed like beer but noncarbonated and higher in alcohol like wine, has been added to the state liquor code as a “vinous liquor.”\n\n“As of Aug. 8, sake will be regulated like a wine in the state of Colorado,” state department of revenue spokesman Lawrence Pacheco said. “That means that residents will be able to buy sake in winery sales rooms.”\n\nIf things go according to plan, Colorado Sake Co. will open the state’s first sake tasting room in Denver’s RiNo district in September. The business, a self-financed operation based in a 1,000-square-foot brew space behind Wine & Whey at 3559 Larimer St., was a major driver behind the law change. Now, it hopes to be at the forefront of a sake wave.\n\n“We’ve always loved sake and we wondered why don’t more people drink sake,” Heather Dennis, one of the company’s co-owners said last week as she and her partners worked to stockpile inventory in advance of the new sales rules. “We realized it was an issue with access or lack of access. That’s why we want the tasting room. To introduce and educate people.”\n\nColorado Sake Co.’s origins date back to 2016. That’s when co-founder William Stuart went to an event where he tasted sake made by Denver-based brewer Gaijin 24886.\n\n“I said, ‘I can do that,’ ” Stuart recalled. He went home, found a recipe online and kicked his roommates out of the fridge so he could ferment his creation at the requisite 50 degrees.\n\nSake has four ingredients: rice, water, yeast and koji, an Asian culinary ingredient made of steamed rice that has sprouted mold spores. Unlike beer, where yeast is added to malted grain after it cooks to produce alcohol, all the ingredients in sake brew simultaneously in a process called multiple parallel fermentation.\n\nStuart said it took him a year to master making koji. From there, he experimented until developing a sake recipe he was pleased with. In May 2017, he and his partners went to the state to get a limited winery license. They were rejected.\n\n“We were told, ‘You’re manufacturing beer and you’re selling wine,'” Stuart said.\n\nBecause of narrow definitions in the state liquor code, a rule change was needed to include and regulate sake. While it is well-known to consumers — often served hot, or in the form of a shot dropped into a beer, much to the chagrin of its advocates and aficionados — it is only produced by about 20 brewers in the Unites States today, according advocacy group the Sake Education Council.\n\nAfter being denied a license, the Colorado Sake Co. team embarked on a journey through the state lawmaking process that included talking to legislators, dealing with lobbyists and fielding questions from wineries and big-time beer makers, Stuart said. Finally, with the help of primary sponsors state Sen. Lucia Guzman, D-Denver, and Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, the change was signed into law on April 11.\n\n“Ever since the days of Hakushika Sake in Golden, sake has kind of occupied this sort of gray area in the liquor code,” said Doug Caskey, executive director of the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board, an offshoot of the state department of agriculture dedicated to marketing local wine, cider, mead and, now, sake. “It was really great we got this law changed.”\n\nHakushika Sake USA Corp., a private Japanese company, shut down in 2001, state records show.\n\nGaijin 24886 lost its space because of the new law, founder and brewer Marc Hughes said. The facility was licensed for beer production, not wine. But Gaijin is focused on the positives. It is working on finding a new location with aims to open a tasting room by next summer. In the meantime, a few varieties of Gaijin can be purchased at Divino Wine & Spirits at 1240 S. Broadway.\n\n“There is a lot of interest in experimentation with different things in town,” Hughes said of sake’s prospects in a crowded Denver liquor market. “It’s just about finding the right way to capture it.”\n\nColorado Sake Co. isn’t being distributed in liquor stores at the moment, but its flagship varieties, American Standard and the cinnamon and vanilla flavored Horchata Nigori, are on tap at Mizu Izakaya in Highland. The restaurant, at 1560 Boulder St., carries at least 50 sakes per season. Colorado Sake Co. is the only American brand it stocks.\n\n“I think that it’s just incredible that we are going to have the opportunity to get sake into more and more consumers’ hands,” Mizu beverage director Jerrica Ash said. “My goal is to make sake a spirit that in every restaurant not just in Asian restaurants.”", "clickbait": null}

But on Sunday, the once-dominant party scored its worst election result in generations. Its decline is a symptom of when liberal parties let radical-right populists dictate the political agenda.\n\nThe Social Democrats won a little over 28 percent of the vote, the most of any party but far short of giving their center-left bloc a majority. Meanwhile, the far-right Sweden Democrats won 17.6 percent of the vote in its best ever result. An exit poll showed that almost a fifth of the far-right voters cast their ballots for the Social Democrats the last election.\n\nThe result gives no party a clear route to forming a government, leaves the country politically fragmented and means that the ruling Social Democrats could potentially lose power.\n\nThe liberal party’s losses are at least partly self-inflicted. Faced with growing support for the Sweden Democrats, the Social Democrats focused much of their campaign on issues such as immigration and crime, where the far-right controls the narrative. And rather than countering the Sweden Democrats’ anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant rhetoric with a vision of their own, the liberals shifted to the right with proposals that included sending the army into neighborhoods with high crime rates.\n\n“They adopted the [Sweden Democrats’] agenda because they were afraid of losing voters,” said Ulf Bjereld, a professor at Gothenburg University and an active member of the Social Democrats.\n\n“It was a political mistake.”\n\nTT News Agency / Reuters Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Akesson gives a speech in Landskrona, Sweden, on Aug. 31, 2018.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats, which have origins in the neo-Nazi movement, have spent years telling Swedes that their country is in crisis. The party blames hordes of migrants for breaking the country’s beloved welfare state, bringing in crime and threatening Swedish identity.\n\nThat message has resonated with a growing number of people in recent years, as concerns rose over high-profile incidents of gang violence, an influx of refugees and regional economic inequality. Even some of their radical proposals and views found their way into the public debate. In June, a lawmaker’s comments that Jews and indigenous people don’t count as true Swedes received widespread attention. Similarly, the party’s proposal to only take in asylum-seekers from Nordic nations is a de facto ban on refugees that goes against Sweden’s history as one of the world’s most humanitarian nations.\n\nThe far-right party further benefited from establishment parties’ lack of attention to its rhetoric. That silence, experts say, created an information vacuum that the Sweden Democrats filled with anti-migrant, ethnonationalist views\n\n“If nobody is talking about stuff that people see as problems, the only answers and understanding that they’re going to have are the ones offered by the populist parties. That’s what you basically had in Sweden,” said Sheri Berman, a professor of politics at Barnard College.\n\nThe far-right’s claims, experts say, often did not match reality. Although Sweden has real struggles with regional inequality, social change and increasing violence, overall crime rates have dropped, the country is witnessing the highest economic growth in decades and income has increased across the board. The number of killings has risen in recent years, but there were still only 113 murders last year out of a population of nearly 10 million people, and there have been similar peaks since the government began reporting those statistics in 2002. As for Sweden Democrats’ warning of the “Islamization” of Sweden, the average Swede vastly overestimates the percentage of the population that is Muslim.\n\nWhen the Social Democrats finally did address public concerns over immigration and crime during the campaign earlier this year, the party mimicked many of the talking points and policies of the far-right. The government’s finance minister suggested refugees seek another country in which to claim asylum, while Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced that the country would crack down on criminals, and the party declared that emergency border security laws from the height of the refugee crisis would be kept in place indefinitely.\n\nBut embracing more conservative policies backfired ― support for the Social Democrats dropped even further, and one member of the Swedish parliament resigned from the party in protest.\n\n“A strategy that was tried to win back voters from the Sweden Democrats meant that the Social Democrats fell even more,” said Bjereld.\n\n“The parties who have been true to their ideological grounds ― they are the only parties who have raised in support.”\n\nJONATHAN NACKSTRAND via Getty Images Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven addresses an election campaign rally attended by Spain's prime minister in Enkoping, Sweden, on Sept. 5, 2018.\n\nThat same scenario has played out similarly in countries across Europe, where traditional left and right parties have employed similar strategies to regain voters from populist parties, largely without success.\n\n“What happens is that xenophobia, racism, anti-immigration ideas become more recognized and legitimate ... because the big parties, the power-holding parties are jumping on them,” said Emilia Palonen, an expert on populism at the University of Helsinki.\n\n“These mainstream parties should be bringing in new issues, new excitement into politics, and instead they’re following.”\n\nRather than copying the far-right’s emotional appeals toward identity and its criticism of the state, mainstream parties should offer voters fresh alternatives, Berman said.", "clickbait": null}

Of those, 3,076 are still under suppression orders that keep the details away from the public — 345 are felony criminal cases — as they work their way through the legal system, according to state computer records.\n\nUntil recently, no information about any of the suppressed cases was available publicly — not the names of the defendants, the charges they faced or even the identity of the judges who closed them — until The Post began questioning the practice.\n\nThe Post identified 66 felony cases that remained closed to the public — including homicides and sex crimes requiring registration as a sexual offender — even though the defendants had already been convicted and sentenced, some to lengthy prison terms.\n\nIn every suppressed case, The Post found, the judge’s suppression order and the reasons supporting it are shielded from public scrutiny. Courthouse employees and many law enforcement officials, including prosecutors, will not even acknowledge the suppressed cases exist, The Post found.\n\nThat means someone could be arrested, charged, convicted and sent to prison in Colorado without anyone seeing why, how or where, and whether the process was fair.\n\n“This sounds like the Star Chamber to me,” said Alan Chen, a constitutional law professor at University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law, referring to the 15th-century English court chastised for arbitrary rulings and secret proceedings. “Colorado is one of the worst states in terms of access to criminal court records for reasons I really have no explanation for. I’ve not heard of this being practiced anywhere else in the country. It’s frightening that if anything improper is going on, no one will know about it or have any way to find out.”\n\nAlthough courtrooms remain open to the public, including hearings for suppressed cases, the only way to know when a hearing is to occur is to be there when it is scheduled. A Denver Post reporter happened to attend one hearing in which a murder suspect pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and no public record of the event existed. The only way to learn the defendant’s name was to be there when the judge announced it.\n\nAccording to interviews and analysis of cases that were later opened to the public, the reasons behind a suppression order are varied: Prosecutors don’t want to alarm other members of a drug ring as they’re being rounded up; the case involves a juvenile defendant; or law enforcement says a criminal investigation is ongoing. Civil cases have been suppressed as well, typically — though not all — to shield victims of abuse or sexual assaults from publicity.\n\nBut there are other reasons as well. The Post found one criminal case — that of a board member and part-owner of the Broomfield Academy charged and convicted of felony sexual assault of a child and misdemeanor child abuse — in which prosecutors requested and received a suppression order to avoid publicity. The case remains suppressed.\n\nIt found another — of a member of the Adams County 14 school board eventually convicted with attempting to lure a child for sex — in which the judge ordered the suppression at the outset, without anyone even asking for it, because the judge “had concerns about releasing information,” records obtained by The Post show. The case remains suppressed.\n\nThe case of Clifford Galley, 28, convicted of attempted first-degree murder, was one of a number The Post found that remained suppressed long after the defendant went to prison. Galley was sentenced to 169 years in prison and won’t see freedom in his lifetime. Documents related to the case were suppressed after his arrest in 2013 and no one except for his lawyer, prosecutors or a judge could see them. Last month, a judge lifted the suppression order after The Post asked prosecutors questions about it. His appeal, however, remains suppressed.\n\nDenver Post emails to several of the judges responsible for suppressed cases went unanswered except for one, and that judge passed it along to state court administrators to respond.\n\nSuppressed cases are different than those sealed by the court, the reasons for which are limited by state law. Sealed cases are restricted to those where a defendant was exonerated or, under certain conditions, the case was dismissed, such as with a deferred sentence. Some low-level drug felonies can also be sealed under specific criteria.\n\nBy contrast, a judge may suppress a case for any reason at his or her discretion — usually, but not always, at the request of lawyers in the case, but most frequently prosecutors. Once a case is suppressed, it remains so until a judge reopens it, which The Post found often does not happen because neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors ever bother to ask.\n\n“This isn’t right; it can’t be right. It’s a chance for them to victimize our family all over again,” said Mark Chalfant, whose son, Mark, was killed in a Taco Bell parking lot in Aurora in July 2014. Four teenagers were convicted in the case — one as a juvenile — yet all the records remain closed under suppression orders three years later.\n\nHow news coverage of two high-profile sex-crime cases faded after they were suppressed by Colorado judges Douglas County sheriff’s officers had arrested one of their own — Deputy Robert “Mike” French — in the early hours of Feb. 9, 2013, on suspicion of trying to lure a 16-year-old boy into a sexual relationship. It was a Saturday and French, then 41, was taken to the Douglas County Detention Facility at about 3:30 a.m. He was kept there until he was to appear before a judge two days later. On Monday morning, before any word that French had been arrested was made public, Senior Deputy District Attorney Jay Williford asked a judge to suppress the case and all the information surrounding French’s arrest and the crimes he was accused of committing, court records show. The judge agreed. Continue reading\n\nAlthough media attention about the shooting and the arrests was widespread, the court cases were immediately suppressed. Only the 30-year sentence of triggerman Sterling Hook made a headline in a local newspaper a year later — after prosecutors released the information.\n\n“No one else ever gets to know what they’ve done,” Chalfant said, noting that no one other than family attended court hearings spread over a year. “That’s just wrong.“\n\nCourt records “critically important”\n\nOpen-records experts and several attorneys interviewed by The Post were troubled by the newspaper’s findings, saying it runs against the Colorado and U.S. constitutions and their guarantee of an open and accessible court system.\n\n“Court records in general are a critically important source of information for the public,” said Jeff Roberts, executive director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. “Without access to court records and proceedings, Coloradans can’t monitor the judicial system. They can’t know whether it’s working properly or not.”\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court in June refused to declare that access to court records is an absolute right guaranteed by the First Amendment or the Colorado Constitution. But that decision dealt with a specific document that had been sealed within a court file, not the entire case itself or its details.\n\nThe Post’s investigation also found:\n\n— Most suppressed cases had scant or no media attention, and the majority of the few that did were typically at the time of a defendant’s arrest, before anything was suppressed by a judge. Several suppressed cases did get press coverage when charges were filed and again after a defendant was sentenced, when prosecutors issued an announcement — but nothing in between.\n\n— Until recently, no trace of a suppressed case existed in the public-access computers the state provides at county courthouses throughout Colorado, or the online for-pay services that compile the same data and the state recommends to the public. That has changed since The Post began inquiring. Until last week, the public still could not see what charges had been brought against a person in a suppressed case or see any details about it, such as the next court hearing or any sentence given.\n\n— Sealed cases are restricted by law to only the judge who issued the order, and acknowledging their existence is prohibited. Public information about suppressed cases, however, per Colorado Supreme Court rule, should include names and case numbers, though the details of a case and the courtroom proceedings around it have been restricted. Despite that, court officials and some prosecutors’ offices still treat the two types of cases as the same and refuse to give any information about a suppressed case.\n\n— Public schedules posted daily outside of courtrooms, called dockets, show the cases being heard that day, including the names of defendants. If the case is suppressed, however, the docket only shows that a time is allotted for a hearing, but not why or for whom.\n\n— Even high-profile cases that received intense publicity are under suppression orders, meaning access to any of their court records today is prohibited. Among them: Aurora theater shooter James Holmes; witness killers Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray; and Jessica Ridgeway killer Austin Sigg. The media was able to follow these cases by appearing at a public court hearing to learn when the next was to be held. Many times prosecutors and defense lawyers say they simply forgot the case was still suppressed.\n\n“That’s very troubling”\n\nThe Denver Post began investigating suppressed cases in Colorado nearly a year ago after reporters were denied access to records and expressed concern about the practice. The Post obtained data from the State Court Administrator that helped it determine the extent to which suppressions have been used in each judicial district in Colorado. The Post then reviewed dozens of suppressed cases that have been unsuppressed to see how the practice was being used.\n\nSince 2013, there have been 6,707 cases suppressed by judges in Colorado, and the bulk of them were criminal cases, The Post found — misdemeanors first, then felonies, followed by civil court matters. A judge’s suppression order was lifted in 3,631 of them, meaning the public can now access the cases, sometimes soon after a defendant was arrested or parties to a civil lawsuit were served with court papers, records show.\n\n“Generally it’s one thing to suppress a (single) document, which is very legitimate, but when entire files begin to disappear from the public record, that’s very troubling,” Denver attorney Larry Pozner said. “We’re very skeptical in America of things done in the dark, and other than juvenile law, you can walk into an American courtroom and take notes, and they can’t say, ‘It’s none of your business, get out of here.’ ”\n\nThe Post’s analysis found that the number of suppressed cases varies dramatically from county to county. Prosecutors in La Plata County, where Durango is the county seat, have suppressed 366 felony cases over the past five years, the most by any jurisdiction, records show. But those cases were nearly always unsuppressed once a defendant was arrested and brought to court, the longest taking two years, The Post found.\n\n“It’s not uncommon to suppress a case until the defendant is arrested and the warrant served,” said Christian Champagne, district attorney for Colorado’s Sixth Judicial District that includes La Plata, Archuleta and San Juan counties. “Ours is an area where people come through and leave for long stretches of time.”\n\nIn the 18th Judicial District, which is made up of Arapahoe, Douglas, Lincoln and Elbert counties, 62 cases are still suppressed from public view even though the defendants have been tried, convicted and sentenced, The Post found, the highest among the state’s 22 judicial districts. The majority of the cases — 47, most of them from a single drug-conspiracy investigation from four years ago — are in Arapahoe County, followed by 14 others in Douglas County, and one in Elbert County.\n\nThat total doesn’t include 115 active felony cases that are still under suppression in the district — nearly half the statewide total, The Post found.\n\n“I still think there are some legitimate reasons on behalf of the safety of certain victims and witnesses … that we ought to have the ability to continue to suppress those,” 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler said.\n\nIn 2015, prosecutors asked that the Douglas County sex-assault case against Broomfield Academy then-owner and board member Michael Greenberg, 62, be suppressed because it likely would garner a lot of media attention. A television station reported his arrest. There was no media report after the suppression order was issued. The private school is to close this year, according to its website.\n\nThe case has remained suppressed ever since even though Greenberg pleaded guilty to felony sexual assault of a child in which he received a four-year deferred sentence, and to a misdemeanor charge of child abuse. He is a registered sex-offender in Centennial, records show. Following The Post’s inquiry, prosecutors have asked a judge to unsuppress the case.\n\n“Our office filed a motion to suppress, the reason being is that the case would be subject to extensive pretrial publicity,” Brauchler’s Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Rich Orman told The Post in an email, saying he and Brauchler were not consulted by the DA who handled the case. “This was a mistake, and we should not have sought suppression of a court file for this reason.”\n\nBrauchler said suppression orders sometimes are important to solving serious crimes, but concedes that once their usefulness is over, cases should not remain hidden from public scrutiny.\n\n“Already in many cases, specifically gang and some domestic violence cases, the concern over an individual’s own safety is so strong that if you can’t provide some other assurance, even in the short-term, I think we’ll lose out on cooperation from a lot of key witnesses,” Brauchler said. “But the public should maintain the ability to scrutinize what we do, why we do it and how we go about that.”\n\nAfter speaking with The Post, Brauchler’s office began unsuppressing many of the cases and instituted policies limiting how the practice should be used in the future. There are some cases, however, that Brauchler said should remain suppressed for the safety of the defendant — one of whom is serving a 16-year prison term in a rural county jail after having testified against another defendant who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, records show.\n\nThere have been no suppressed cases involving a criminal defendant in Denver District Court the past five years, the years The Post reviewed, according to records.\n\n“This is just a completely foreign procedure in my years of experience as a district attorney,” said former Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey. “In my 33 years, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never even heard of suppressing an entire case. How can you have cases that don’t even show up on a court docket? I’ve never seen such a thing.”\n\nExperts in open-records law say the practice of suppressing entire cases rubs against the grain of a system intended to be transparent.\n\n“The most outrageous, unjustifiable and unconstitutional thing you’ve found is the public being denied the right to know which cases are on file in our courts of law against which defendants, and to have access, at the minimum, to the indexes of those cases,” said Denver attorney Steven Zansberg, an expert on open-records laws who represents a number of media outlets including The Denver Post.\n\n“How is there a case where the public doesn’t know how or why someone is arrested or in prison?” he asked. “Courts throughout the land have held the public — we the people — have a constitutional First Amendment right to have access to those records.”\n\nMany cases suppressed\n\nWhen Frank Huner Jr., a 58-year-old Sedalia man, was charged in July 2017 with first-degree murder for allegedly killing his son, whom he said he mistook for an intruder, news of his arrest peppered the media.\n\nSince then, however, there’s been not a word about the Douglas County case — and not a single reference to it could be found anywhere among the state’s courthouse databases available for the public to search criminal and civil cases. Courthouse employees refused to identify the case even existed.\n\nDuring the course of The Post’s investigation, the State Court Administrator has changed the computer programs that provide the public with information about criminal and civil cases so that a defendant’s name, case number and the county where the case is being heard is displayed.\n\nUntil a week ago the public could not see the charges they faced or details about a suppressed case’s progress through the judicial system.\n\nSuch is the case of Daniel Pesch, a 34-year-old Littleton man charged in December 2017 for the 2010 murder of Kiowa High School science teacher Randy Wilson. The case has been suppressed since the moment it was filed, even though the media covered Pesch’s arrest. It’s only been recently unsuppressed after dozens of hearings. Still, several key portions of the case remain concealed from public view.\n\nAs well with Jeffrey Falk, 54, a former ThunderRidge High School math teacher sentenced in June 2016 to 21 years in prison for victimizing young boys and collecting “a library of child porn.” He had pleaded guilty in Arapahoe County district court to three counts of sexual exploitation of a child two months earlier.\n\nHis arrest in 2015 made headlines, but the four cases against him were immediately suppressed until he was sentenced. No other stories were published until after he pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and prosecutors later made a public announcement in June 2016.\n\nOne of the four cases against Falk was unsuppressed a month after that, records show — but the other three felony cases for which he was sentenced remained closed. That changed on June 13 after The Post began asking why.\n\nThe first-degree murder case in Adams County against juvenile Aidan Zellmer remains suppressed even though a judge has already ruled the 15-year-old is to stand trial as an adult.\n\nAnd despite media coverage about the case, the warrant affidavit that describes the evidence that led to Zellmer’s arrest remains suppressed, as well as any other information about the case against him.\n\nEven when a defendant has been charged, convicted and sent to prison, if the case is suppressed, some district attorney’s offices still treat it as if the matter has been sealed, even though the two are very different.\n\n“The short answer is that suppressed and sealed means the same thing to the extent the public is barred from access,” Denver district attorney’s office spokesman Ken Lane told The Post when asked to provide information about a suppressed case from 2013 in which Denver was the special prosecutor in a different county. “So, if whatever case you’re referring to is in fact suppressed by a court order, then respectfully, I’m not going to violate a court order and release case information to the public.”", "clickbait": null}

The Torah is the central holy text in Judaism. (Photo: Hannah Gaber/The Republic)\n\nEach year, 163 days after Passover, the Jewish community celebrates Rosh Hashana, which marks the beginning of the High Holy Days leading up to Yom Kippur.\n\nThe two-day celebration of Rosh Hashana began this year at sundown Sunday and will continue through Tuesday night.\n\nThe phrase means “head of the year.\" But the holiday actually takes place in the seventh month of the Jewish calendar (the months don't exactly line up to a traditional Gregorian calendar, but the seventh month usually takes place in September and October).\n\nThe celebration is actually considered the birth or creation of the world, rather than marking the passage of a year around the sun. According to Orthodox tradition, Rosh Hashana, which also is spelled Rosh Hashanah, is the anniversary of when the breath of life entered lumps of clay and created Adam and Eve.\n\nIn other words, the Jewish holiday celebrates the creation of humanity.\n\nSeptember 2017: What is Yom Kippur? How do Jews observe it?\n\nSeptember 2017: When is Rosh Hashanah 2017 and what are Jews celebrating?\n\nThose attending synagogue services will hear the sound of a ram's horn being blown. In all, the ceremonial horn (called a shofar) is blown 100 times. The first trumpeting of the shofar starts a 10-day period known as the \"days of awe\" through Yom Kippur, which is the \"day of atonement.\" This year, Yom Kippur begins on the evening of Sept. 18 and ends the evening of Sept. 19.\n\nAn ultra-Orthodox Jew performs a Jewish ritual called 'Kaparot,' performed before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement and the holiest of Jewish holidays, in Beit Shemesh, Israel, on Sept. 28, 2017. The Kaparot is a blessing and prayer recited as a live fowl, or chicken is passed over a person's head, symbolically transferring that person's sins accumulated over the past year into the bird, which is butchered and eaten or donated to charity. (Photo: ABIR SULTAN, EPA-EFE)\n\nDuring this time, Jews believe the Book of Life is opened, and God writes down what their upcoming year will hold. Over the 10 days, believers seek forgiveness and try to make amends for wrongs against God or other people.\n\nOn the 10th day, according to Jewish belief, God closes the book, sealing the future in stone for the year. This 10th day, known as Yom Kippur, is when observant Jews fast for about 24 hours. The fast is broken when the shofar blows again.\n\nContributing: Ali Phillips and Hannah Gaber, The Arizona Republic.

The first 1,000 shoppers get a free reusable bag.\n\nIt remains to be seen if that event will generate the same kind of fervor H&M did. After all, Target is well known in Colorado, having operated stores here for decades. It’s got brand recognition but isn’t trendy or new like its Scandinavian counterpart.\n\nRegardless of how many people line up before the new store’s doors are flung open at 1600 California St., downtown business advocates are ecstatic over its arrival and what it says about the economic vitality of a portion of Denver sporting a retail vacancy rate of 3.3 percent.\n\n“When Target chooses to locate somewhere they are sending a message that the customer base is there,” Downtown Denver Partnership CEO Tami Door said Monday. “This shows this brand has identified the center city of Denver — and it sends this message to other brands — as a place where they believe they will be successful.”\n\nThe 16th Street Mall store won’t be just any Target. At 30,000 square feet, it’s less than quarter the size of the retailer’s average store. It will feature a curated collection of goods designed to appeal to downtown shoppers, Ashlee Justis, the store’s team lead, said.\n\nOn its main floor, the second floor of the 1600 California St. building, shoppers will find clothes and accessories — including Broncos and other local team gear — and an electronics and entertainment department complete with cellphones that can be activated on the spot. There will be a grocery section with fresh produce and frozen goods, as well as grab-and-go items such as sandwiches, meant to cater to customers popping in and out on their lunch breaks.\n\nFloor two will carry cosmetics and personal care products and travel goods — again catering to a specific downtown market segment: tourists. There will also be an assortment of home wares and decor, a category H&M added to its 16th Street Mall store in 2015.\n\n“Why this is going to be so exciting, especially for the downtown Denver guest, is this store is created especially for them,” Justis said. “It’s going to be a quick, convenient spot to get those products you have relied on Target for traditionally.”\n\nDoubling down on the convenience, the store will have a CVS pharmacy and self-checkout kiosks. It will also serve as the order pickup point for people who buy from Target.com, company officials say. Place an order on the website, and within an hour that item will be ready at the store.\n\nThe store is an example of Target’s real estate evolution. After going from big to jumbo in the form of its Super Target store formats, the company is now going small. When the 16th Street Mall store opens it will be one of 71 small format stores the retailer has opened across the country. Meant to fit in denser urban centers or near college campuses, the smaller footprint allows Target close places it hasn’t been before, such as downtown Denver, company spokeswoman Jacqueline DeBuse said.\n\n“We’ve always been interested in the (downtown) Denver community,” DeBuse said. “We know there are daytime professionals and round-the-clock residents.”\n\nDeBuse’s reference to round-the-clock residents offers a potential clue as to why it has taken Target so long to hit its mark downtown. The Downtown Denver Partnership’s CEO Door said her organization has been working on bringing the brand to the city’s urban core for decades. Every time an opportunity came up, some factor dragged it down, whether the location or property owner wasn’t the right fit, or Target not being in an expansion mode at the time, or the demographics not being strong enough.\n\n“When you’re working to attract a retail location, everything has to be right,” she said.\n\nIn downtown Denver today — defined by the partnership as the area made up of the Auraria, Lower Downtown, Ballpark, Central Platte Valley, Golden Triangle and Center Business District neighborhoods — more people are working, visiting and living than ever before. Randy Thelen, the partnership’s vice president of economic development, said 23,000 people live downtown, three times as many as 2000. The area’s 136,000 employees is an all-time high. Add that in with a $4 million tax incentive package from the Denver City Council, and the “Why now, Target?” question answers itself.", "clickbait": null}

It’s also become an official White House position, after the communications office distributed talking points last week to outside surrogates titled “Big Tech is Suppressing Conservative Voices.”\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe talking points, which were obtained by POLITICO, highlight a New York Times story about Facebook employees alleging on an internal message board that the company is “intolerant” of perspectives that differ with its left-leaning culture. The talking points also target Twitter for discriminating against Republicans by limiting users’ ability to find them in searches, and Google for showing the word “Nazism” next to search results for the California Republican Party.\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe tech companies have repeatedly rejected the idea that their platforms are intentionally biased. They argue that in cases where partisan leanings are detected in their algorithms, design choices or enforcement decisions, they are quickly fixed. The supposed record of bias, their defenders argue, is hugely anecdotal.\n\nBut conservatives have in recent years repeatedly pointed to signs that the tech industry’s liberal leanings are manifested in the tools it has built, typified by so-called shadow banning, or quiet suppression, of Republican activity on the social-media platforms.\n\nThe president’s embrace of anti-Silicon Valley rhetoric has been shaped by advisers who see it as the latest front in the country’s long-running culture wars and believe it has the potential to rally conservative voters ahead of the midterms and the president’s own reelection campaign in 2020. They include Brad Parscale, the manager of Trump’s reelection campaign; Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son; Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel; and Fox News personalities Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson.\n\nIn May, Parscale and McDaniel wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey demanding an end to “bias against conservative content.” Parscale and McDaniel met with Facebook executives in June alongside House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who conservatives see as another major conduit between the tech companies and the president.\n\nThe California Republican helped popularize the hashtag #StopTheBias, which has been picked up by Trump and top surrogates like Trump Jr. McCarthy has had several conversations with the president about social media bias, using personal anecdotes and examples of the companies' slanted treatment against conservatives to drive home his point, according to a Republican with knowledge of their discussions.\n\n“Conservatives invested a lot of money in building up their Facebook presences, and they did really well for a while,” Zach Graves, head of policy at the San Francisco-based right-of-center tech advocacy group Lincoln Network, told POLITICO. “Then Facebook changed the algorithm, and engagement dropped off a cliff. Now they’re practically worthless.”\n\nConservative allies of the White House have publicly suggested a range of policy remedies, including imposing government oversight of the tech sector by treating companies like public utilities. Another option being discussed informally in conservative circles: a push to eliminate tech companies’ protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits firms like Google’s liability for the content hosted on their platforms.\n\nRumors have circulated in Washington in recent days that the White House is workshopping ideas for a Google-targeting executive order. Several people inside the White House denied working on such a project.\n\nThe roots of conservative suspicions about social media can be traced back to a May 2016 report by the tech publication Gizmodo in which an unnamed Facebook source said the site’s in-house curators “routinely suppressed conservative news” in its trending news section. Coming at the height of the fraught U.S. presidential primaries — Trump was in the final weeks of sewing up the Republican nomination — the debate quickly became highly politically charged.\n\nThe president, who tweets avidly but doesn’t use a computer or consume social media himself, has repeatedly tweeted about his frustrations with tech companies, accusing Google of rigging search results to show only stories from the “Fake News Media” and Twitter “shadow banning” prominent Republicans.\n\n“[V]irtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,” Trump said in a Tuesday interview with the Daily Caller, accusing tech firms of interfering in the 2016 and 2018 elections.\n\nThe Justice Department signaled this week that it is taking the president’s concerns seriously. In a Wednesday statement, the department announced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is organizing a meeting, slated for Sept. 25, with state attorneys general “to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.”\n\nIn response to a Trump tweet criticizing Google last week, Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser, said the administration is even “taking a look” at imposing regulations on the internet giant, sending shock waves through the tech world as it scrambled to figure out what such a move might look like.\n\nTrump later appeared to walk back Kudlow’s comments, saying he wants “fairness,” not regulation — and White House officials declined to detail any policy other policy responses that are in the works. Current and former administration officials said they are often unsure whether the president’s Twitter pronouncements — from threatening to take away NBC News' license to looking into South Africa’s land policies — should be taken seriously and followed up with a suite of policy options.\n\n“Many of us operated on the assumption that this kind of stuff is just a PR, messaging ploy,” one former administration official said.\n\nDuring a Wednesday House hearing on the topic, Dorsey testified that while “we recognize that even a model created without deliberate bias may nevertheless result in biased outcomes,” as a company, “we believe strongly in being impartial, and we strive to enforce our rules impartially.”\n\nRepublicans, though, kept up their criticisms of the social network throughout the course of the hearing. Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana highlighted what he called examples of Twitter practices that seem to have “selectively adversely affected conservatives” — including an October 2017 campaign ad from Republican Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn that was temporarily rejected by the company over its mentions of abortion.\n\nThe following day, Twitter moved to permanently suspend provocateur Alex Jones and his far-right InfoWars, citing tweets and videos that violate its abusive behavior policy.\n\nSome close to Trump have started to worry that the president will undercut efforts to address the problems tech companies have already acknowledged by embracing some of the conspiracy-theory-laden elements of conservatives’ allegations against tech companies. One source close to the White House argued that Trump didn’t help his cause by tweeting out a video that falsely claimed Google didn’t promote his State of the Union addresses the way it promoted former President Barack Obama’s.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's critics see considerable irony in the fact that Twitter's most powerful user is complaining about bias when it has long been his preferred venue to tend to his grievances before an audience of more than 50 million.\n\nDemocrats dismiss Trump’s embrace of the attacks on major tech companies as politically motivated. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, accused Trump on Wednesday of peddling “conspiracy theories about Twitter and other social media platforms to whip up their base and fundraise.”\n\n", "clickbait": null}

Ocasio-Cortez, a Latina woman, and Pressley, a black woman, both defeated long-time incumbents of U.S. Congress seats in New York and Massachusetts; Gillum, a black man, won the open primary in Florida’s governor race.\n\nNixon, a first-time candidate without governing experience, is known for her years starring on HBO’s “Sex and the City,” set in New York. She is hoping to repeat the success of other less-heralded names in Thursday’s nominating contest against Cuomo, who is seeking a third term.\n\n“People keep underestimating insurgent candidates, particularly first-time candidates,” said Nixon, who is running antagonistically to Cuomo’s left.\n\nNixon’s opposition mirrors those of others who argue Democrats nationwide have been far too cautious in embracing progressive proposals, wary of alienating more moderate voters.\n\nOcasio-Cortez’s victory in June’s nominating race over 10-term U.S. Representative Joe Crowley sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party. The Republican Party controls both the House of Representatives and the Senate and the Nov. 6 congressional elections will determine whether they keep their majorities.\n\nNominating contests are hard to poll, and while those other races went against incumbents, lower-profile candidates do not always succeed: Joe Manchin and Tom Carper, incumbent U.S. Democratic senators in West Virginia and Delaware, both defeated challengers from the left.\n\nNixon, 52, has lagged more than 30 points behind Cuomo in opinion polls, and he has outraised her nearly 50 times over, though far more of Nixon’s support comes from small donors.\n\nShe says Cuomo, 60, the son of a former governor, is out of touch with the party’s diverse ranks, and too aligned with conservative Republicans and moneyed corporations to be running one of the country’s most liberal states. Cuomo is one of 16 Democratic governors nationwide. There are 33 Republicans and one independent.\n\nCuomo has talked more about U.S. President Donald Trump on the campaign and his aides have derided Nixon as a talented but unqualified actress.\n\nCynthia Nixon speaks during the Democratic gubernatorial primary debate with Cynthia Nixon at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York August 29, 2018. J. Conrad Williams Jr./Pool via REUTERS\n\nCuomo has drawn the ire of some voters, angered that he for years allowed several Democratic members of the state’s senate to caucus with Republicans to give that party the advantage in the statehouse.\n\nCuomo counters that he has a record of passing same-sex marriage and paid family leave in New York state. The winner on Thursday faces Republican Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, in November.\n\nNixon’s distrust is shared by supporters such as Zakiyah Ansari, who stood by Nixon as she canvassed outside her childhood elementary school on Manhattan’s Upper West Side on Friday morning, hyping her up to passersby.\n\n“They don’t poll people like me,” said Ansari, a director at New York’s Alliance for Quality Education, a public school advocacy group where Nixon has been a spokeswoman for 17 years. “I don’t believe they call us, black and brown folks, poor people.”\n\nBoth Cuomo and newspaper editorial boards have criticized Nixon’s lack of management experience and cast her proposals, particularly her plan for state universal health care, as fantastically expensive. Nixon has been vague on funding beyond saying there are plenty of rich people in New York to tax.\n\nAt the school, Nixon stood on the sidewalk where parents and children were filing by, her right hand floating out before her, sometimes ignored by passersby but more often shaken as people recognized her face.\n\n“‘Sex and the City’ got me through college!” Brittany James, a 34-year-old teacher, told Nixon. “You’ve got my vote.”\n\nShabd Simon-Alexander, a 37-year-old political organizer from Brooklyn, said Nixon had proved her worth as a political activist, and her platform could turn out new voters.\n\n“All you need is people in the street, knocking on doors, going to vote,” Simon-Alexander said.\n\nNixon acknowledged her celebrity has drawn more attention than most first-time candidates, but, she said, “What gets them on board is the issues that I’m talking about.”\n\nLater at a fundraiser in a dark, expensive bar in the Meatpacking District, a neighborhood used as a backdrop on “Sex and the City,” Nixon said: “We are taking the Democratic Party back,” the crowd cheering at just the mention of three names: Ocasio-Cortez, Gillum, Pressley. “It’s happening,” she said.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)", "clickbait": null}

The president is amoral, Anonymous wrote. He’s anti-democratic. He’s impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective. He flip-flops. He can’t stay on topic and is given to repetitive rants. He’s unstable, says the piece, whose headline and dek tell the story: “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration: I work for the president but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnonymous, perhaps the deepest Deep Throat since Watergate, continues: He’s only one member of the Trump administration’s internal resistance—he and others monkey-wrenched the White House operation to “do what’s right when Donald Trump won’t.” That’s not news, either, as the press has charted the foot-draggers in the administration. Just Tuesday, we learned from Bob Woodward’s anonymously sourced new book, Fear: Trump in the White House, that aides have pilfered papers from the president’s desk to prevent him from signing them. But the Times’ anonymous op-ed writer makes the case that there’s an ongoing insurrection within the administration. If true, that means 1) Donald Trump, our elected president, isn’t in control of his own team and 2) that the show is being run by anonymous bureaucrats who, depending on how you look at it, are self-anointed patriots or traitors. (We know where the president stands: As I filed this, Trump tweeted simply: “TREASON?”)\n\nThe op-ed sent Washington ass-over-applecart because it breaks with the Washington tradition that holds that the accepted way for a government whistleblower to undermine an administration is to leak information to the press (Mark Felt, the original Deep Throat), pilfer documents (Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers), or make themselves visible and resign in protest (Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William D. Ruckelshaus in Watergate’s Saturday Night Massacre) and join the opposition. For somebody with the paranoiac tendencies of Donald Trump, the op-ed has got to look like something worse than the “deep state” he’s always harping about. It’s like a silent coup.\n\nIt goes without saying that the president and his muscle will tear the plasterboard off the West Wing to unmask and punish Anonymous and his confreres. But seeing as Anonymous’ identity is news, the press hounds will be baying, too. Ordinarily, reporters avoid exposing the anonymous sources of other reporters because they don’t want to set a precedent that will result in their sources getting outed.\n\nThe rare violation of this mutually assured destruction pact came after Watergate, when everybody and their brother tried to identify the original Deep Throat, Bob Woodward’s secret source in All the President’s Men. Once in the early 1980s, when Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen came close to correctly naming Mark Felt as the mysterious source, Woodward did everything he could do to wave him off. “It’s not him, I said, adopting the well-tested Watergate strategy that when all else fails, lie,” Woodward confesses in his 2005 book, The Secret Man. “Cohen didn’t do the column.”\n\nThe New York Times did the right thing in publishing Anonymous because the “first duty of the press “is to obtain the correct intelligence of the events of the time, and instantly, by disclosing them, to make them the common property of the nation.” But having posited the ongoing conspiracy against the president, he can’t expect the press—maybe not even reporters on the news side of the New York Times—to protect his identity. He’s not an anonymous source for a journalist; he’s an anonymous author publishing his work.\n\nThis puts him in a separate, more vulnerable category. He’s less like Deep Throat and more like journalist Joe Klein, the anonymous author of the best-selling novel Primary Colors, or Michael Scheuer, the CIA officer turned anonymous author of 2003’s Through Our Enemies’ Eyes and 2004’s Imperial Hubris. Journalists suffered no compunctions about revealing the identities of both authors, and they will work as hard as Trump to uncover him. Don’t feel bad for Anonymous: In Washington, such acts of subterfuge are automatically rewarded with big book contracts.\n\nTrump’s response to the op-ed was predictably loopy, helping to make its case that the president wallows in a world of delusion. He rushed onto TV to recite the economic accomplishments of his administration and denounce the New York Times and other outlets as “phony.” Somewhere, the Resistance that Anonymous helps lead was busy sharpening its pencils and shredding documents they don’t want the president to sign.

First, what is and is not forgivable?... https://t.co/NQQpoO9kPa — Sterling K Brown (@SterlingKBrown) September 9, 2018\n\nThe actor’s words concern the objections Munn raised about the hiring of Steven Wilder Striegel to appear in a scene in the film. Striegel is a registered sex offender and served six months in prison after pleading guilty to allegations that he exchanged inappropriate emails with a 14-year-old girl.\n\nMunn insisted his scene be cut for the film, saying that neither she nor her castmates were told about Striegel’s criminal background. The scene was cut. But Munn told Vanity Fair that the backlash she’s gotten for being vocal about Striegel has made her “kind of feel like I’m the one going to jail.”\n\n“I didn’t go to jail, I didn’t put this guy on our set. I had this scene deleted. Thank God, honestly, that there is social media. It’s the fans and news outlets that’s confirming it to me that what I did was the right thing,” she told the publication.\n\n“If I didn’t have that feedback, I’d kind of go a little crazy thinking, ‘Why am I being treated like this?’ That’s not OK, to feel like the bad guy.”\n\nMunn’s co-stars Boyd Holbrook, Thomas Jane, Trevante Rhodes, and Keegan- Michael Key had declined to give public statements addressing Striegel controversy. The actress told Vanity Fair that one co-star even left an interview when the topic came up.\n\nDirector Shane Black was aware of Striegel’s crime, but last week said he only recently learned new details about it. “It has sadly become clear to me that I was misled by a friend I really wanted to believe was telling me the truth when he described the circumstances of his conviction,” Black said in a statement. “I believe strongly in giving people second chances ― but sometimes you discover that chance is not as warranted as you may have hoped.”\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter’s Video Lounge at the Toronto International Film Festival on Saturday, Munn sat alongside just one fellow castmate ― 11-year-old Jacob Tremblay ― and talked about how “lonely” it is to have been the one to say something about Striegel.\n\nRich Polk via Getty Images\n\n“I do feel like I’ve been treated by some people like I’m the one who went to jail or I’m the one who put this guy on our set,” Munn said.\n\n“When I’m being asked about it, I don’t know how to lie about it. … It’s a very lonely feeling to be sitting here by myself when I should be here with the rest of the cast.”\n\nBrown’s tweets in support of Munn addressed the idea of redemption in the age of the Me Too movement and also the importance of directors providing their cast with necessary information.\n\n“We all have the right to know who we’re working with! And when someone has been convicted of a crime of a sexual nature involving a child, we have the right to say it’s not okay! Our studio was not given that opportunity, and neither was our cast,” Brown said.\n\n“Especially [Olivia Munn] who was the only member of the principal cast who had to work with him. I so appreciate that you ‘didn’t leave well enough alone,’ & again, I’m sorry you feel isolated in taking action.”\n\nOur studio was not given that opportunity, and neither was our cast. Especially @oliviamunn who was the only member of the principal cast who had to work with him. I so appreciate that you “didn’t leave well enough alone,” & again, I’m sorry you feel isolated in taking action. — Sterling K Brown (@SterlingKBrown) September 9, 2018\n\nBrown then thanked the studio for cutting the scene and told Munn: “I hope you don’t feel quite so alone. You did the right thing.”\n\nKey’s representative responded to the controversy in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday, defending the actor’s absence from the discussion with Munn and Tremblay: “His last interview was scheduled after lunch, which he completed. He was always departing (the festival) early so he could be home to spend the Jewish holiday with his wife. Furthermore, Keegan reached out to Olivia privately last week to let her know how proud he was of her and echoed that sentiment in many interviews since then.”\n\nMunn doubled down her beliefs on social media, tweeting on Thursday, “The #MeToo movement called out abusers. But they’re not the only ones in the wrong.”\n\nThe #MeToo movement called out abusers. But they’re not the only ones in the wrong. Those who know about abuse and not only do nothing but continue to put abusers in positions of power are complicit. https://t.co/QngLCk9fzj — om (@oliviamunn) September 6, 2018\n\nMunn tweeted that the only reason she’s still doing press for the film is that she’s “contractually obligated.”\n\n“From what I’m experiencing, I think they’d prefer I not show up. It would make everyone breathe easier. Also, I worked really hard on this film, as did the rest of the cast and crew. Now that the scene is deleted I think audiences will love it.”\n\nMunn also tweeted that her mother taught her to stand up and say ”‘That’s not okay’ Even if you find yourself standing alone, speak up.”", "clickbait": null}

But Democratic super PACs are playing a bigger role than ever in the party.\n\nThe super PACs charged with helping Democrats take back the House and Senate are raking in record sums from donors motivated by opposition to President Donald Trump, even as a rising class of candidates — like Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke and Ayanna Pressley, who scored a primary upset over Rep. Mike Capuano in Massachusetts last week — are rejecting corporate PAC money and using campaign finance as a purity test against entrenched opponents. Meanwhile, the Democratic super PACs are using their new cash reserves to take over more and more of the party’s core functions, expanding from a focus on TV advertising to run major field programs and digital campaigns.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe current system has created an ongoing, awkward dance in which Democratic candidates are calling for change while benefiting from an increasingly large flow of outside money seeking to match Republican spending. In the recent special election in Ohio’s 12th District, Democrat Danny O’Connor rejected taking money from corporate PACs and pledged to change campaign finance laws if elected — as he benefited from more than a million dollars in outside spending praising him or attacking his opponent.\n\nDemocratic operatives have concluded their super PAC buildup is necessary, especially after searching for new strategies in the wake of the 2016 loss.\n\n\"For the last cycle leading into [this] election, every day is Groundhog Day, reliving a very tough election night,” said J.B. Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC, the main super PAC aligned with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “I experienced every meeting with activists, with organizers, with donors as the same conversation. Everybody wants to know how to do it different. People are eager to succeed.”\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAltogether, the four biggest Democratic super PACs have disclosed raising close to $150 million so far during the election cycle — more than double the $60 million the same groups had raised at approximately this point during the last midterm elections. Affiliated nonprofits have meanwhile raised tens of millions more from secret donors riled by Trump’s presidency.\n\nThose funds are going towards a range of new strategic investments that, super PAC operators like Poersch hope, will help Democrats win back the House and Senate. Majority Forward — the 501(c)(4) nonprofit linked to Senate Majority PAC — is spending $20 million to turn out voters in traditionally red states like Tennessee ahead of the midterms this year, while Priorities USA, the formerly presidential-focused group that went dormant during the last midterm election, has a 40-person digital advertising program ahead.\n\n“There is a lot of friendly competition to be relevant by providing more services than just carpet-bombing your opponent by television,” said one Democratic consultant who works on congressional races. “It’s not in vogue to say to your billionaire potential donor, ‘I’m going to beat the shit out of Republicans with the money you give me.’”\n\nNo pivot was bigger than the one performed by Priorities USA, the main super PAC that supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and former President Barack Obama in 2012. After watching Democrats be outspent 20-to-1 on digital advertising during the 2016 election, Priorities decided to become a year-round effort and focus on closing the gap, instead of following its post-2012 plan of shutting down between presidential elections.\n\n“Unlike the other side, the left does not have a history of consistent structural PACs or (c)(4)s, outside of issue PACs and candidate PACs. … We have not typically invested in PACs just as a part of the liberal-progressive structure,” Priorities USA President Guy Cecil said during a recent interview. “Essentially, that’s why we chose to exist.”\n\nPriorities USA, which in the past raised almost no money during midterm election years, plans to spend $75 million this cycle, according to Cecil. It currently employs 80 staff — quadruple the 20 individuals who worked at Priorities USA during the 2016 election — a reflection of how the organization operates more and more like a permanent party committee.\n\nAmerican Bridge, the Democratic opposition research hub, has also raised more money than in past years and built out new capacity by adding a team devoted to tracking governors races. The group now has more than 90 paid staff on board in September — more than the 80-plus people it employed at the height of the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nSome Republican super PACs such as those operated by the Koch network, which includes year-round field canvassers in 36 states, have been operating with permanent super PAC structures for years.\n\nAs Priorities USA and other super PACs have put down deeper roots, progressive politicians, many of them first-time candidates for office, have begun rejecting corporate PAC money and pledging to get money out of politics en masse. To date, 111 candidates running for federal office have taken an anti-corporate PAC pledge and advanced to the general election, including more than half of the DCCC’s “Red to Blue” list who are seeking to unseat congressional Republicans, according to the pro-reform PAC End Citizens United. In 2016, only three candidates on the list had taken the pledge.\n\nThe message has emerged as a central part of some candidates’ platforms and even in television ads.\n\n“Politicians like Dan Donovan sell out to corporate PACs, and we can’t get anything done,” says Democrat Max Rose, who is challenging New York Rep. Dan Donovan, in a recent ad. “I’ve got a message for the lobbyists and the corporate kingmakers: keep your damn money, because it’s not you I’m working for.”\n\nPressley, who defeated incumbent Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) in a primary challenge from the left in early September, used the issue to differentiate herself in a race between two progressive candidates.\n\nCandidates like Pressley running strong pro-reform platforms will arrive in Washington with a mandate from their supporters to pass campaign finance reform, said Adam Bozzi, spokesperson for End Citizens United. ECU hopes that such a surge will reinvigorate longstanding interest in changing campaign finance laws in the Democratic Party and put government and ethics reform at the top of Democrats’ list of priorities if the party reclaims either chamber on Election Day.\n\n“They’re not going to come to Washington to get bullied,” said Bozzi. “When they get here, it’s going to be easier for them to change the system because of the way they ran their campaigns.\"", "clickbait": null}

Courtesy @astro_ricky/NASA/Handout via REUTERS\n\nShares of roofing and insulation products companies including Beacon Roofing Supply Inc (BECN.O) and Owens Corning (OC.N) rose, while insurers such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N) tumbled.\n\nFlorence, the first major hurricane to threaten the eastern United States this year, was forecast to hit the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina on Thursday. North Carolina ordered residents to evacuate the state’s Outer Banks barrier islands, and the governors of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared states of emergency.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season, which typically runs from June to November, caused more than $250 billion worth of damage in the United States in 2017.\n\nBut several industries benefited. Car rental and hotel companies saw an influx of customers, while freight companies commanded higher prices as capacity tightened due to increased demand for supplies in areas struck by hurricanes.\n\nHere is a summary of how shares are performing as Hurricane Florence approaches:\n\nBUILDING SUPPLIES\n\nHurricane Florence had a mixed effect on building products companies. Shares of roofing and insulation companies climbed, while those of cement companies fell.\n\nOn Monday, shares of Beacon Roofing rose 8.2 percent, their biggest one-day percentage jump in more than a year. Owens Corning shares rose 3.7 percent and were the top gainers on the PHLX Housing Index .HGX.\n\nShares of generator maker Generac Holdings Inc (GNRC.N) also touched a four-year high and were last up 5.6 percent.\n\nBut Summit Materials Inc (SUM.N) shares fell 8.1 percent after the cement and concrete supplier warned of adverse weather, including Hurricane Florence, hurting performance in several of its markets. The shares of peer companies Martin Marietta Materials Inc (MLM.N), Vulcan Materials Co (VMC.N) and Eagle Materials Inc (EXP.N) also declined between 2 percent and 3.5 percent.\n\nHOME IMPROVEMENT\n\nShares of Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N) and Home Depot hit record highs on Monday. Lowe’s shares were last trading 2.2 percent higher, while Home Depot shares were up 2.6 percent.\n\nDuring the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Home Depot shares rose 16.3 percent. But Lowe’s shares only rose 4.7 percent during that period, lagging the S&P 500, as the chain struggled to compete with Home Depot.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nAllstate shares fell 1.9 percent on Monday. The insurer had a 10.5 percent market share in South Carolina and a 6.6 percent market share in North Carolina, according to Sandler O’Neill.\n\nShares of Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N), Progressive Corp (PGR.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N) declined between 1 percent and 2 percent.\n\nCAR RENTAL\n\nShares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc (HTZ.N) and Avis Budget Group Inc (CAR.O) surged during much of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season on investors’ anticipation of increased demand. Hertz shares climbed 156.2 percent between June and early November, while Avis shares rose 80.1 percent.\n\nOn Monday, Hertz shares rose 4.4 percent and Avis shares added 2.7 percent.\n\nFREIGHT\n\nIn 2017 between June 1 and Dec. 1, shares of USA Truck Inc (USAK.O) soared 172.9 percent, while shares of XPO Logistics Inc (XPO.N) and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL.O) climbed more than 40 percent. J B Hunt Transport Services (JBHT.O) shares rose 26.7 percent over the same period.\n\nOn Monday, XPO Logistics shares rose 5.4 percent. USA Truck shares advanced 3.8 percent, J B Hunt gained 3.7 percent and Old Dominion added 1.6 percent.\n\nHOTELS\n\nShares of hotel operators were little changed on Monday. They had gained during the 2017 hurricane season as demand from guests displaced by hurricanes outweighed the hit from storm damage.\n\nFrom June 1 to Dec. 1, 2017, shares of Hyatt Hotels Corp (H.N) jumped 25.8 percent. Shares of Marriott International Inc (MAR.O), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) and Choice Hotels International Inc (CHH.N) rose up to 18.9 percent.", "clickbait": null}

This latest flight, Fear: Trump in the White House, finds President Donald Trump lurching and floundering in agony over the legal pains the Russia investigation have inflicted upon his administration, and it fully explains why Trump’s lawyers have avoided exposing him to the interrogatory requested by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nOn the afternoon of Jan. 27, 2018, Woodward writes, Trump and his attorney, John M. Dowd, met in the White House residence. Seated with the president “at a table with a view of the Washington and Jefferson Memorials,” Dowd proposed a practice run-through of the interview that Mueller had requested—and continues to request to this day.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“I would just like to give you sort of a feel of what testimony could be like,” Dowd said to Trump, a man who has submitted himself over his long and litigious life to dozens of depositions. One of the most memorable, and damning for Trump, is the one he gave during his 2006 libel suit against biographer Timothy O’Brien. As O’Brien wrote in Bloomberg in January, “Trump ultimately had to admit 30 times that he had lied over the years about all sorts of stuff: how much of a big Manhattan real estate project he owned; the price of one of his golf club memberships; the size of the Trump Organization; his wealth; his speaking fees; how many condos he had sold; his debts, and whether he borrowed money from his family to avoid going personally bankrupt. He also lied during the deposition about his business dealings with career criminals.”\n\nThe mock interview with Dowd showed that Trump had not done much since then to improve his testimony game. For one thing, Trump couldn’t remember anything. “I’m not sure,” Trump said to one question about Michael Flynn. “I don’t know,” he said to another. “I don’t know. I can’t remember,” he said to another question. To another query, “Trump said he couldn’t remember.” “You know, I don’t know,” he said to still another as if his memory banks had been degaussed.\n\nBut that wasn’t the worst of it. Actually, Trump could remember some things, and on those select things, he claimed perfect recall.\n\n“Why did you tell Director Comey that—you kind of asked him to take it easy on Flynn,” Dowd said to Trump.\n\n“I didn’t say that,” the president protested. “John, I absolutely didn’t say that.”\n\nWhen Dowd pressed him, Trump did what he does when not blinded by memory’s fog or all-seeing: He detonated into a Yosemite Sam-style rant, calling Comey a crook and a liar in his well-practiced critique. After a brief interval, Trump promptly returned to yowl-mode, rendering the next 30 minutes useless, housefly Woodward writes. “It was quite a sight seeing the president of the United States fuming like some aggrieved Shakespearean king,” Woodward continues. “Trump finally came down from the ceiling and began to regain composure,” and Dowd explained, tactfully, that his mercurial nature meant he couldn’t possibly testify.\n\n“I’ll be a real good witness,” Trump later told Dowd, but Dowd gave it to him unvarnished. “You are not a good witness.”\n\nWoodward’s account and the scathing op-ed by Anonymous published this week in the New York Times confirms everything we’ve learned about Trump’s relationship with the truth. In the president’s version, he’s never at fault; he’s the victim. He’s reckless and ill-informed, as Anonymous put it, a flip-flopper extraordinaire. “Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails,” Anonymous wrote, echoing Dowd’s mock-testimony session.\n\nTo be a good witness, you must remain consistent, but that skill is not in Trump’s tool bag. In fact, he has made an art of self-contradiction. This week, one of his first responses to the Anonymous piece was to call it phony. But inside the same tweet, he demanded that the New York Times surrender the author’s identity to him “for National Security purposes.” On Friday, he called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the identity of Anonymous, although no law had been broken, and for a lie-detector test to be administered to those suspected of writing the op-ed. He also claimed he was contemplating action against the New York Times, but didn’t say what sort of action. Trump also tweeted that “the Woodward book is a scam,” and that he doesn’t talk the way he was quoted. New York Times reporters Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman quickly proved his claim about the way he talks to be false, showing that he has used phrases like “dumb Southerner” and “retard” before.\n\nTrump’s current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, fully understands Trump’s unique relationship with the truth, which is why he keeps filibustering the question of a Mueller interview. One minute he tells the Associated Press the president wouldn’t answer Mueller’s obstruction of justice questions, the next moment he tells NBC News those questions are “not ruled in or out.” Because Mueller and his people don’t talk to the press, Giuliani is essentially playing tennis against the wall, hitting the ball ever harder and claiming every line call in his favor.\n\nAs Axios reported this week, Giuliani is essentially daring Mueller to subpoena the president, gambling that the special counsel doesn’t possess the moxie to fight the legal question of whether a president can be forced to give testimony. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that President Richard Nixon had to give up White House recordings and documents, but has never ruled on whether a president must testify. On Friday, the Giuliani hijinks continued, as he demanded to see a draft of Mueller’s report before it’s released so his team can rebut it contemporaneously. Some legal authorities interviewed by Business Insider essentially said, Nice try, Rudy, explaining that the report’s future is really up to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller. “Expect the Mueller report to be buttoned down and based on provable facts,” Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor told Business Insider. “Expect the White House response to be anything but that.”\n\nWoodward morphs from housefly to stinging horse-fly in the last paragraph of Fear as he offers Dowd’s final assessment of the president. “Trump had one overriding problem that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president: ‘You’re a fucking liar.’”\n\n******\n\n“The reason I talk to myself is because I’m the only one whose answers I accept,” George Carlin once said.

There are currently 206 seats where Democrats have the advantage, compared to 205 for Republicans. But more of Democrats’ seats are safely in their column when compared to Republicans, and national trends suggest the wind is at Democrats’ back.\n\nFor POLITICO’s race ratings, each of the 435 House elections, 36 Senate contests — and 36 governor’s races, too — is rated on a 7-point scale: Solid Democratic, Likely Democratic, Lean Democratic, Toss-Up, Lean Republican, Likely Republican and Solid Republican.\n\nHouse\n\nThe election cycle began with Republicans holding key structural assets in the battle for House control. But over the course of the past year-and-a-half, those advantages have gradually eroded.\n\nRepublicans started with a number of entrenched incumbents in seats that swung against the GOP in last year’s presidential election. The problem? Many of them — like Ed Royce and Darrell Issa in Southern California, Rodney Frelinghuysen in New Jersey, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in South Florida and Dave Reichert in Washington state — chose to retire rather than run for reelection. Since incumbent members typically have more campaign cash in the bank and run stronger than candidates in open seats, it provided Democrats with a more even playing field than they might have otherwise had.\n\nAll told, more than 40 House Republicans aren’t seeking reelection, and Democrats already have the advantage in a number of these seats, including those currently held by Issa, Frelinghuysen, Ros-Lehtinen and Reichert.\n\nMany of the GOP incumbents who are running have their own problems. Fifty-six Republican incumbents were outraised by the Democratic challengers in the most recent fundraising quarter, and 16 of them trailed in cash on hand as of the end of June. One reason is that Democrats have been able to raise funds at a greater clip than past minority parties, in large part thanks to an unprecedented online fundraising network. Republicans are in better shape when it comes to outside money — Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading pro-GOP super PAC — had $73.3 million in cash on hand as of mid-July, its latest report with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nDemocrats also managed to chip away at another House GOP firewall: the maps under which the elections will be held. Nowhere is that more obvious than Pennsylvania: Republicans held a 13-to-5 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation at the beginning of 2017, but thanks to court-ordered redrawing of the districts, Democrats could capture a majority of the state’s House seats this November.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Trump — his average approval rating is down to 42 percent — and the GOP are near-toxic at a national level. Democrats’ lead on the generic ballot, on average, is in the high-single digits.\n\nAll the math — national and at the district level — boils down to this: Roughly half of the seats Democrats need to pick up are already leaning in their column.\n\nFour seats currently in GOP hands are even classified as Safe or Likely Democratic — New Jersey’s 2nd District and Pennsylvania’s 5th, 6th and 17th districts. In New Jersey, national Republicans have cut loose the party’s nominee, Seth Grossman, over bigoted statements Grossman has made in the past. Pennsylvania’s 5th and 6th districts are poised to move into the Democratic column as a result of new, favorable district lines. In Pennsylvania’s 17th District, Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb has a consistent lead over GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus in a member-vs.-member contest.\n\nDemocrats have another 10 Republican seats leaning in their direction — their candidates are currently favored, though not assured of victory. Four GOP incumbents are at least slight underdogs: Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia, Steve Knight in Southern California, Rod Blum in Eastern Iowa, Andy Barr in Kentucky. And Democrats are also favored to pick up seats where incumbents are retiring: Issa’s San Diego-area seat, Ros-Lehtinen’s Miami seat, Reichert’s Washington state seat, and a seat in southern North Carolina, where GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger lost his primary.\n\nOf the two-dozen seats rated as Toss-Ups, 23 are currently held by Republicans; just one, the southern Minnesota seat Rep. Tim Walz is vacating to run for governor, is held by a Democrat.\n\nSimilarly, of the 27 seats rated as Lean Republican, 26 are currently held by the GOP. Republicans’ best pick-up opportunity: the Minnesota Iron Range seat being vacated by retiring Rep. Rick Nolan.\n\nThere are some self-inflicted wounds for Republicans on the House map. Blum, whose seat is rated Lean Democratic, is facing an investigation by the House ethics committee. Virginia Rep. Scott Taylor’s campaign is under investigation for allegedly forging signatures on the qualification papers of an independent candidate that could siphon votes away from Elaine Luria, the Democratic nominee.\n\nTwo GOP incumbents are under federal indictments: New York Rep. Chris Collins and California Rep. Duncan Hunter. Republicans are trying to replace Collins — who said he doesn’t want to run again, even though he is the GOP nominee — on the ballot, but Democrats have promised to fight his removal. Hunter, meanwhile, is full-steam-ahead on his reelection bid in what would have otherwise been a safe GOP district.\n\nAll is not lost for Republicans: Some of their incumbents are in better-than-expected shape, given the Democratic lean of their districts. Reps. Carlos Curbelo (Florida), Will Hurd (Texas) and John Katko (New York) are favored to win reelection.\n\nDemocrats will make gains on Election Day, and a “wave election” is possible — though not yet guaranteed. An improvement in the national environment — combined with GOP outside groups’ hand-to-hand combat in some of these districts — can still result in Republicans’ saving their House majority.\n\nWith two months to go until Election Day, the House is rated as Lean Democratic.\n\nSenate\n\nRepublicans control 51 of the chamber’s 100 seats — or at least they will when former Sen. Jon Kyl takes the seat of late Arizona Sen. John McCain — and Democrats would need to net two seats in order to win back control. (Because Vice President Mike Pence breaks any ties in the chamber, a 50-50 Senate would still be controlled by Republicans.)\n\nThere are far more GOP opportunities on the board than chances for Democrats to pick up seats. Ten Democratic incumbents are seeking reelection in states Trump carried in 2016, while only Nevada Sen. Dean Heller is protecting a GOP-held seat in a Clinton state.\n\nOf the Democrats, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is the most vulnerable. Trump carried the state by 36 percentage points in 2016, and Republicans are confident Rep. Kevin Cramer will defeat her this fall. North Dakota is rated as Lean Republican.\n\nThe GOP also likes its chances to topple Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. Trump carried both states by just under 20 points. An NBC News/Marist poll out this week showed McCaskill deadlocked with her GOP challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley. Both races are rated as Toss Ups.\n\nThe Florida Senate race — which pits Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson against GOP Gov. Rick Scott — is also rated a Toss Up. As of early August, Scott had already spent $27.9 million on his campaign, and Democrats fear Nelson isn’t keeping pace. But Scott only won narrow victories in 2010 and 2014 — in great environments for Republicans — and the two candidates are still neck-and-neck, despite Scott’s early barrage.\n\nDemocrats are looking a little better in Montana and West Virginia — two other solid Trump states. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester is ahead of state Auditor Matt Rosendale, though Republicans hope Trump can help peel voters away from Tester.\n\nThat’s also true in West Virginia, where the president is expected to travel frequently before November. But Sen. Joe Manchin leads state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the latest polling. Both Montana and West Virginia are rated as Lean Democratic.\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s race against GOP state Sen. Leah Vukmir is rated as Lean Democratic, while three other Rust Belt Democrats are in the Likely Democratic column: Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Bob Casey (Pa.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio).\n\nAs for Democratic pick-up opportunities, two GOP-held seats are rated as Toss Ups: Arizona and Nevada. In Arizona — a state trending more Democratic over the past decade — the race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and GOP Rep. Martha McSally is likely to go down to the wire.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nevada, Heller has held his own with Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen thus far, polls show.\n\nTwo GOP-held seats are rated as Lean Republican: Tennessee, where popular former Gov. Phil Bredesen is running against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, and Texas, with Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s high-profile challenge of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBredesen is running roughly even with Blackburn in Tennessee, but Trump carried the state by 26 points in 2016. In Texas, Cruz is fully engaged and taking O’Rourke seriously.\n\nReclaiming the Senate requires Democrats to win all of the Toss Ups — and hold Heitkamp’s North Dakota seat. Or the party could lose North Dakota, but win all the Toss Ups and either Tennessee or Texas. Either way, it’s a tightrope walk at this point in the cycle. The Senate is rated as Likely Republican.\n\nGovernors\n\nDemocrats are likely to make gains in the number of governorships the party controls, a key pillar of the party’s plan to have more influence in policy-making — and the redrawing of political maps after the 2020 Census.\n\nTwo states that currently have GOP governors are now rated as Likely Democratic: Illinois and New Mexico. In Illinois, incumbent GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner is trailing Democrat J.B. Pritzker by a wide margin.\n\nThe race to replace Michigan GOP Gov. Rick Snyder is rated Lean Democratic: Gretchen Whitmer is a modest favorite over GOP state Attorney General Bill Schuette.\n\nOf the seven governors races in the Toss-Up column, all are in states currently helmed by Republicans: Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin. In Florida, a Quinnipiac University pol l out Tuesday gave Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the newly minted Democratic nominee, a slight advantage over Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn Wisconsin, two-term GOP Gov. Scott Walker is in the fight of his political life against state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers.\n\nRepublicans are looking a little stronger in five other races the party currently holds, which are rated as Lean Republican: Arizona, Kansas, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Vermont. The Alaska governor’s race is also rated as Lean Republican; the incumbent, Bill Walker, is an independent.\n\nThe GOP has a few pick-up opportunities from Democrats, though the Republican candidate is an underdog in all of them. Hawaii, Minnesota and Pennsylvania are rated Likely Democratic. Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon and Rhode Island are more winnable for Republicans, but each is rated Lean Democratic.\n\nTwo bright spots for Republicans: Massachusetts and Maryland. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker’s reelection effort is rated as Safe Republican, even in the bright-blue commonwealth. Meanwhile, the race in Maryland is rated Likely Republican, with Gov. Larry Hogan holding a big lead in the polls over Democratic nominee Ben Jealous.\n\nThe topline: Democrats are favored to pick up three governorships from Republicans, while the GOP could erase the only independent from the map. But the seven Toss-Up states are all held by Republicans, and a Democratic wave could flip those into the blue column.\n\n", "clickbait": null}

But the concerns over the bill are largely flowing from the Republican side, mainly from members fighting to keep hold of seats in suburban districts where President Donald Trump is most unpopular — and that are key to the GOP’s hopes of keeping their majority.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA dozen House Republicans, all but one of them from the high-tax states of California, New Jersey and New York, voted against the tax law in December because it capped state and local tax deductions, which they said would lead to tax increases on too many of their constituents.\n\nSome of those GOP lawmakers have openly said they would prefer to leave the tax issue alone as Congress also grapples with how to fund the government and the House potentially votes on health care measures that might be more politically beneficial to vulnerable incumbents. “If we were to pass that here in the House, it would be an exercise in futility, because it could never pass in the Senate,” Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey, who opposed the first bill, said Friday on CNBC.\n\nTop House leaders will unveil the second tax overhaul bill this week. Drafted by House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the bill proposes to make permanent individual tax rate cuts from the Republicans’ first tax bill, while introducing new measures intended to help families save money, especially for retirement, and to spur innovation for businesses.\n\nMorning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHouse leaders and White House officials hope it can at least pass through that chamber before the election. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill in 2018 given the focus on speeding through judicial nominations and a Supreme Court confirmation — and because Majority Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) simply does not have the votes to pass a second tax bill.\n\nRepublican leaders “certainly directed us from the get-go to be ready to move this in September,” Brady told reporters last week. “It’s full steam ahead.”\n\nGOP officials have long acknowledged that they couldn’t pack all of their priorities into a measure that eventually become last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, because no Democrats supported the bill. They passed it with a slim margin of votes using a budgetary measure called reconciliation, which required only a simple majority in the Senate, and have long wanted to revisit the bill’s tweaks to the individual side of the tax code. Those changes are scheduled to expire after 2025, while the corporate tax changes became permanent under the new law.\n\nThis time, the White House and Treasury Department largely have taken a back seat in drafting the bill, though Brady, President Donald Trump, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have remained in close touch as the bill progressed. Ways and Means lawmakers also visited the White House in July to discuss the bill, and the committee is expected to mark up the new measure on Thursday after releasing legislative text early this week.\n\nThe White House’s main concern is that the individual tax cuts are made permanent, said one Republican close to the White House, calling the other proposals more “nickel-and-dime” stuff. Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump also have visited Capitol Hill to discuss various parts of the bill, according to one administration official.\n\nShahira Knight, the relatively new White House director of legislative affairs, who helped write the Republicans' first tax bill in close concert with top economic staffers and lawmakers, will help shepherd this 2.0 bill through the House, in addition to tackling the farm and multiple spending bills. Since the first tax bill passed, one of Trump’s top informal economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, has become director of the National Economic Council, putting into the White House a firm champion of cutting taxes to spur economic growth.\n\nSome administration officials have expressed regret about the way the individual side of the tax code turned out under the Republican tax bill. “The part of tax reform to me that was so important was really the corporate side,” said Gary Cohn, the White House’s former top economic adviser, at a Washington event in June. “One thing that haunts me,” however, is that Republicans were not able to make the individual income-tax cuts permanent, he said.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the amount of stock buybacks that have followed the tax law and maintain the law has done little to help the average worker, and they are likely to pound those themes again when discussing the second bill.\n\nDemocrats might have run from that fight in the past, given how often Republicans label them tax hikers. But these days, they are more than happy to relitigate last year’s tax law, which they have insisted from the start would heap savings onto corporations and the wealthy while leaving behind the middle class.\n\nThe more even ground on taxes shows up in polling, too. The new tax law has not been the political plus that many Republicans expected as they try to hold on to the House, only becoming less popular since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe House Republican preview of the new bill also floated a range of new tools for families to increase savings, including creating a new Universal Savings Account and making it easier to contribute to Individual Retirement Accounts.\n\nLawmakers and aides in both parties say it’s possible that retirement provisions could pass as part of a year-end tax deal after the election. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel’s top Democrat, previously have teamed up on bipartisan retirement savings legislation.\n\n“My feeling is that it’s fine. It is certainly smart to make the tax cuts permanent, but it is not urgent, because those don’t expire for many years,” said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and informal economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign. “I would still support the bill because it is probably a good thing for Republicans to always be on the offensive on cutting taxes.”\n\n", "clickbait": null}

Although the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood, the PLO has maintained in Washington a general delegation office that facilitates Palestinian officials’ interactions with the U.S. government.\n\nThe head of the PLO delegation to the U.S. accused the Trump administration of “dismantling decades of U.S. vision and engagement in Palestine.”\n\n“Weaponizing humanitarian and developmental aid as political blackmail does not work,” Ambassador Husam Zomlot said.\n\nTrump has delivered a number of blows to the Palestinians during his time in office.\n\nMost recently his administration ended U.S. funding for the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees, slashing hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for projects in the West Bank and Gaza and cutting funding to hospitals in Jerusalem that serve Palestinians.\n\nTrump also recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the U.S. Embassy there, from Tel Aviv. Dozens of Palestinians were killed in protests that followed the move, and Palestinians have since rejected the U.S. as a peace broker.\n\nAlthough the Israelis and Palestinians are not engaged in active, direct negotiations, Trump’s administration has been working to mediate a peace deal that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior aide, White House officials have been preparing a peace proposal they intend to put forward at an unspecified time.\n\nTrump has promised to pursue the “ultimate deal” between the Palestinians and Israel.

The very idea of value neutrality that rose to prominence after World War II—the idea that individuals or institutions can fairly arbitrate among competing values in a pluralistic society—has fallen on hard times, leaving us unsure of where to turn for a reliable account of the world.\n\nIt’s easy to blame Donald Trump for this shift, with his casual mendacity and contempt for conventions. He has cavalierly trashed institutions he dislikes, from CNN to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to the intelligence agencies, as tools of the opposition, encouraging his followers to dismiss their pretenses of fairness. But Trump isn’t the root of this problem so much as a poisonous flower. The cynicism he exploits and deepens has been metastasizing for decades. Now it has reached stage 4.\n\nWe can already see the implications: dysfunctional Washington politics, a shrill public discourse rife with accusations of bad faith, conspiracy theories sprouting like toadstools, sharp hostility to universities. The inability to marshal a national consensus even on basic facts—like the Russian efforts to disrupt our elections—has prevented us from taking steps to secure our democracy and left many fearful about the soundness of our system. Without trust in the government and other neutral bodies to provide reliable information and to adjudicate fairly among viewpoints, we risk losing one of our democracy’s greatest virtues: the ability to wage our debates freely and contentiously while knowing that ultimately most of us will accept the resolutions as legitimate. Without such acceptance, self-government becomes like a trial without a judge, a boxing match without a referee. What happened?\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe importance we place on neutrality in our institutions is actually somewhat new. It grew out of what the intellectual historian Edward Purcell, in the title of an influential 1973 book, called the “crisis of democratic theory,” which gripped American intellectual culture in the 1920s and ’30s. In that era, worldwide depression and a backlash against the idealism of World War I undermined the grounds for believing that democracy was necessarily the best form of government. Because philosophers and social scientists had come to embrace empiricism over rationalism—arguing that our knowledge came from experience, not reason—many intellectuals had lost their confidence in the older philosophical principles that had once seemed absolute. A relativistic outlook seeped into American culture, even affecting how people thought about democracy.\n\nBut in the crucible of World War II and the fight against totalitarianism, Purcell showed, there emerged a revised defense of democracy. In place of the fashionable cynicism of the 1920s and ’30s came the idea that democracy was superior as a system of government precisely because it wasn’t absolute. It allowed multiple viewpoints to coexist and compete, and it was capable of revision. Although this argument took place at a rarefied level, among scholars and intellectuals, their ideas crept into popular thought.\n\nTrust In Institutions According to Gallup, Americans’ trust in institutions, from newspapers to the Supreme Court to public schools, has steadily declined, reaching historic lows over the past decade. The share with a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in Congress has dropped from a high of 42 percent when the survey was first conducted in 1973 to 11 percent in 2018.\n\nCredit: Getty Images\n\nThe new understanding of democracy as experimental, like science, meant government was best seen as a neutral manager of competing interests, not an instrument for imposing an ideology. A set of ideas might prevail in a given election, but victory was provisional. Democracy, one might say, was a verb; its value consisted in continuing to enact it. “The totalitarians regard the toleration of conflict as our central weakness,” Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote in 1949. “But we know it to be basically our central strength.”\n\nThe institutions that promote and disseminate knowledge came to rest on similar assumptions. In the late 19th century, America’s great research universities arose, and the social sciences flourished by claiming to put knowledge on a more scientific, empirical basis. Similarly, as early as the 1890s, newspaper journalism had come to value factual reporting over editorializing; by the 1920s, objectivity and commitment to facts were understood as helpful ways to avoid the pitfalls of the subjective. In the years after World War II, these tendencies settled into guiding principles. These institutions promoted inquiry, fairness, openness and the competition of ideas.\n\nThe post-war decades were hardly free of turmoil, from McCarthyism to the struggles for racial equality. But with the far right and far left in retreat, President John F. Kennedy could proclaim, as he did in 1962, that “the central domestic issues of our time … relate not to basic clashes of philosophy or ideology but to ways and means of reaching common goals—to research for sophisticated solutions to complex and obstinate issues.” Widely shared prosperity and a strong social consensus backing a liberal welfare state and an internationalist foreign policy helped Americans to trust in their political system.\n\nBy the late 1960s, however, the consensus that had prevailed was crumbling. Left and right alike made war on established authority. From both sides, one heard the same charge: that the ostensible neutrality of the government and other public institutions masked an ideology—one that was either aggressively liberal (according to the right) or cravenly conservative (according to the left).\n\nProfessional expertise came under fire. As Michael Schudson wrote in the book Discovering the News: “Critics claimed that urban planning created slums, that schools made people stupid, that medicine caused disease, that psychiatry invented mental illness, and that the courts promoted injustice.” Journalistic objectivity was now disdained not as an unattainable ideal, as it had been in the past, but as “a mystification,” in Schudson’s apt term. In academia, too, arguments against politicizing scholarship faced counterclaims that all scholarship was inherently politicized. Trust in government plummeted from its peak in the mid-1960s.\n\nEver since, intellectuals, journalists, civil servants and others have wrestled with questions of neutrality and bias. The awareness that scholars or judges might harbor a latent ideology didn’t, for the most part, keep them from aiming for objectivity. But in the academy—and in the wider culture—it fed the growth of what became known as postmodern thought. In journalism, dissatisfaction with the strictures of “straight news” encouraged a variety of innovations, including interpretive and analytical pieces, investigative reporting and the often-subjective New Journalism. Still, these early doubts about the professed neutrality of our knowledge-forming institutions did not fatally undermine them. Postmodern critiques of scholarly values were more often mocked than embraced. Objectivity remained a respected ideal.\n\nIt’s hard to say when the rejection of neutrality went from being a persistent intellectual critique to a dominant belief—or even whether it’s reached that point yet. But the battle in late 2000 over the outcome of the presidential election was a symbolic watershed. That the Supreme Court voted 5-4 along ideological lines to make George W. Bush president deepened the suspicion that not only ostensibly neutral election processes but even the law itself would succumb to the political preferences of those administering it. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens warned that “the loser” in that drama was “the Nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.”\n\nUnder Bush, the polarization that had already begun to seize Washington politics intensified, dealing body blows to neutrality. Since Richard Nixon’s presidency, Republicans had gradually built a conservative counterestablishment: think tanks, foundations, societies, networks and news outlets to promote their ideas. By Bush’s presidency, it was possible to find “experts” who could lend a patina of authority to conservative policy positions otherwise unsupported by solid research—whether on evolution, birth control, global warming or even the origins of the universe. Even Bush’s most controversial undertaking, the invasion of Iraq, relied on an alternative set of intelligence analysts, after those at the CIA and elsewhere failed to return the findings that Bush had hoped for.\n\nFox News was crucial to this development. Founded in 1996 by the longtime Republican consultant Roger Ailes, it gained influence in the Bush years—especially after the 9/11 terrorist attacks—and wooed viewers away from what were now being called the mainstream media. But Fox’s claim of being an ideological alternative to the networks was misleading. Those networks aspired to neutrality; they weren’t trying to advance liberal causes (even if some perceived bias in their reports). Fox, despite claiming to be “fair and balanced,” reflected the pronounced ideological agenda of the man who ran it—a thoroughgoing conservative cultural populist. So liberals began to emulate the right’s methods. MSNBC began to turn itself—if half-heartedly—into a liberal Fox. And if Air America tried (and failed) to be the mirror of Rush Limbaugh, many podcasts are now succeeding at the task.\n\nSo, too, with think tanks. Conservative shops like the Heritage Foundation might have fancied themselves right-wing counterweights to “liberal” ones like the Brookings Institution, but Brookings, like the network news shows, adhered to a neutral scholarly ideal. Lacking a Heritage of their own, Democrats in 2003 founded the Center for American Progress, with a pronounced partisan orientation. Now, key sources of information bear a partisan stamp, undermining their claims to independent authority.\n\n\n\n***\n\nUnder Trump, neutrality has become a difficult position for any individual or institution to maintain. Everyone is expected to take a side. Even attempts to articulate safe, bipartisan points of consensus run afoul of tribal suspicions. Journalists who serve up anodyne platitudes about a free press suddenly seem like militant anti-Trumpers, while commonsense pleas from no less than Barack Obama not to ignore someone’s ideas solely on the basis of his race or sex are mocked as wrongheaded or naive. Where the early internet, with its blogs and comments, had put pressure on the mainstream media, social media have amplified that pressure many times over—with Twitter enticing officially neutral reporters into staking out positions, voiced with sarcasm, snark or notes of partisanship that would be verboten in the news pages. No sooner does someone try to set up a new kind of neutral arbiter—like the invaluable fact-checking sites PolitiFact and FactCheck.org—than that, too, comes under fire for bias, as these sites have from the right. PolitiFact founder Bill Adair is trying to create an automated tool that conservatives will accept as neutral—though allegations that Facebook’s algorithms are politically skewed suggest that not even a computer program can attain that holy status anymore.\n\nOn campuses, departments now offer courses in “social justice,” which usually means the advocacy of left-wing politics, and university presidents feel pressure to take liberal political stands. Republicans no longer consider universities forces for good. In law, opposition is growing to widely respected concepts like viewpoint-neutrality—the idea that the government can’t punish speech based on its content. Even legal scholars on the left, as the New York Times’ Adam Liptak wrote, “have traded an absolutist commitment to free speech for one sensitive to the harms it can inflict.” The First Amendment, in some eyes, isn’t really neutral anymore.\n\nThe demise of neutrality lies behind the dominant political problems of our age. It is responsible for all the chatter about a “post-truth society” that we have heard lately. Truth still exists, of course, but agreement on the truth feels more elusive than it has in a long time. That spells danger for democracy, which depends on constructive argument and deliberation. Without trusted sources of information or respected vehicles of settling differences, there is only partisan argument and the triumph of the powerful.\n\nThe collapse of neutral institutions also feeds a vicious cycle of polarization and extremism. When institutions no longer enjoy credibility across the political spectrum, people look to more ideological sources for confirmation of what they want to believe. Conservatives drift toward the Tea Party and Trump, and progressives toward left-wing radicalism. Some long-standing neutral institutions, particularly in journalism, seem to be feeling pressure to abandon their historic role in order to please their audiences. If a reporter or scholar or judge isn’t anticipating good-faith critiques from a range of viewpoints, he is less likely to shore up his thinking to make his conclusions broadly palatable.\n\nWhen we anticipate the future, we usually project trends to continue—and that promises a long dark night of discord. But it’s also conceivable that the Trump presidency, with its ceaseless chaos and disruption, will prompt a recognition of what is being lost and fuel demand for a rebirth of statesmanship and objectivity. In the 1930s and ’40s, it wasn’t just the threat of totalitarianism but its lure—to those frustrated with the imperfections of democracy—that forced Americans to justify their democracy in more durable ways. The current crisis is forcing us to examine the intellectual and practical bases of our system. With luck, we will, in seeing its weaknesses, have the wisdom to figure out how to shore it up.\n\nLet’s just hope that this time, it won’t take a world war to change our minds.\n\nDavid Greenberg is a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers, and author of Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency.", "clickbait": null}

It’s a pilot project designed to demonstrate tiny homes, arranged in a community where rules are set by the residents themselves, should be part of the solution to combating homelessness in Denver.\n\nIt’s had its challenges. Two of the original residents returned to the streets after their neighbors asked them to leave for violating village rules. The village had to move about 200 feet in January — from one side of its lot to the other — at a cost of $25,000 because of now-changed city rules governing temporary residential structures. The city chipped in $10,000.\n\nBut Beloved has persevered. A year after opening, supporters are touting the results of a University of Denver study of the village as proof it is improving lives, both for its residents who were chronically homeless and in the surrounding community.\n\n“Unfortunately, the residents here have had to be the guinea pigs, but they have helped us sort out some of the issues that will help improve the model as we scale into the future,” Cole Chandler, a member of the Colorado Village Collaborative, said. “We intend to see dozens of these villages across the metro area.”\n\nThe study assessed the village from its opening on July 21, 2017, through April. Among the key findings:\n\nOf the 12 original village residents who participated in the study — one person declined — 10 remained housed through April. It goes beyond the scope of the study, but those 10 people are still in stable housing today, Chandler said,\n\nThree residents moved out of the village into housing of their own. Two of them, a couple, saved up for their own apartment, Chandler said. A third person was approved for Section 8 rental assistance.\n\nAnd all villagers — nine of whom were already working when they moved in — were either employed, in school or collecting disability, as of April. That fact also holds true today.\n\nTo read the full findings of the study, visit bartoninstitute.org/tiny-homes.\n\nThere were 5,317 people experiencing homelessness in Denver and seven surrounding counties in January, according to a point-in-time report compiled by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative. For Chandler, whose organization was created to help establish and support tiny home villages in Denver, the study demonstrates that more communities like Beloved should be built in the metro area and soon.\n\n“The idea was to build low-barrier housing for people with barriers to accessing the existing system” he said, noting each tiny home cost $22,000 to build. “With traditional housing-first scenarios, there are a lot of overhead costs with all of the support systems that they create, which are very helpful for a large portion of the population. We can do things at a lower cost.”\n\nThe study was performed by the DU’s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. It was commissioned by the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, also a part of DU. The institute has invested a combined $91,725in building and assessing the Beloved village and a proposed second village that Chandler’s group is seeking to build in Denver, director Rebecca Arno said.\n\nArno suspects the village’s self-governing model, with residents setting guidelines for behavior and other aspects of community life, has empowered the people living there.\n\nCersilla Wolf, one of the village’s charter members, has enrolled in college classes, opened an Etsy.com shop selling her own crocheted wares and began working at nearby Bigsby’s Folly Winery & Restaurant in RiNo, which reached out to the Colorado Village Collaborative about hiring a villager.\n\nWolf also has taken on the mantle of resident finder. She built a second, lofted bed into her home and brought in two other people struggling to find stable housing to live with her.\n\nFreddie Martin has been Wolf’s roommate since March after meeting her on the Metro State University campus. A history major who takes notes during village meetings to “create a historical record,” Martin said he hasn’t had a secure home in about a decade. He’s paid rent to live with friends but hasn’t been able to raise the money — including a security deposit and first and last month’s rent — to move out on his own. Now housed, he hopes to finish his degree in the fall.\n\n“This place has been a godsend,” Martin said.\n\nWolf’s first roommate, Kim Grier, lives next door now. The 27-year-old is trying to get a photography business off the ground while working at King Soopers.\n\n“When I got this house, this was the first place I ever had to live that wasn’t dependent on my emotional relationship with another person,” she said. “It’s a place that’s yours, where you can think.”\n\nThe DU study also examined the village’s impact on the surrounding neighborhood. Combining responses from a random sampling of nearby residents and a selective sampling of business owners, researchers found 78 percent of people in the area believe the village either didn’t hurt community safety or helped it — a perception supported by crime data.\n\n“Even the people who at the beginning of this process told me this will never work, this will be a disaster, have come back and said, ‘Wow, were we wrong,’ ” said RiNo Art District president Jamie Giellis. “It’s been awesome.”\n\nThe Village won’t be behind its colorful fence at 38th and Blake much longer. Chandler said an agreement is in place with a new property owner host, but he’s not ready to say where until more community outreach can be done. Colorado Village Collaborative hopes to raise $90,000 for a new commons building for the village when it does move, one with running water, three bathrooms and a full kitchen.\n\nUrban Land Conservancy, the nonprofit that owns the land Beloved sits on today, is moving forward with plans to develop the lot. The Walnut Street side will be turned into 66 affordable apartments in partnership with Medici Communities, conservancy president Aaron Miripol said. The Blake Street half will be sold to local developer McWhinney, which expects to build a 16-story mixed-use building that will also house Urban Land Conservancy’s office.\n\nColorado Village Collaborative was dealt a setback this month when Denver’s Landmark Preservation Commission voted that it could not proceed with building an eight-home women’s village on the property of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church at 2015 Glenarm Place because it didn’t fit with the surrounding historic district.\n\nThe vote was a temporary setback in Chandler’s view. He plans to meet next week with another property owner who he says has offered to host the women’s village for three years. He hopes to get it built before winter.\n\nMiripol, who has been involved with efforts to provide stable housing for people in need for decades, said he has been frustrated by the barriers that have cropped up and prevented the tiny home concept from growing in Denver and beyond. He hopes the results of the DU study will help turn the tide.\n\n“You can have a successful community like this. You can have an impact on people’s lives and you can do it in a way that is not harming the community, but in fact is very positive,” he said. “It’s important other folks step up and do this too.”", "clickbait": null}

Driscoll argued the videos countered the government's attempts to undermine the legitimacy of Butina and Erickson's relationship and, more broadly, her ties to the United States. Chutkan said the videos were not relevant to whether Butina should stay behind bars.\n\nChutkan did chastise prosecutors for making the “rather salacious” claim early in the case that Butina had offered sex for a job, only to walk it back later after Butina’s lawyers published the contents of the messages at issue and argued that they showed that Butina and a friend were joking. The judge said she was \"dismayed\" that the government concluded the texts were evidence of a serious offer to trade sex, noting it took her five minutes to read the messages and conclude they were joking.\n\n“It really makes it difficult to have a fair trial when those statements are made,” Chutkan said.\n\nThe judge didn’t penalize the government for what prosecutors said in court filings last week was an \"error.\" The judge commended them for coming clean.\n\nButina has been in custody since she was arrested on July 16. She has pleaded not guilty to charges that she acted as an illegal agent for Russia in the United States and conspired to do so. At a hearing on July 18, a federal magistrate judge agreed with prosecutors that Butina should be detained pending trial, finding there weren’t any release conditions that would satisfy the judge that Butina wouldn’t flee the country.\n\nOn Aug. 24, Butina’s lawyers filed papers asking Chutkan to reconsider pretrial detention, arguing prosecutors had relied “on innuendo and undefined phrases, soundbites and alarmist buzzwords.” Notwithstanding the “patina of espionage,” Butina wasn’t charged with spying, her lawyers wrote, saying the evidence showed Butina wasn’t trying to hide what she was doing in the United States. They argued there was no evidence that the Russian government paid her or covered her expenses, or was giving her directions on what to do.\n\nChutkan echoed a concern that prosecutors had raised in arguing to keep Butina detained, which is that if Butina got into a car with diplomatic license plates, US law enforcement could not stop the vehicle. There was nothing the court could do to stop Butina from getting into a diplomatic car and going straight to an airplane, Chutkan said. The judge noted that Russia doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States, and that the Russian government had been protesting Butina's detention.\n\nButina was in court on Monday, wearing a green prison uniform. She did not speak during the hearing.\n\nIn earlier court filings arguing to keep Butina behind bars, prosecutors claimed Butina had offered sex in exchange for a job, as part of a larger argument that her relationship with a US national wasn’t strong enough to ensure she’d stay in the United States; the US person wasn’t named in charging papers, but the description matches Erickson, a Republican operative from South Dakota and NRA activist, with whom Butina was living.\n\n\n\nThe government’s July filing didn’t include any other details to back up the claim, and Butina’s lawyers pushed back, saying prosecutors relied on a misinterpretation of text messages between Butina and a friend.\n\nThe government last week walked back from the allegation, saying in a Sept. 7 filing that even if they were “mistaken” about Butina offering sex for a position, there was still other evidence that Butina’s relationship with Erickson wasn’t strong enough to ensure she wouldn’t try to flee if released from custody.\n\nThe government also pointed out that Butina had offered to provide information about Erickson to the FBI. Butina’s lawyers countered that the government was trying to punish her for cooperating.\n\n“By extension, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia suggests that true love means never cooperating with federal investigations and that only a ‘duplicitous’ partner would offer an interview with government agents or provide truthful evidence. The government’s attempt to punish Maria for choosing to cooperate with a federal investigation — like a gang member would punish a witness for snitching — is jaw dropping,” Butina’s lawyers wrote in a Sept. 9 filing.\n\nThe government also asked the judge to enter an order restricting Butina’s lawyers from making public statements about the case. Driscoll has spoken to reporters on several occasions, and prosecutors argued those comments heightened the risk of prejudicing a future trial. Driscoll had offered opinions, revealed information that wasn’t included in charging papers, and accused prosecutors of sexism, prosecutors argued.\n\nDriscoll “has repeatedly sought to elicit the prejudices and sympathies of potential jurors, casting the defendant as a daughter and sister, and as a mere student or victim,” they wrote.\n\nButina’s lawyers argued that the government was trying to stop them from countering the prejudicial information included in the government’s filings, including information that prosecutors had walked back — the claim about Butina offering sex for a job — or admitted they got wrong. In a Sept. 7 filing, prosecutors acknowledged making a “error” in how they described a visa that Butina applied for, although they said the underlying argument they were trying to make — that her new visa would allow her to travel to and from the United States — was still correct, even if the visa type was different.\n\n“It is true that the case has garnered significant publicity. However, the government is largely to blame for this fact because of its efforts to ‘sex-up’ its thin case, which makes its request to restrain Maria Butina’s right to defend herself, her reputation, and to correct the false public record sowed by the government not only disingenuous but unconstitutional,” her lawyers wrote.\n\nIn agreeing to enter an order restricting what lawyers in the case can say in public, Chutkan pointed out that Washington, DC, has a relatively small pool of potential jurors, making it more likely that inappropriate comments about the case could make it harder to seat a jury and have a fair trial.\n\nThere is no trial date. Prosecutors are still turning over evidence to Butina's lawyers, and on Monday they asked for another 60 days before giving the court the next update on the status of the case. In the meantime, Butina's lawyer Alfred Carry told the judge that they plan to file a motion to dismiss the case — he said they'll argue that she's facing two criminal counts for what is essentially the same underlying crime of being involved in a conspiracy to act as an illegal agent for the Russian government. The next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 13.", "clickbait": null}

There are other screens at the defense and prosecutor’s tables. There are even more screens in the nearby attorney-client conference rooms.\n\nWhen the judge is on the bench for child support hearings, each one of those screens plays a Powerpoint presentation with a series of slides. Each slide has a different but similar message.\n\n\n\nHelp Wanted. Inquire Within. Come Join Our Team.\n\n\n\nThe job opportunities are plentiful if you know where to look.\n\n\n\n\n\n“They can’t come up here and tell me some story that they can’t find a job,” Judge Walther said. “Some of [the defendants] really do want to get jobs. Some of them don’t. Knowledge is power and I have the knowledge now that there are plenty of jobs out there.”\n\n\n\nThe idea was hatched a couple of weeks ago. Judge Walther heard the case of a man who was behind on his child support, the judge said. The defendant claimed he couldn’t pay the child support because he couldn’t find a job. Judge Walther then set out to find the evidence.\n\n\n\nWith a keen eye and his camera phone — along with the help of his wife — the judge began documenting every ‘help wanted’ or ‘now hiring’ sign he could find. Each sign he saw warranted a picture. It didn’t take long for one picture to evolve into a couple dozen. Within a few weeks time, he found more than 60 places looking to hire. Many of those places were looking to hire multiple employees.\n\n\n\nEventually, the judge compiled the photos and created the Powerpoint presentation. Each slide contains the picture of the ‘help wanted’ sign, in addition to the business’ address. Then, he played it in the courtroom.\n\n\n\n“Every single person in the courtroom was watching it,\" Judge Walther said.\n\n\n\nThe display certainly caught the attention of the defendants in his courtroom. Many of them knew the excuse no longer applied.\n\n\n\n“Some people, it is laziness. Some people just don’t want to work. Some people are afraid to make changes in their life,” Judge Walther said. “Maybe for some others, they don’t understand how easy the opportunity is. I’m here to spoon-feed it to them and say, ‘Here are all the opportunities. You don’t have to go anywhere else.’”\n\n\n\nThe job opportunities run the gamut. There are positions in fast food, retail, the building trades and everywhere in between. Judge Walther said the presentation and the message behind it also applies to those who are underemployed.\n\n\n\n“Working 15 to 20 hours a week, that’s not a job. That’s a hobby,” Judge Walther said. “I would certainly hope that this would inspire them. Some of them may feel like they were forced into it. But I’m okay with that. I don’t care what their motivation is.”\n\n\n\nAccording to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, there are 18,078 child support cases with past due balances in Lorain County. Those past due balances total $150,183,414.\n\n\n\nBy having some of those defendants who owe back child support begin chiseling away at their debts, Judge Walther hopes it can help solve even more problems.\n\n\n\n“If they are not paying their child support, there is a good chance that that child is being supported by government benefits. We can take a negative and turn it into a positive,” Judge Walther said.\n\n\n\nHis approach seems to be catching on. Many citizens around the county have started sending pictures and job opening information to Judge Walther’s office. Some of the staffing agencies around the county have also started reaching out. Judge Walther said he’s even kicking around the idea of possibly hosting a job fair featuring some of those employers. In the end, it all comes down to helping out the children in his county.\n\n\n\n“I think that somebody that has a job maybe has a bit more pride in themselves because they are taking care of themselves and their children,” Judge Walther said.", "clickbait": null}

Romans 5:8” or “You are cared for! 1 Peter 5:8,” a Valentine’s Day tradition her late mother passed on to her as a child.\n\n“I love my school, but I love freedom and God more,” Olsen said. “Being in America, everyone has the constitutional right to hand out Birthday cards, Christmas cards, invitations, notes, Valentines and whatever else they want that is under protected speech without getting approval. This freedom needs to be recognized not only at NWTC, but across the country.”\n\nTen minutes after Olsen started handing out “Jesus Loves You” Valentines for fellow students, friends, and faculty in the student center on campus, security was called to stop her. A security officer took Olsen to the security office and told her “she was not allowed to hand the valentines out because school policy prohibits it,” according to the security incident report filed on February 15.\n\nNWTC officials told Olsen she was violating the school’s public assembly policy, which sets a designated space for distribution of literature, picketing or displaying protest signs – otherwise known as a “free speech zone.”\n\n“The first time the school stopped me from handing them out was in 2014, and after several months…they finally agreed to change policy and educate their staff on students’ constitutional rights,” Olsen said, but when she was reviewing policy last October, she noticed nothing had changed.\n\n“I already tried the school’s way of doing things and they lied to me,” she said.\n\nBut NWTC spokeswoman, Karen Smits, told Fox News this incident is about “record privacy.”\n\n“The Bible theme had nothing to do with being stopped,” Smits said. “If she wanted to hand out baseball cards, it would be handled the same way. She was stopped because she was ‘going into areas unannounced and uninvited that are restricted to staff members and where students are not permitted to walk freely.’ She was stopped for disrupting a work area where she did not have business.”\n\nOlsen disagrees.\n\n“If that’s the case, the week before I should’ve had security called on me because I was in the same office…and they never said anything,” Olsen said.\n\nOlsen’s lawyer, Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty president and general counsel Rick Esenberg, said regardless of whether the school is motivated by the religious content, the policy is unconstitutional.\n\n“The problem is that speech was limited to a small zone,” Esenberg said. “A public university cannot put free speech in a box.”\n\nAdam B. Steinbaugh, director of the Individual Rights Defense Program for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, told Fox News the policy “impermissibly restricts” student’s free speech rights.\n\n“Even assuming the college is correct that she was in an impermissible area, it's not clear where she could go. If she wanted to use the 'public assembly area' she would have to get permission from security, and the college bans distribution of literature with 'offensive' content,” Steinbaugh said. “What's offensive is the notion that security guards, or any other government officials, have the right to grant or deny permission to hand out pamphlets – or Valentines.”\n\nOlsen said she hands out the hearts “because of the love that God has shown is why I show it to others. When I asked Jesus to be my Lord and Savior at 4 years old, I ran and told my mom, ‘I’ve got Jesus! I’ve got Jesus,’ and I wanted the world to know about this incredible free gift,” Olsen said, adding with laughter, “and I guess I haven’t stopped.”\n\nOlsen said she just wants the school’s policy to protect freedom of speech for all students on campus.", "clickbait": null}

(As) a veteran who has been struggling with this condition for a while – since 2004 – it is amazing to see and be part of the change in mental health for veterans and their families,” said Perez, who founded the Post Traumatic Art Foundation in Puerto Rico, which offers therapy through art and music to other veterans in the community.\n\n“We have over 150,000 veterans with just one VA in Puerto Rico.

The Walk of America expedition was inspired by the vision of U.K. Expedition Patron Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex.\n\nTheir 3-month tour of the United States took them through parts of California, Texas, Colorado, Ohio, Wyoming, Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, the nation’s capital and Pennsylvania before finishing up in New York City.\n\nAlong the way they met countless veterans, who also shared their stories of the struggles they face after returning from the battlefield.\n\n“I was wounded in 2006. I lost my right eye, I lost my partner (Dan) and Jessie our driver and it wasn’t until four years later that I was diagnosed with my minor brain injury, PTSD and depression,” U.S. Air Force Master sergeant Adele Loar, who also completed the incredible journey, told Fox News. “So throughout all the time, I was battling it on my own.”\n\n105-YEAR-OLD NAVY VETERAN FINALLY GETS HIS COLLEGE DIPLOMA AFTER 83 YEARS\n\nShe said it took her a long time to figure out why she never wanted to leave the house and why she was crying all the time – “I hated people who cried and I became one of them,” she recalled.\n\n“It wasn’t until two non-profit organizations helped me understand that it was OK that I survived because for eight years I was pissed I lived,” Loar said. “Every day I swore that if there was a God I would not wake up. (And now) to come back and raise awareness that it’s OK to seek help. We are losing too many of our friends.”\n\nLoar, the only woman on the Walk of America expedition, said one of her missions during the last three months was also to remind people that there were women in combat, many of whom also returned stateside suffering from the same mental health issues as their male counterparts.\n\n“It’s not even if we’re wounded. Sometimes people forget we’re in the military,” she said. “Even along this walk, people would come up to shake the hands of the guys and turn their back to me… It was important to show that we need the same help as our male counterparts and not forget that we exist.”\n\nFor the final walk on Thursday, the team – made up of Perez, Loar, U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Larry Hinkle, Royal Logistics Corps Kev Carr, Royal Signals Kemsley Whittlesea and Royal Anglian Jonny Burns – were joined by former Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden, who were representing the Biden Foundation.\n\n“This has been an inspiration. This has been a journey of courage, love and kindness and I am so proud to have played a small role,” Dr. Biden said during remarks at the Queen Elizabeth II Memorial Garden. “Today marks the end of this walk but the work must continue. We must all play a part in raising awareness of the mental health needs of services members, veterans and their families.”\n\nShe later told Fox News that these men and woman were such an inspiration to her and her family – much like her son, Beau, who joined the military in 2003 as a member of the Delaware Army National Guard. Beau died in 2015 at the age of 46 after battling brain cancer.\n\n“We saw his strength and his resilience. All these men and women are just like my son,” Dr. Biden said. “They possess strong characters. That resilience and that grit and courage and that’s who they are. They are sharing their stories and they are so brave.”\n\nMARINE VETERAN AMPUTEE REACHES SUMMIT OF MOUNT KILIMANJARO: ‘IT’S THE CLOSEST THING TO GETTING TO HEAVEN’\n\nKev Carr, who struggled with homelessness and contemplated suicide after he was discharged from the military 14 years ago, said Walking with the Wounded saved his life. He now lives in The Beacon, a specialized veterans’ center in Catterick Garrison that helps homeless veterans or those at risk of becoming homeless. Jonny Burns also lives there.\n\n“The things I was going through – I wouldn’t wish it on anybody, civilian or military or an enemy,” he told Fox News. “It was dark. I was in a dark place. I attempted suicide, but speaking out I’ve learned that, not only does it help me, it can help others.”\n\nThe former vice president added, “It takes courage to come out and say, ‘Look, I’m battling internally, emotional problems with having to deal with what I went through. Every city they went into, you can be certain as they walked, there was a wounded warrior who was thinking, ‘if they can do this, let the whole world see it, maybe I should say I need help. I need help with my demons.”\n\nEach member of the Walk of America expedition had their own journey and story of struggle and success to share with the world. For them it was more than just raising money for the charities, but to make sure that the many times forgotten heroes – men and women – who return from the battlefield are given the help they need.\n\n“We have spent lifetimes working together, fighting alongside each other and protecting each other,” Prince Harry said in a message to the group shared on their Facebook page after they completed their walk. “And it’s people like you that we can look at ways of recovering together.

Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill waging competitive re-election fights. In a two-way contest, Donnelly leads Republican Mike Braun 49% to 43% in the Hoosier State, while McCaskill and Josh Hawley are locked in a dead heat -- each with 47% -- in the Show Me State.\n\nAnother prime target for Republicans is Florida, where Quinnipiac University found Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott running even with 49% each after some $37 million in television ads -- roughly half of that by Scott's campaign.\n\nThe Blue Wall of Great Lakes states that Trump toppled in November 2016 so far looks to be holding for Democrats in 2018. Sens. Bob Casey (Pennsylvania), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Debbie Stabenow (Michigan) and Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) are all favorites for re-election. Of that group, Baldwin appears to have the toughest race, facing a challenge from conservative state Sen. Leah Vukmir.\n\nTo be sure, the deep red states where Democratic incumbents are hoping to hang on may play to type and keep the majority out of reach for the party. But if a blue wave crests higher than expected, it could lift Democrats in states that would be all but lost in a more neutral environment.\n\nDemocrats are on offense in Nevada, a state Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points and where Rep. Jacky Rosen is now challenging GOP Sen. Dean Heller. The Battle Born State could be ground zero for the health care debate this cycle, with Rosen aggressively attacking Heller's support for the GOP's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans breathed a sigh of relief late last month when GOP Rep. Martha McSally emerged from a tough primary contest in Arizona with a convincing victory against conservative firebrands Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. But McSally's shift to the right during the nominating fight, particularly on immigration, could pose a challenge in the general against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who entered the general election largely unscathed.\n\nThe list of Democratic targets this cycle has doubled, with a pair of red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- looking increasingly competitive. With the Senate currently split 51-49 in favor of Republicans, if Democrats were able to win either of those contests -- assuming they also flip Arizona and Nevada -- it would mean the party could afford to see one of its incumbents defeated and still preserve a path to the majority.\n\nTennessee Senate: Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up\n\nIn Tennessee, former two-term Gov. Phil Bredesen is running a methodical campaign against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn by focusing on local issues and emphasizing his own moderate brand of politics over that of the national Democratic Party. That strategy seems to be working to his point, with an NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showing Bredesen and Blackburn running neck and neck -- 48% to 46% -- among likely voters.\n\nBredesen's standing is buoyed by his popularity -- 61% of likely voters have a favorable view of the Democrat versus 22% who hold a negative view of him. By comparison, 46% of likely voters view Blackburn favorably compared with 36% who do not.\n\nWhen it comes to the President, 47% approve of his job performance while 43% disapprove. Blackburn, a staunch ally of the President, is making the argument that electing Bredesen could give Democrats control of the Senate -- a persuasive message in a state that went for Trump by 26 points. Bredesen has pledged to work with the President when he proposes policies that benefit Tennessee, declaring at the start of his campaign he was not \"running against\" Trump.\n\nTexas Senate: Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican\n\nRepublicans are sending the cavalry to Texas for Sen. Ted Cruz, with the President announcing he'll do an October rally for his former 2016 GOP primary rival, and the political arm of the Club for Growth launching a seven-figure television ad campaign to hammer Cruz's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke has been a fundraising phenom, more than doubling Cruz in the second quarter and leading the GOP incumbent in cash on hand by almost $5 million. Polls show O'Rourke within striking distance of Cruz. The latest NBC News/Marist survey showed the race at 49% to 45% in Cruz's favor.\n\nFor Democrats, the path to victory in the Lone Star State has been elusive. The party's last statewide win came in 1994. The last time Texas elected a Democrat to the Senate was 1988. Clinton lost the state by nine points -- an improvement on Mitt Romney's 16-point margin over Barack Obama in 2012. Having tapped into the Democrats' enthusiasm edge, O'Rourke appears poised to narrow the gap even more this year.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nWest Virginia should be at or near the top of the GOP's targets this cycle based on Trump's 42-point margin there in 2016. The President has also visited the Mountaineer State six times since taking office.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans is they are running against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a popular two-term governor who has demonstrated a willingness to buck his party and support the President's policies and nominees. He voted for Trump's first Supreme Court selection, Neil Gorsuch, and has signaled he's open to supporting Brett Kavanaugh, saying Wednesday he has not seen anything disqualifying from the nominee during this week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Manchin also has demonstrated he can win in a less-than-ideal environment, receiving 61% of the vote in 2012 even as Romney carried the state with 62% support.\n\nRepublican nominee Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general, has faced questions about his fundraising ability and Manchin has a six-to-one cash advantage. Morrisey only recently launched his first television ad, a biographical spot that features praise from the President and highlights his legal challenge to environmental regulations implemented by the Obama administration.\n\nThat comes after Democratic outside groups have spent the summer pummeling Morrisey on TV over his work as a \"DC lobbyist\" for pharmaceutical companies and his decision to join a lawsuit challenging the ACA, a move that could lead to protections for pre-existing conditions being struck down. That line of attack could resonate in West Virginia, which at 36% has the highest rate of adults under 65 with pre-existing conditions, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2016.\n\nNorth Dakota Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Republican\n\nOne state where Republicans are increasingly bullish about their chances is North Dakota, where GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a state the President carried by 36 points. Trump was personally involved in the effort to recruit Cramer into the race and stumped for the three-term GOP lawmaker Friday night in Fargo.\n\nFor a while it appeared Heitkamp was Trump's favorite Senate Democrat. The President praised her as a \"good woman\" during a September 2017 event in the Peace Garden State and invited her to the White House in May for the signing of a bank deregulation bill she co-sponsored.\n\nNow it seems the President is all-in for Cramer. \"You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota, but votes like they're from North Dakota. That's what you need, and that's Kevin Cramer,\" Trump said during a Fargo rally in late June.\n\nHeitkamp should be able to keep the race close because of her strong personal brand and resource advantage -- leading Cramer $5.2 to $2.4 million in cash on hand. Cramer's bottom line should get a boost thanks to the President's visit, which his campaign says raised over $1 million.\n\nDemocrats are attacking Cramer on health care, accusing him of voting to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and trade policy, a particularly acute concern in agriculture-rich North Dakota. Republicans, meanwhile, are targeting Heitkamp on hot-button issues such as abortion and so-called sanctuary cities, as well as her vote against the GOP tax cuts.\n\nGiven Trump's popularity in the state, Cramer's unwavering support for the President could be a more potent pitch to voters than Heitkamp's message of moderation. The national environment this year favors Democrats, but North Dakota is very much Trump country -- and Cramer is Trump's candidate.\n\nNew Jersey Senate: Race moves from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since New Jersey voters elected a Republican to the Senate.\n\nBob Hugin is a longshot to break that streak, but the pharmaceutical executive is giving Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez a serious challenge in the Garden State. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Hugin trailing Menendez by six points in a state Clinton won by 14 points in 2016 and Obama carried by 17 points four years earlier.\n\nThe federal corruption trial involving Menendez ended last November in a mistrial, but an ethical cloud continues to hang over the Democrat. Nearly half of New Jersey voters say Menendez was involved in serious wrongdoing, including 38% of Democrats.\n\nDemocratic primary voters in the state delivered a clear message to Menendez in June when little-known challenger Lisa McCormick drew 38% of the vote against the two-term incumbent. Still, Menendez received more votes than were cast in the GOP primary, which Hugin won with 75% support.\n\nHugin has loaned his campaign more than $15 million and has spent more than $7 million on television ads to boost his candidacy. Menendez has been saving his resources -- holding about $6.4 million cash on hand. He's also getting a little help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which recently teamed with Menendez on a joint television ad buy. Democrats feel confident Menendez's numbers will improve once he hits the airwaves. He also stands to benefit from several competitive House races in a state where Democrats have strong recruits.", "clickbait": null}

Bush, no friend to Trump, who will join Scott at two fundraisers for a super PAC backing Scott’s Senate campaign Friday. It’s the latest instance of the Florida governor visibly tying his political fortunes to a prominent Republican other than the current president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nScott — who was frequently by Trump’s side at the White House and at his resorts in Palm Beach and Bedminster, New Jersey, in 2017 — began putting more distance between himself and the unpopular president this year as he geared up for a Senate run that Trump himself had repeatedly urged him to make. Scott also chaired the super PAC backing Trump’s 2016 presidential bid.\n\nNow Scott seldom mentions the president and won’t commit to having an event with him specifically.\n\n“I want everybody that believes in what I'm going to do to come help me win,” Scott told a Tampa Bay Times reporter last week when asked if he would like having Trump campaign for him.\n\nScott made the remarks in advance of a fundraiser headlined for him by Vice President Mike Pence. Scott skipped a July 31 Trump rally for GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis’ campaign for governor. In April, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Cory Gardner, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, also fundraised for Scott .\n\nScott isn’t completely snubbing the president. He flew down from Washington on Air Force One to Tampa with Trump in July and then accompanied Trump to an official presidential visit to Tampa Technical High School — an event where their exposure to TV cameras was limited.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIn contrast to his closeness to Trump in 2017, Scott’s distance from the president this year as the midterm election comes into focus provides a glimpse into Trump’s standing in the nation’s largest swing state, which he won by just 1.2 percentage points.\n\nCompared to his underwater national polling average, Trump is more popular in Florida — but that’s not saying much. His net favorability rating is still a negative 4 points in Florida (and negative 16 points nationally) according to Quinnipiac University’s polling.\n\nQuinnipiac’s poll showed Scott is tied with Sen. Bill Nelson at 49 percent each.\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, has no choice but to stick by Trump, whose endorsement and full-throated support for the congressman helped him beat a once better-known and better-funded GOP rival, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.\n\n“Rick is doing what a sensible Republican should do — if he’s in a position to be able to do it, and Ron DeSantis isn’t in that position,” said a top Florida Republican who received the invite for the New Republican PAC events headlined by Bush. “This isn’t an F-you to Trump. But the president might see it as such.”\n\nIn a written statement, Scott’s campaign said the governor “is glad to accept the support of President Bush, Vice President Pence, and anyone who shares his views that we need to reform Washington. The governor appreciated the president endorsing his race when he came to Tampa in July.”\n\nAnother Republican familiar with the political operations of both Trump and Scott said it’s a “keep-away-from-Trump strategy. But Scott doesn’t want to be in-you-face about it. And you never know: He could announce a fundraiser tomorrow.”\n\nThe Friday fundraiser is separated into two parts: a 11:00 am private meeting at $25,000 a pop in Tampa and a reception in Palm Beach at 3:30 on the same day at $50,000 a pop.\n\nWith an eye on the November elections, Scott has also put modest distance between himself and the president in terms of criticizing Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policies that led to family separations at the border. Scott also moved more to the center by signing the first-ever gun control legislation passed in Tallahassee under Republican rule.\n\nThe Florida governor has long ties to Bush. Scott was once a minority partner with Bush in owning the Texas Rangers baseball team, which was sold to billionaire Tom Hicks, whose son and namesake is the chair of the New Republican PAC for which the president is fundraising.\n\nFew presidents know what it’s like to manage Florida Republicans during a midterm like Bush.\n\nIn 2002, Bush had no trouble at all attracting Republican support here and was sought-after as a surrogate as the country was united behind him after 9/11. His brother, Jeb, ran successfully that year for reelection to the second of his two terms.\n\nBut 2006 was another story. With the burden of the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina response weighing on the Bush presidency, Republican candidate for governor Charlie Crist skipped a Pensacola event with the president on the way to resounding win. Jeb Bush went in Crist’s place and wasn’t happy with Crist’s snub.\n\nAt the time, then-Senate candidate Katherine Harris was clamoring for help from Bush but the president, whose White House had expressed displeasure with Harris’s chaotic campaign and longshot chances, declined as she lost big to Sen. Nelson during his first reelection.\n\nNow Nelson, who has had relatively weak opponents, faces his toughest challenge ever from Scott.\n\nDaniel Strauss contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct McConnell's title.", "clickbait": null}

He’s stuck with a long incumbency, and he’s stuck with a short general election,” said Tom Russell, a Wisconsin-based consultant with the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nThe signs that Walker is ripe to be taken down are everywhere. His opponent, Schools Superintendent Tony Evers, has a slight lead in recent polls and there’s evidence that critical suburban voters are shifting leftward.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThree former Walker aides have even turned on the governor, with two cutting ads for Evers. And Walker has quickly gone negative on Evers, including in a new, highly-charged ad .\n\nJust as important, Democrats are running a populist candidate they believe is made for the moment — Evers, who built momentum from decisively winning a crowded primary and went on to raise $1 million in his first week as the nominee.\n\nA career educator, Evers presents a crisp contrast with Walker, who’s held elected office for more than two decades. Democrats have seized on a “Walker fatigue” message that blames him for a teacher shortage, deteriorating roads (“Scottholes” as one group calls them ) and rising health care costs.\n\nThe governor’s real soft spot in his bid for a third term, however, might be his 2016 run for president. His detractors hold it up as evidence that Walker is more concerned about his political ambition than the people of Wisconsin. TV ads are already panning Walker’s White House run, saying he can’t be trusted to stick around for a full four-year term.\n\nIt clearly hits a nerve with Walker.\n\nConcluding a statewide fly around in Waukesha on the first day of the general election campaign last month, Walker began moving away from a press scrum, taking no further questions. But when asked whether the people of Wisconsin could trust he was committed to a full term as governor, given his 2016 presidential run, Walker stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n“Tony Evers ran for superintendent for a four-year term and a year after, he’s running for governor. You ask him the same question?” Walker asked a reporter, pointing to the reporter’s voice recorder, then pressing: “That’s on the record, right? You’re going to ask him the same question?” (POLITICO later asked Evers’ campaign; the answer was “yes.”)\n\nWalker then responded directly about his intentions.\n\n“Of course, 100 percent. I’m running for governor, I’m going to be here for four years,” Walker said, noting he went on a statewide listening tour after he gave up his presidential ambitions. “I came back and did listening sessions in all 72 counties. It’s what influenced our budget, the changes we made in education … it all came out of us going right back to the roots.”\n\n“A lot of people have said I could have easily gone on and done something else. I could have joined the Cabinet, could have joined the public sector,” Walker said. “But instead, I’m committed to being governor.”\n\nFor all the storm clouds surrounding Walker’s prospects, few in either party are willing to write him off. As he runs for a third term, his job approval ratings remain in a fairly narrow band , never dropping too low or soaring too high.\n\nHe’s also cash-flush, given the $8.6 million Walker and the state party reported in the bank in July. On top of that, the Republican Governors Association is expected to invest $5.7 million in preserving Walker’s governorship. Walker can boast of a healthy state economy and an unemployment rate that stands at 2.9 percent — he paints Evers as beholden to unions and says an Evers victory would mean higher taxes and would stall that humming economy.\n\nWalker’s durability and resilience — he’s been running and winning tough elections since his early 20s — inspires confidence among Republicans. He’s the last man standing among a Wisconsin GOP triumvirate who ascended to national prominence in the Obama era only to see their fortunes sputter during the Trump presidency.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is not running for reelection; Reince Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chair, was ousted from his position as White House chief of staff after a chaotic six months.\n\n“I don’t think anybody thinks that this is isn’t going to be the most competitive governor’s race in the country,\" said Brandon Scholz, a Republican strategist and former Wisconsin GOP party executive director.\n\nScholz said one of Walker’s greatest assets is the strength of a Republican statewide organization that he helped build. “You see how hard Walker’s working: he’s an 8-event-a-day kind of guy. He’s always been a workhorse, all the time. He’s ramped it up even more.”\n\nRepublicans contend the Walker political machine, which features a tested field strategy and foot soldiers already in place, will combat those outside forces. They point to the contested Aug. 14 GOP Senate primary, where Leah Vukmir was vastly outspent but still defeated Kevin Nicholson. Walker didn’t endorse in the race, but his son, Alex, served as Vukmir’s political director and the GOP party apparatus went all in for her.\n\n“The fact that she won shows that the Walker organization is as powerful today as it was in 2016 when it was mobilized on behalf of Ted Cruz,” said Republican pollster Chris Wilson, who ran analytics for Nicholson’s campaign, referring to Cruz’s resounding victory over Trump in the Wisconsin presidential primary. “The only area I can speak to with any level of authority is we got our ass kicked by a ground game — a grassroots Walker organization — that will be just as energized in November.”\n\nThe import of Wisconsin’s governor’s race is not lost on either party. Toppling Walker, long a symbol of anti-union and conservative policies, would deliver an emotional windfall to the left and serve to shore up a pivotal swing state for Democrats in the runup to 2020.\n\nFor Republicans, beating back Democratic enthusiasm in a key Midwestern state Trump unexpectedly won by less than 25,000 votes in 2016, would hold just as much significance.\n\nThey expect Evers, first elected statewide as superintendent in 2009, will be at a spending disadvantage against Walker, who’s stockpiled a greater cash reserve than he did at this point in 2014.\n\nBut the cavalry is coming for Evers. The Democratic Governors Association has already committed at least $3.8 million, while other major groups expected to give resources to Evers’ campaign include former Attorney General Eric Holder’s redistricting committee, Obama’s Organizing for Action, Tom Steyer’s NextGen America and the Democratic National Committee.\n\n“I don’t think this is about Democratic enthusiasm in Madison and Milwaukee, it’s about Democratic enthusiasm and a backlash to Trump and Walker everywhere in Wisconsin,” said Sachin Chheda, a Democratic strategist and former Milwaukee County party chair.\n\nChheda points to “a massive shift to the left” in what was once solid Walker territory — including special elections in Green Bay’s Brown County and in the Twin Cities suburbs in St. Croix County.\n\nDemocrats also cite three public polls in recent weeks — NBC/Marist , Marquette and Suffolk/Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel — show independent voters are breaking from Walker, a daunting signal given that the state is almost evenly split politically, making them an essential part of the governor’s path to victory.\n\n“What all of those polls said is that independents are going for Evers over Walker by 10 points. Walker has generally won independents when he’s gotten to victory,” Chheda said.\n\nWhile Walker is expected to again win the vote-rich, GOP suburban counties outside of Milwaukee — he dominates in the so-called “WOW” counties where turnout is high — Chheda said if Democrats can nibble at the margins, it would make it much more difficult for Walker to win statewide.\n\nThe Trump factor could play a role in those suburbs. Even Republicans admit Trump’s unfiltered rants on social media and a slew of scandals hitting his inner circle could prompt GOP voters to stay home in November, including those heartened by Trump’s policies on immigration and taxes.\n\n“This guy just says and does things that make you recoil,” Scholz, the Republican consultant, said of Trump. “The balancing test there is: OK, you’ve had victories on issues that you’ve long wanted, but the guy doing them makes you want to throw up in your mouth. What do you do? Do you stay home and not vote? Or do you vote for the folks on the ticket, to make sure that what goes on for Republicans and conservatives, and what goes on in the state capitol is what you want?”\n\nOne stat with which both parties can agree is the direction rural voters are leaning, and that’s with Walker. Rural Wisconsin counties with populations of 10,000 people or less have long held steady for Walker, and neither side believes that’ll change in November.\n\n“Scott Walker and Wisconsin Republicans have earned the support of hard-working families in rural parts of the state because they've stood up for them and delivered results,” Walker senior campaign advisor Brian Reisinger said. “Democrats lost touch with those voters a long time ago, and they're not likely to win them back.”", "clickbait": null}

That’s my main takeaway from reading 20 Bob Woodward books in the past four weeks. No one can beat Woodward at getting the story of the White House from the inside, from the perspective of the decision makers as they saw themselves. People tell Woodward things they shouldn’t, from the alarming (Trump aides swiping memos from his desk) to the mundane (Nixon trying to gnaw open a childproof cap on a pill bottle with his teeth). He may be the sole practitioner of a form that occupies a space between journalism and history, one that tries to balance immediacy with detail. When he’s onto a good story—the resignation of a president, Iran-Contra, America’s post-9/11 wars—there’s no one better, or at least no one better who’s faster.\n\nI began reading and ranking every freaking Woodward book—all of 20 of them; that’s almost 10,000 pages—when Fear, the new book about President Donald Trump, was announced last month. I read four on vacation in mid-August, then four more the next week, and then five more, and seven more. I learned a lot, even as I learned that not all palace intrigue is intriguing.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhy did I do it? Was it to uncover how the presidency has changed since Watergate? To prove that I could? So that you wouldn’t have to? All of the above. Still, I wouldn’t do it again, and neither should anybody else.\n\nPolitico Magazine acquired a copy of Fear this week, and I’ve read it. So here we go:\n\n\n\n***\n\n20. The Man Who Would Be President\n\nIt’s not quite accurate to say that I read this book, though I did turn every page. Co-written by David Broder, it’s a collection of articles, first published in The Washington Post during the buildup to the 1992 campaign, about Vice President Dan Quayle. Either Woodward or his publicist has banished the book from his website, which contains a lengthy description—and purchase button—for every other title that put his name on a dust jacket. Eighteen—soon to be 19—books, it says, and 12 No.1 bestsellers! But what about No. 20?\n\nSome Woodward acolytes argue that The Man Who Would Be President isn’t a book, because it was conceived and published as a newspaper series. You know, I’m looking at it right now, and it’s a book. It has pages and everything. Chapter 6 is titled, “The Vice President’s Driving Passion: Quayle Unleashes Competitive Energy on the Golf Course.” Woodward delights in uncovering details that presidents and senior administration figures have scrubbed from their official histories and omitted from their memoirs. Sorry, Bob. I found your smoking gun.\n\n19. The Price of Politics\n\nEver since State of Denial, his third book about the George W. Bush administration, Woodward has fashioned himself as much an analyst of the presidency as a just-the-facts conduit of White House secrets, gossip and intrigue. The Price of Politics cements this ascension from Washington Post cops reporter to D.C. eminence by opening with a first-person anecdote from the Gridiron Club dinner, one that condemns Barack Obama, then a newly elected senator from Illinois, as an inexperienced narcissist.\n\nAlas, then Woodward recedes from the story, a deadeningly thorough chronicle of the debt-ceiling negotiations between Barack Obama and John Boehner. Would I have been kinder to this book if it hadn’t been the 18th Bob Woodward book I read in the past four weeks? Maybe! But Michiko Kakutani called The Price of Politics “often tedious” when she reviewed it for the New York Times. Writing in the home turf of Woodward’s Washington Post, Jeff Shesol concurred, “If the hallmark of a Bob Woodward book is that it puts you in the room, you may well, before long, start clawing for the exits.”\n\nOr, as Woodward writes in the final paragraph, “There was so much effort, most of it sincere, but so little result.” He means the budget negotiations. I think.\n\n18. Obama’s Wars\n\nIt could be that No-Drama Obama just made for low-drama Woodward. There’s little that Woodward appears to enjoy more than quoting some presidential cursing, but no matter how impatient Obama gets with his generals in this account of his Afghanistan policy, POTUS stays PG-rated. “I’m pissed” is as profane as it gets, but even then “he didn’t raise his voice much.” (In The Price of Politics, Obama does tell some Democrats, “Stop this bullshit,” but still, Woodward says the president was only “close to losing his temper.”) At another moment, the best a frustrated Obama can muster is, “This presentation strains credulity.”\n\nIn both books, Obama is damaged by his distaste for politics and his newness to Washington. When Obama chooses Jim Jones as his national security adviser, Woodward writes, “He seemed to have reached the baffling conclusion that the lack of a personal relationship could be an asset.” John Podesta was “not sure,” Woodward adds, “that Obama felt anything, especially in his gut.” Instead, the president “intellectualized … essentially picking up the emotions of others and translating them into ideas.”\n\nBest anecdote: Richard Holbrooke, the newly appointed special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, invites the Pakistani ambassador to lunch at the Hay-Adams Hotel. Holbrooke insists on a public location “so it gets reported in the newspaper.” No one notices.\n\n17. Plan of Attack\n\nWhen the first Iraq war ended in 1991, there was a lot of talk about the end of America’s lingering “Vietnam syndrome.” By the time the second Iraq war began a decade later, Vietnam syndrome had been replaced by Gulf War syndrome, a national assumption that war could be brief, sterile and free of sacrifice. Plan of Attack is Woodward’s first, and definitely not last (he wrote four Bush at War books, amounting to more than 2,000 pages in eight years) stab at explaining what happened next.\n\nIt was heralded as Woodward’s comeback when it was published, but to my eye it’s the least of his four George W. Bush books. Plan of Attack is all war planning, but very little war, and it lacks the novelistic intimacy of Woodward’s best work. The tidbits that got Washington tittering 14 years ago (Colin Powell’s “Pottery Barn rule,” George Tenet’s “slam dunk,” Bush’s invocation of a “higher Father” than his dad) remain, and Plan of Attack is an important document of how and why the United States invaded with too few troops to win the peace (see: Donald Rumsfeld). But the characters in that drama are more vividly painted in Bush at War, and the consequences aren’t fully revealed until State of Denial and The War Within, which in many ways feel like Woodward’s attempts at a Plan of Attack do-over.\n\nUnderappreciated anecdote: The CIA floods Kurdistan with so many Benjamins to pay its sources that everything, “even a cup of coffee,” starts to cost $100.\n\n16. Maestro\n\nLike Plan of Attack, Woodward’s story of how Alan Greenspan helped create the prosperity of the 1990s feels like half a book. Unlike Plan of Attack, we never get the sequel, or the revision. There’s little about the asset bubbles—in stocks and in housing—whose bursting would define the next decade of economic policymaking, other than Greenspan’s uncertainty as to whether there’s anything he can safely do about them. This book, in short, could use some Ben Bernanke. (Janet Yellen, who was a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 1994 to 1997, does pop up now and again to fret that Greenspan isn’t putting on the brakes.) Still, we get an inside account of Greenspan’s Fed and its decision-making, not to mention his mastery of Washington schmoozing.\n\nMemorable anecdote: When Greenspan asked Andrea Mitchell to marry him, his proposal was so opaque that “either she had not understood what he was saying or it had failed to register”—on two different occasions.\n\n15. The Brethren\n\nWoodward’s first book after The Final Days, co-written with Scott Armstrong, begins as SCOTUS for Dummies: “The United States Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, is the final forum for appeal in the American judiciary.” While Woodward and Armstrong’s infiltration of the cloistered realm of justices and their clerks is impressive, the result reads like a collection of chronological anecdotes from the Burger Court, with little attempt to weigh their importance or meaning. Even so, anyone who thinks the Supreme Court wasn’t political in the 1970s will have their illusions dashed by reading about the vote-trading and logrolling in this book. And the deliberations over the Nixon tapes are like the second half of the political Law & Order episode that began in All the President’s Men.\n\nWoodward and Armstrong also gleefully track the Court’s struggles to define obscenity (“no erections and no insertions,” Byron White concludes at one point, and William Brennan’s clerks also apply what they call a “limp dick” standard: “Oral sex was tolerable if there was no erection”). The “humorous high point of most terms” was “movie day,” when justices and clerks watch the pornos under consideration in obscenity appeals.\n\nPossibly the most current sentences in the book: “It was only recently that activism on the Court had become ‘liberal’ activism, Rehnquist reminded them. Only forty years before, the Court’s activists were conservatives. The balance was once again shifting back, Rehnquist said. Once it had, liberals would be the ones calling for judicial restraint and chiding the conservatives for ignoring precedent.”\n\n14. Fear\n\nDonald Trump makes for pretty good copy, even if Woodward hasn’t turned up all that much—or at least all that much beyond the book’s jaw-dropping prologue, in which Gary Cohn lifts a document (an order to withdraw from a trade agreement with South Korea that Trump was about to sign) from the president’s desk. The theme, beyond Trump’s ignorance and dishonesty, is that the deep state is real: An “administrative coup d’état” has been carried out by Trump’s Cabinet and staff to contradict the president’s constitutional authority. For instance, when Trump tells James Mattis, “Let’s go in; let’s kill the fucking lot of them” after a Syrian chemical attack, Mattis hangs up and tells an aide, “We’re not going to do any of that.”\n\nIt’s also just super dishy. Trump says H.R. McMaster dresses like a “beer salesman.” Jared Kushner tells Steve Bannon of his father-in-law, “He doesn’t have a lot of cash.” Trump asks Kellyanne Conway, before offering her the job as his campaign manager, “Are you willing to not see your kids for a few months?” We go deep inside the Rex Tillerson “fucking moron” meeting at the Pentagon. An image of Trump’s handwriting—the words “TRADE IS BAD” on a speech he’s revising—is reproduced.\n\nAt the same time, you can tell that this one was put together on deadline. Woodward’s books are often most interesting when he inserts himself as a character and reveals his reportorial decision-making and the Post’s newsroom deliberations alongside the White House dope. In Fear, those moments of journalistic drama are replaced with moments in which Woodward reveals observations he made during his appearances on Fox News Sunday.\n\n13. The Agenda\n\nWhen I first read this book almost 25 years ago, I loved it. Clinton’s purple rages! Long-term interest rates! A surprise cameo by Atul Gawande!\n\nOK, I only noticed the Gawande cameo upon rereading it. We’ve got all the materials here for a great Woodward book—characters who are still historically important, and in ways (like Hillary Clinton) that weren’t fully grasped at the time. But while the passage of Clinton’s deficit-reduction plan in his first year in office was undeniably important, from the perspective of 2018 it feels like an odd choice for a book about Bill Clinton (not that Woodward could have known that in 1994). Also, there’s way too much David Boren.\n\nStill, The Agenda begins with a strikingly intimate scene, with Hillary and Bill Clinton seemingly in bed on an Arkansas morning in 1991, discussing why now is the time for Bill to run for the presidency. He describes James Carville nicely (“a bald, pointy head and riveting, almost sinister eyes”). There’s Quality Cursing (Bill Clinton: “You mean to tell me that the success of the program and my reelection hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders?”). The climax is striking, as Warren Buffett calls Bob Kerrey, the Democratic senator from Nebraska, to recommend that he vote for Clinton’s deficit-reduction plan.\n\nFrom a post-presidential viewpoint, here’s the most memorable quote in The Agenda: “If I don’t get health care done,” Clinton says, “I’ll wish I didn’t run for president.”\n\n12. The Commanders\n\nThis Bush at War prequel feels like the first time Woodward settled on the form he describes as “somewhere between newspaper journalism and history.” He set out to write a book about the Pentagon, presumably one that would resemble Veil, his book about the Central Intelligence Agency. The invasions of Panama and Iraq changed his approach, and his deadline. The main characters are Dick Cheney, then the defense secretary, and Colin Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the knowledge that the two men will be linked again in 20 years adds to the story’s salience.\n\n“This book is not about most of the things the military does,” Woodward writes of his method. “It is not about weapons procurement, defense budget fights, recruiting, training or military field exercises. With a few brief exceptions, it does not touch on the way the military has actually fought the wars of the last few years. It will not take you into the helicopters descending on Panama City, or to the desert tank battles in Iraq and Kuwait. It is above all a book about how the United States decides to fight its wars before shots are fired. The main setting is Washington, and the main action is the tug-and-pull among the players in the military decision-making process, both inside and outside the Pentagon.”\n\n11. The Last of the President’s Men\n\nA memoir of Alexander Butterfield, the Nixon aide who disclosed the existence of the president’s Oval Office taping system to the Senate Watergate Committee, this book is most notable for documenting what a weirdo Nixon was.\n\nIt also includes Woodward’s favorite Nixon White House anecdote, which appears in multiple books: Staff assistants in the Nixon White House were called “Higbys,” after Larry Higby, chief of staff H.R. Haldeman’s executive assistant. Eventually, Higby gets his own Higby, who becomes known as “Higby’s Higby.”\n\nButterfield is essentially hired as “Haldeman’s Haldeman,” but spends his early days hiding from Nixon, who is so introverted he won’t look at or speak to Butterfield for days. “If the president comes in, you just walk out,” Haldeman tells Butterfield. “It’ll spook him if he sees you.”\n\nIn an echo of a moment in All the President’s Men, Woodward calls Henry Kissinger at one point to talk about a Nixon memo acknowledging years of bombing “failure” in Southeast Asia. “That is true,” Kissinger says, before adding, “Now, you’re not going to quote me on this, are you?”\n\nWoodward writes, “Yes, I said I would.”\n\n10. Wired\n\nA book about comedy, drugs and rock ’n’ roll by an author who seems to understand none of them. Three decades later, Woodward’s idea of an au courant pop-culture reference is still Dynasty (in Fear) or Columbo (in The War Within). Woodward now describes Wired as a book about “the Hollywood drug culture,” and that’s probably a more accurate description of it than a biography of John Belushi, even if Belushi’s life is the window into that culture. A reader of Wired might wonder if Belushi was ever funny or charming, or why people kept hiring him—at Second City, on Saturday Night Live, for movies like Animal House and The Blues Brothers—if he was so unreliable and unpleasant to work with. You start to understand why, say, Nixon’s admirers resent the attention paid to Watergate at the exclusion of all else. But as a chronicle of one man’s addiction, with lots of bold-faced names—Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro are in the story of the night of Belushi’s death—this is quite a read.\n\n9. The War Within\n\nThe fourth Bush at War book could use more Dick Cheney. And like Shakespeare, Woodward’s tragedies tend to be better than the comedies. This one doesn’t end with a marriage, but it’s the best good-news Woodward book, the story of how David Petraeus and George W. Bush salvaged the Iraq war with the “surge” from 2006 to 2008.\n\nYet Woodward also uses this book to meditate on why the war went so wrong for so long. “The president and his team had become marketers of Bush’s certainty,” he writes. Rumsfeld sits in his office “trying to control the world through his snowflakes,” his short and constant Pentagon memos. Rummy seems to think that war is like welfare, that too much American security will “create a dependency among the Iraqis.” Colin Powell unloads for 20 minutes on the Iraq Study Group about the war-planning mistakes of Gen. Tommy Franks.\n\nWoodward writes, with unusual directness, “I have never doubted the sincerity of the president’s convictions. But convictions alone are not enough.” He concludes that Bush spent “three years in denial” about the Iraq war, that he was “intolerant” of confrontation and debate, and that he “engaged in the war rhetorically but maintained an odd detachment from its management.”\n\n8. The Secret Man\n\nThis is minor Woodward, but it’s incredibly enjoyable. Much of the first half reads like the footnotes to All the President’s Men. But it’s also the closest thing Woodward has written to a memoir, beginning with his first meeting with Mark Felt in the White House when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant. He discloses when he broke the rules of his agreement with Felt, including when he described him as “Deep Throat” in All the President’s Men. He admits to lying to a Post colleague, Richard Cohen, to wave him off the scent when Cohen was about to publish a column nailing Felt as Woodward’s source. It’s probably the best window we have into who Woodward is as a person and how he thinks. Plus, Nixon seems extra-weird—if not quite as weird as in The Last of the President’s Men—and Woodward quotes Kant.\n\n7. Shadow\n\nRichard Nixon is the Kilgore Trout of the Woodward literary corpus, a recurring character who just keeps showing up. In Shadow, Woodward looks at how Watergate—especially special prosecutors and independent counsels—affected the five presidents after Nixon, from Ford to Clinton. The Watergate metaphor is strained at times, and Woodward underplays the legacy of Gary Hart in the presidency of Bill Clinton, but there are lots of good stories here, including the time Jimmy Carter lied to Woodward and Ben Bradlee, and a powerfully sad post-presidential deposition of Ronald Reagan, who can’t remember anything and says, “It’s like I wasn’t president at all.”\n\n6. State of Denial\n\nA merciless recounting of the postwar planning—and lack thereof—undertaken by Donald Rumsfeld’s Pentagon, as well as a fuller chronicle of George W. Bush’s rise and fall. The four Bush at War books repeat some material, even sentences and what feel like paragraphs. You get the feeling that just as the administration kept trying to get the war right, Woodward kept returning to the story, trying to get a fuller, more complete picture. In the end, he wrote three books just on Iraq—Plan of Attack, State of Denial, and The War Within. This is the story’s second act, when everything looks as bad as it will ever get. It’s The Empire Strikes Back of Woodward’s Iraq trilogy.\n\n5. The Choice\n\nDisclosure: I’m from Kansas. The pleasure of recognition I get when Bob Dole says “Jiminy” (my dad would say “Jiminy Cricket”), or when he uses “visit” as a verb that means “sit and talk,” may lead you not to trust me on the merits of The Choice. This is the book, after all, that inspired Joan Didion to fillet Woodward in the New York Review of Books as a writer of “political pornography,” of “books in which memorable cerebral activity is virtually absent.”\n\nIf The Choice is pornography, all right then I’ll go to hell. If this book were written by Michael Lewis or Mark Leibovich, it would be regarded as a campaign classic. Hillary Clinton communes with Eleanor Roosevelt in the White House, and Bob Dole spends so much time talking to Woodward that even Woodward runs out of questions. Joe Lieberman (!) describes the arrival of Dick Morris in the White House as an “act of God” that will save the Democratic Party. And the cast includes not just Clinton and Dole but important later figures like Cheney, Powell and Hillary Clinton. George Will comes across as the George Conway of the 1990s, writing a column titled “Good Man … Wrong Job?” about Dole, the candidate for whom his wife, Mari, works as an adviser and speechwriter.\n\nYou should know there’s basically nothing about Ken Starr or Whitewater. You have to read Shadow for that. The only time the word “blowjob” appears in a book that covers the period when Bill Clinton met an intern in the Oval Office is when Scott Reed, Dole’s campaign manager, complains about Colin Powell getting “blowjob interviews” from the press.\n\n4. Veil\n\nLike The Brethren, Veil is very disconnected, bouncing from Nicaragua to Lebanon to Russia to Libya, but it’s tied together by the person of Ronald Reagan’s CIA director, Bill Casey, and the backdrop of Iran-Contra—as well as the reader’s knowledge that 9/11 is coming, which recontextualizes many of the events in the Middle East. As with All the President’s Men, Woodward is a character in the drama, and Ben Bradlee shows up, too, as the two journalists clash with Casey on what should be reported and when.\n\nWhen this book came out, some were skeptical that Woodward actually snuck into Casey’s hospital bed for a final interview—a near-deathbed confession that pays off much better than the interview he seeks with a dying Mark Felt, who suffers from dementia, in The Secret Man. I’ve read too much Woodward by now to be skeptical. Like Casey, “I believed.”\n\n3. Bush at War\n\nMy recollection of the reception of this book about the first 100 days after 9/11—a reputation that Woodward gets modestly defensive about in The War Within—is that it was a puff piece. But reading it now, George W. Bush comes off as the same president he is in the sequels: resolute but impatient and uninformed, with an administration riven by a conflict between Powell and Rumsfeld, who begins agitating for war with Iraq from the very start. This is my vote for “the best since The Final Days,” a riveting, novelistic account of a crucial moment in history. Is it the whole story? Of course not. It is, as Woodward concedes, “an inside account, largely the story as the insiders saw it, heard it and lived it.” Still, needs more Cheney.\n\n2. The Final Days\n\nThere’s a reason reviewers so often seem to be proclaiming that the latest Woodward book is “his best since The Final Days.” This book, the second of the two that were co-written by Carl Bernstein, is fantastic, the model for all that came after. Also, it helps that it’s about the only president to resign. As we said at the outset, if you’re going to be a fly, it helps to have a good wall.\n\nPlus, the ending now reads like a post-credits scene for the beginning of the rest of the Woodward cinematic universe, as newly minted President Gerald Ford writes one word on a memo, recommending his new chief of staff: “Rumsfeld.”\n\n1. All the President’s Men\n\nIt opens like a thriller, with burglars in a courtroom—one of whom soon discloses that he works for the CIA. All the President’s Men is a true crime story and also a newsroom drama, and the knowledge that Mark Felt was Deep Throat makes the book more interesting, not less, as it makes it easier to weigh Felt’s knowledge and his motivations. The elimination of what used to be the book’s central mystery also shifts the reader’s focus from Who Is Deep Throat? to Holy Cow, Two Metro Reporters Are Taking Down a President. The first, and still the best. This one I’d read again.", "clickbait": null}

I mean, it’s real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the market place. ’Course don’t ever tell anybody that they’re not free, ’cause then they’re gunna get real busy killing and maiming to prove to you that they are. Oh yeah they’re gunna talk to you and talk to you and talk to you about individual freedom. But they see a free individual, it’s gunna scare ’em.”\n\nThis past weekend at Harley-Davidson’s 115th anniversary celebration, which drew roughly 150,000 bikers to events across Milwaukee, the strains of Easy Rider were still in the air. Nearly a half-century after the film’s debut, the motorcycle remains a symbol of freedom—a way into a world apart from the world, a world that’s freer, more primal, more alive. But today, there’s at least one new development: For many in the crowd, motorcycle culture translates to a full-fledged embrace of President Donald Trump, who they say embodies the same rebellious spirit. They defended the commander in chief, despite—or perhaps even because of—his public spat with their favored brand.\n\nAt Harley’s global headquarters, where bikers stopped for photos amidst their tours of the city, the word “FREEDOM” greets visitors as they enter, cut out of steel in seven-foot letters. Behind the reception desk are more cutouts: “MUSCLE” and “ReBEL” are the largest and most prominent, with “FREEDOM” and “BELONGING” bridging the gap between them. In a conference room where bikers mill about, a paragraph made to look like an American flag adorns the wall. “We don’t do fear,” it says, adding later, “Freedom and wind outlast hard times. And the rumble of an engine drowns out all the blah, blah, blah on the evening news.”\n\nIn Harleys, somehow rebellion and patriotism fuse together. The flag and the military loom large in the festivities. At the anniversary kickoff, three paratroopers jump from a Vietnam-era helicopter while a company spokesman reminds the assembled bikers that they are standing in Milwaukee’s Veterans Park. “That’s America right there, that’s incredible,” he says as the soldiers drift down with a giant flag, thanking them “for being the badasses that you are.” “We’re going to sing the national anthem, ladies and gentlemen,” the spokesman says when the soldiers are safely on the ground, “because again, we are celebrating America right along with this incredible American brand.”\n\nAfter the ceremony, I talk with Jerry Bellin, 60, a retired union ironworker who rode 90 miles here from his Wisconsin home. A long white beard extends down Bellin’s face beneath a confederate battle flag bandana. He wears the bandana, he says, because “it’s a rebel thing,” though he also says he wears it simply because a former tenant abandoned it amongst debris at an apartment he owns. The same word comes up when Bellin talks about the president. “He ran as a Republican, but I just like the rebel-ism,” he says.\n\nBellin shrugs off the president’s spat with Harley. Earlier this summer, Harley announced it would expand overseas production in order to evade E.U. tariffs levied as retaliation against Trump’s tariffs on steel. In a mid-August Twitter post, the president encouraged a boycott of the company. “Other countries do it to us,” Bellin says, referring to tariffs. “And we should protect ourselves. Without being racist or anything, but you see all the Asian people here? Look what kind of car they’re driving. They’re driving all Toyotas and Hondas and stuff. They protect their own country, even though they’re here. And that’s just the way it should be. Germans should be buying a German car, I think. Americans should be buying American.”\n\nI hear this kind of thing repeatedly over several days: support for the president and indifference about both Harley’s response to the tariffs and the president’s attacks on Harley—the company whose bikes, of course, everyone is riding and celebrating. Some of the bikers I speak with are unaware of any discord at all.\n\nA man wearing a MAGA hat and a Harley shirt on the fairgrounds, who gives his name only as Marty, says of the president’s call for a boycott of Harley: “Oh, I didn’t get involved in that too much. I don’t know. I really can’t comment on it. I can comment on some other stuff if you want me to. Trump’s the man. He’s got my vote and I’m proud of it and he’s doing wonderful things for our economy and our country.”\n\nDean Gilbert, 62, who traveled with his wife and son from North Carolina, calls the tariff issues “news media hype.” “I don’t think it’s as bad as the news media says it is. And I may be wrong, but look,” he says, gesturing to his bike a few feet away, “how much steel is there in a Harley? The beef was that tariffs on the steel are gunna raise the price of the bikes. I don’t know if I believe that.” As to the president’s call for a boycott, Gilbert says, “you’ll have a few people that’ll say ‘I just won’t spend as much,’ but if you ride a Harley, you’ll ride a Harley. It wouldn’t stop me from buying one.”\n\nAfter Chuck Lennon, 67, has his picture taken in front of Harley headquarters on his yellow chrome bike, he tells me he “would rather Harley not build overseas, but I can see why they need to.” Lennon, a retired engineer from Las Vegas, generally supports the president, but he would not boycott Harley. “Trump says a lot of things,” he says. “It’s OK. We elected him.” Lennon is more concerned about “a small minority of groups that are trying to either rattle or destroy this country” than about Harley or tariffs. “The worst part about it,” he says, “is I think half of the protesters you see that are out there, they’re actually paid to be demonstrators. I honestly believe that.”\n\nIn the Harley-Davidson Museum, a famous speech from another 1960s biker film starring Peter Fonda, The Wild Angels—“We wanna be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man. And we wanna get loaded.”—is featured prominently in a montage of old movie clips. So are scenes of Fonda, Hopper and Nicholson out cruising in Easy Rider, Fonda seated on his “Captain America” chopper painted with stars and stripes. A replica of that bike sits opposite where the montage plays.\n\nA flag hangs from a pedestrian bridge at the Harley-Davidson headquarters. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nI notice a man watch the seven-minute montage and then return to the video screen a short time later to watch a second time. Afterwards, I ask what the clips mean to him, and the man, a retired soldier from Texas who gives his name only as Jon, talks about Easy Rider and feeling free on the road when he got his first Harley at 14, now 46 years ago. Then the conversation turns to Trump.\n\n“I’m not really familiar with what’s going on with Harley and all that,” he says. He would rather talk about immigration, telling me that “Germany was a good place” before “Merkel let all the Muslims in from Syria and it changed the culture over there.” Now “that place is going to shit.” “People coming into this country,” he says, need to “do it legally, and learn our traditions. I don’t want to know their damn shit. I really don’t.”\n\nThis, of course, reflects a particular—and narrow—view of freedom, rebellion and patriotism. Harley, too, offers a particular view, one rich in paradoxes. The company sells a pre-packaged rebellion, a starter kit that offers just enough customization for each rebel, on his or her own bike and in his or her own logoed paraphernalia, to feel unique. It sells freedom by way of conformity, sells consumers a rejection of consumerism.\n\nHarley does all this at rapt attention to flag and country, rendering the rebellion less against “the man” and more against the danger of an ill-defined decline. It unites a tribe around the shared memory of a mythic time when freedom, rebellion and country all were a harmonious whole, embodied within the swashbuckling cowboy, a man beholden to none, free to roam and take whatever he thought was his.\n\n“Who among us would not want to climb on a machine dripping in freedom and American style?” Bill Thomas, 64, says when I ask him why he rides a Harley. We are seated with his wife Linda, 65, at a makeshift bar on a beach along Lake Michigan. Earlier there were Harley races in the sand. “To breathe the very air that collides with the chrome steel you ride? ’Cause all we want to do is be free to ride our machines, get loaded when we want to, and not be hassled by the man.”\n\nBill laughs as he acknowledges that he is borrowing part of Fonda’s speech from The Wild Angels, the same one playing in the Harley museum. But what really got him on a bike, he says, was seeing Easy Rider at a drive-in theater when he was 15: “Ever since then, all I wanted was a motorcycle.” Now, Linda chimes in, he has three in the garage at their Pittsburgh home. “All Harleys,” Linda says. “Is there anything else?”\n\nIt is fitting—ironic, too—that Easy Rider has taken on such a central role in the mythology of Harley-Davison. Late in the film, Hopper and Fonda sit by another campfire, this time without Nicholson, whose character has died in a senseless act of violence. As Fonda broods, Hopper tries to cheer him up.\n\n“We did it!” he says. “We’re rich, man. We’re retirin’ in Florida now, mister.” Hopper is recalling the opening scenes of the film, where he and Fonda are middlemen in a drug deal, selling cocaine to a man in a Rolls Royce for a bundle of cash. The bills are still hidden in the fuel tank of Fonda’s bike. But the reminder does not cheer Fonda. “We blew it,” he says to Hopper, grimacing. “We blew it.”\n\nThe bikers thought they were buying their freedom, but really they were selling out, trading in their ideals for an easy payoff from the establishment. And retiring to Florida is not exactly the stuff of biker lore. Their vaunted freedom, it turns out, was just a mirage, a fantasy. When Fonda and Hopper’s lives are taken in the film’s iconic final scene, they are not merely victims of the killers, but of themselves.\n\nAnd yet, at least among the aging generation that still makes up Harley’s core constituency, the fantasy lives on. Fonda and Hopper’s biker characters are heroes and martyrs who stand for freedom, a totem powerful enough that in its service both Harley and the president can be right, or close enough to right that the disagreement doesn’t really matter. “’Course,” as Nicholson said, “don’t ever tell anybody they’re not free.”\n\nJohn F.

Its leaders have a habit of vaulting to the presidency. But though the state is home to what may be the country’s most liberal constituency, New York’s own government is a perpetual mockery of progressive values. Its elected Democrats have offered Democratic voters nothing but disappointment and outrage for decades.\n\nThe president of the United States himself is a product of New York’s rancid political waters, a real estate hustler who bragged in the 2016 election about buying off politicians before deciding to become one himself.\n\nBut incumbency is a difficult force to beat in New York (or anywhere else in America), and the litany of failures listed above would count as policy achievements in today’s Republican Party.

Andrew Cuomo (D) were convicted on corruption charges earlier this year, it remains very likely that he will be re-elected in November.\n\nThat leaves the New York attorney general as the best hope for cleaning up politics in New York and, perhaps, Washington.

James has cultivated a progressive record working within the New York political establishment, but her ties to toxic members of that establishment, including the governor, have hampered her throughout the campaign.\n\nThe national left has rallied behind Teachout, a staunch anti-corruption advocate whose academic book on the subject is a minor classic. Teachout has vowed to use the attorney general’s office to break the stranglehold that big finance and big real estate exercise over public spending priorities and has talked about functioning as a “regulator of last resort” for the country at large.\n\nSince so many major corporations are chartered in New York, Teachout has proposed opening investigations against them as a way to fight the Trump administration on everything from climate change to predatory lending. Like every other candidate in the race, she has vowed to relentlessly pursue any corrupt dealings within the Trump organization itself.\n\nBolstered by endorsements from The New York Times and the New York Daily News, Teachout has taken on the status of a front-runner. Several New York political figures, noting the way the wind is blowing, have defected to her camp. And in recent debates, James and other candidates have trained their fire on Teachout, all but ignoring one another.\n\nThe contest between Teachout and James is firmly within the established debate over how to go about reforming the Democratic Party ― not so much a question of values as one of tactics, a choice between a pragmatist who has notched small victories within a corrupt system and an idealistic outsider who promises to overhaul that very system.\n\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who entered the race on June 6, does not fit within this paradigm. In 2013, he was one of just nine Democrats in the House who voted with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in his gambit to suspend implementation of Obamacare ― a clash that resulted in a government shutdown. Two years later, he was one of only four House Democrats who voted with Republicans to bar undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing aid. He voted with Republicans on two major laws unwinding key parts of the post-financial crisis Wall Street reforms. One Maloney-backed repeal will enable banks to hide racial discrimination in mortgage lending, while another, authored by Citigroup lobbyists, provided federal subsidies to big banks trading in the risky derivatives at the heart of the 2008 crash. He has voted to increase Donald Trump’s military budget and expand his warrantless surveillance powers.\n\nA Maloney campaign spokesperson declined to address the lawmaker’s voting record with HuffPost.\n\nMaloney is even operating his campaign for attorney general as a test case on state campaign finance regulation. Teachout, a campaign finance expert, recently filed suit against him for moving $1.4 million raised for his congressional race into his state contest ― a move that, if upheld in court, would create a loophole to help politicians avoid state disclosure requirements and contribution limits.\n\nFront-runners with comfortable leads do not file lawsuits against their political opponents in the closing days of a campaign. The case is a risky strategic move indicating that Teachout views Maloney as a serious threat to the nomination. What little polling exists for the race suggests her fears are justified. Two polls released over the summer ― before Teachout began receiving high-profile endorsements ― gave James the lead, followed by Maloney in second and Teachout a close third. More than 40 percent of the electorate were still undecided, and majorities indicated they had either never heard of or had no opinion about James or Teachout.\n\nIn a contest like that, name recognition matters more than any policy position. The congressman, who has represented a swing district in the Hudson Valley since 2013, benefits most in that regard. The two ways to boost name recognition are through good press ― of which Teachout has secured plenty ― and ample television advertising. Maloney’s $3 million war chest ― more than five times what Teachout had raised as of Aug. 6 ― has helped put his smiling face on TV screens across New York state, which may be enough to put him over the top. His biggest funders include Wall Street banks, real estate developers and corporate law firms, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "clickbait": null}

Tim Ryan wants you to know: Just because he meditates doesn’t mean he’s soft. He’s from Ohio’s blue-collar Mahoning Valley, the steel valley, home of Youngstown, a district where 45,000 people voted for both him and Donald Trump.\n\nSo if you’ve read that Congress’ foremost advocate of mindfulness wants to run for president in 2020 by winning the “yoga vote”—and if that seems risky against an incumbent with a Triumph-the-Insult-Comic-Dog attack style—well, that’s only part of Ryan’s story.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“I think once you meet me, you realize I’m not necessarily some soft yoga guy,” says Ryan, a tall, well-built former high-school quarterback. “I’ve been on the picket line. I’ve been in the union halls. I’ll drink a Miller Lite with you.”\n\nFighter is a political compliment. Inner-peace seeker is not. But Ryan will tell you a candidate can be both. Ryan speaks in sports lingo even more than the average male pol. That’s how he pitches mindfulness to skeptics: It’s something he learned about from legendary former NBA coach Phil Jackson’s book, Sacred Hoops. “I always saw it as a performance enhancer,” Ryan says.\n\nSports talk is also how the eight-term congressman expresses the reasons he might, just might, run for president in 2020. “The only reason I entertain the conversations is that I’m tired of losing,” Ryan says. “I’m tired of playing defense.”\n\nAs Democrats try to reverse their 2016 losses in the Rust Belt, Ryan’s popularity in Ohio’s working class 13th Congressional District stands out. He far outran Hillary Clinton’s performance there, immune to her Midwestern collapse. When Ryan led a revolt against House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in late 2016, he pitched a leadership shift away from the coasts and toward a pro-worker economic agenda. Pelosi doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, and Ryan lost that vote by a 2-1 margin—but his challenge seems prescient two years later, as roughly 60 Democratic House candidates have declared they will not support the much-demonized Pelosi for speaker.\n\nThis summer came reports that Ryan is open to taking on Pelosi again, or even running for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president. A dozen bigger names might outrank Ryan on the presidential racing forms, he might be unknown outside Ohio and Capitol Hill, and he’s only 45. But Ryan believes he could help shape a Democratic answer to Trumpism that transcends geographic and economic boundaries—a coalition of yoga mats and hard hats.\n\nRyan’s traveling like a presidential candidate, hitting the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding dinner, going to California to fund-raise, barnstorming for Democrats in swing House districts, speaking at both the centrist Third Way think tank’s conference and the progressive Netroots Nation convention. He’s talking like a candidate, too.\n\n“Maybe the country needs a scrapper, a guy who’s not going to take any prisoners—sportsmanlike, but play to win,” Ryan says. “We collectively should be helping the people who have gotten screwed for the last 30 years, and not apologize for it,” Ryan says. “So that’s why, at the very least, I’m going to be part of shaping the national discussion. The very least.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nA political prodigy, Ryan was elected to the Ohio state Senate at age 27 and the U.S. House at 29. He succeeded his former boss, Jim Traficant, Youngstown’s bombastic, profane proto-Trump congressman. Ryan ran for the House in 2002, the year Traficant was convicted of bribery and racketeering and expelled from the chamber. In the Democratic primary, Ryan took on incumbent Rep. Tom Sawyer of Akron, who was competing on new turf due to redistricting. Ryan beat Sawyer by pulling a Trump: bashing his votes for NAFTA and trade with China—a winning play in the anti-free trade Mahoning Valley. In the general election, Ryan won 51 percent in a three-way race against Traficant (who got 15 percent from jail) and a Republican.\n\nThough a strong union supporter, Ryan developed a centrist reputation in Congress. He had an A rating from the NRA in his 2002 race. A practicing Roman Catholic, he opposed abortion rights. Then came his turning point.\n\nTim Ryan is reflected in the lens of a TV camera while speaking to reporters in November 2016, following a House Democratic Caucus election in which his effort to oust Nancy Pelosi as leader failed, 134-63. | AP\n\nOn a days-long retreat after the 2008 election, Ryan found that meditation helped him cope with the congressional grind of traveling and fundraising. He quickly integrated mindfulness into his policy program. “I recognized its potential to help transform core institutions in America—school, hospitals, the military, and social services,” Ryan wrote in his 2012 book, A Mindful Nation. “I felt that this simple practice could help my constituents face the many stressful challenges of daily life.”\n\nRyan advocates teaching mindfulness in schools and has sponsored deep-breathing and meditation programs in his district for veterans suffering from PTSD. “People will tease me a little bit about it,” Ryan says, “but you would be surprised at the amount of people who come up to me and say they’ve tried it, or they read my book and how much it’s helped them.”\n\nAs Ryan has embraced mindfulness, he’s also moved to the left politically, including on issues that fall along cultural fault lines.\n\nAfter the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, he distanced himself from the NRA, and after the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, he gave $20,000—the amount the NRA had contributed to his campaigns over the years—to gun-safety groups.\n\nIn 2015, Ryan announced that he now supported abortion rights, influenced by constituents who’d chosen abortion because of abuse and personal hardships. “Today, I am a 41-year-old father and husband,” he wrote in an Akron Beacon Journal op-ed. “I have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator.” Marriage and fatherhood influenced him. The final step in his rethinking, he says, came before the 2014 birth of their son, Brady, as Ryan and his wife, Andrea, nervously awaited the results of prenatal testing. “As we were sitting there, I thought to myself, ‘Man, if something’s really, really wrong here, should the government be in this room, telling us what we should or should not do?’ I’ve got a little bit of that libertarian streak in me on certain issues, and I was like, ‘You can’t do this anymore.’”\n\nRyan joined the healthy-food movement with his second book, 2014’s The Real Food Revolution, itself a mix of feel-good self-help and crunchy policy proposals (decentralization of seed production, labeling of GMOs). He voted against this year’s farm bill after writing op-eds about the need to help family farmers more and reduce subsidies for big agriculture.\n\nThis year, he endorsed marijuana legalization, citing the potential for new tax revenue and the “unjust” fact that “the burden of these low-level drug charges fall on minority communities.”\n\nRepublicans portray Ryan’s changed positions as a sign that he lacks core values. “Obviously, his ambitions are higher than his current status,” says Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken. “He seemed to be a Blue Dog moderate Democrat when he first ran. Now he’s espousing very liberal positions. I see him as more of an opportunist than a principled Democrat.”\n\nEven so, you’ll still see Ryan described as centrist sometimes. Last year, he broke with his party to support a corporate tax cut, though he ended up voting against the tax-reform law. He’s not that far left. He says he opposes a federal jobs-guarantee program: “I think the path forward is to get private capital into communities and create a new and better free enterprise system,” he says.\n\nBut he’s not that centrist, either. He has supported single-payer health care since at least 2007, and he’s a reliable vote for labor and against free trade, earning a 98 percent lifetime rating from the AFL-CIO.\n\n“I think he’s gotten much better over the years, and really matured as an officeholder,” says Harriet Applegate, executive secretary of the North Shore AFL-CIO in Cleveland. Applegate, who has worked with Ryan on statewide labor issues, recalls the young Ryan as a “swashbuckling maverick.” She thinks his mindfulness training has mellowed the swagger. “He’s made himself a more complete person and shed some of that uber-masculinity.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC News’ Dan Harris just after Trump’s inauguration, Ryan said he hoped meditation could help him see through Trump’s bombast to find an issue they could work on together. Did it work? Ryan laughs. “It helped me not get frustrated when he has not worked with us,” he says. Like some other Democrats, he’d hoped to work with Trump on infrastructure and maybe health care. “I thought there were going to be a few issues that we would maybe find some common ground on. And then he came right in and torched the joint.”\n\nTrump’s belligerence seems to threaten a lot of Americans’ inner peace — causing them extreme stress, even trauma. Can mindfulness help? Ryan, who meditates for about 25 minutes each morning, suggests politically minded people should claim some quiet, silent time every day. “Do it for a week or two, and you will notice that there’s a little bit of space between stimulus and response,” Ryan says. “We can get so overstimulated that we get hyper-reactive and we develop habitual reactions, to Trump, or politics, or our own personal relationships. It helps you create a little bit of space that will get your blood pressure down.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nOhio’s Mahoning Valley used to vote deep-blue in presidential elections, but no longer. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Ryan’s 13th Congressional District, but only 51 percent to 44 percent, a plummet from Barack Obama’s 63-36 win over Mitt Romney there four years earlier. Trump’s opposition to free trade helped him in Ohio, Ryan thinks, as did the fact that many voters there were still struggling after eight years of Obama. “Because he was a Republican breaking orthodoxy, I think people gave him a chance,” Ryan says.\n\nRyan, though, won with 68 percent of the vote, beating his Republican opponent by 36 percentage points and outrunning Clinton in his district by 45,000 votes. That means roughly 45,000 of Ryan’s supporters in 2016 were Ryan-Trump voters.\n\nRyan says he’ll often chat with people who tell him they voted for him and for Trump, to understand their thinking. “Most of the time, it’s not an issue,” Ryan says—it’s about attitude. “Maybe it’s China. Maybe it’s taking on the system.” He thinks his constituents respect his early runs against fellow Democrats and his challenge of Pelosi. “People around here see me as the guy who was always taking on the establishment,” he says. “I’ve been on picket lines with them, and just lived with them for 16 years, so they know I’m with them.”\n\nWashington, UNITED STATES: Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (R) addresses the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee election night party in Washington, DC, 07 November 2006 as (L to R, background) Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Tim Ryan (D-OH), and Kendrick Meek (D-FL), .

Connelly led the Pledge of Allegiance at a 2016 Trump rally and organized the president’s 2017 visit to a Mahoning Valley AMVETS chapter. Connelly’s Facebook feed includes messages of support for Trump — and pictures of Connelly posing with Ryan at the dedication of a local veteran’s painting of George Washington.\n\n“This guy goes to bat and fights for us,” Connelly says of Ryan. “He fights for us veterans and a better country.” Connelly says he’s all for Ryan’s interest in meditation, because it’s a way to help vets with PTSD. “Do we always agree? No. But we do agree on China, the military and veterans’ issues. He never stops fighting.”\n\nConnelly says Ryan “comes from a blue-collar working family.” Ryan was raised in Niles, a one-time ironmaking town, by his single mother, Rochelle, a courthouse worker.\n\n“I think Tim Ryan gets where the working class is coming from in a way that a lot of Democrats don’t, and in a way the coastal Democrats seem not to,” says the AFL-CIO’s Applegate.\n\nRyan says the Democrats need a sharper economic message to win. He’s for a $15 minimum wage, but says that’s not enough. Many of his constituents, he says, lost $30 to $40 per hour jobs in the 2000s when the automotive supplier Delphi moved work from Warren to Mexico.\n\n“We are all for the ‘fight for 15,’ but my people were making $40 an hour, and now they’re making $15,” Ryan says. “We need to be a party saying, ‘We are not going to be happy until we get those $30, $40, $50 an hour jobs back for working-class people.”\n\nRyan says the “A Better Deal” agenda proposed by congressional Democratic leaders, including Pelosi, isn’t bold enough. He wants to rebuild communities “bypassed by globalization” by eliminating all blighted buildings within three to four years, wiring the communities with broadband, and funding education and early-stage startups.\n\nDoes Ryan want a rematch with Pelosi for the job of minority leader, or even speaker? “The door is open,” he says. “Clearly, she does not play well in a lot of the districts that we need to win.”\n\nPelosi has been dismissive of her once-and-maybe-future challenger. She called Ryan and fellow Pelosi critic Seth Moulton “inconsequential” in a July Rolling Stone interview. “They don’t have a following in our caucus. None,” she said. “I can’t even think that they think it’s a good idea to say, ‘We have the first woman speaker, and now we’re going to say we’re not going to do that.’”\n\nThose are fighting words in a Democratic Party that seems increasingly torn between a political approach dominated by identity versus one defined by economics. Could taking on Pelosi hurt Ryan with Democratic women if he runs for president in 2020?\n\nRyan waves off the question. “My opposition to Nancy Pelosi has nothing to do with her. We’re down 1,000 state legislative seats [since 2009]. We lost 68 seats in Congress [between 2009 and 2015]. We keep losing. And, on behalf of women, on behalf of people of color, on behalf of working-class whites and immigrants — we need to win. We have a moral obligation to win, and we’re not.”\n\nAs identity’s importance grows in politics, Ryan’s trying to straddle at least two worlds in the Democrats’ fraying coalition. He sells meditation to the working class with appeals to star-athlete yogis, mentally disciplined Navy SEALs and veterans soothing their PTSD.\n\nBut what about the other way around?\n\nIn the Trump era, Democratic primary voters may not be interested in a Rust Belt-based white guy who hasn’t given up on winning over Trump voters. If the wellness vote or yoga vote is more deep-blue, professional and feminine than the hard-hat vote, can Ryan get the mindful to keep an open mind?\n\n“I would hope that people who are spending time calming themselves down, taking care of themselves, would be slightly less judgmental,” Ryan says, and “at least open their hearts up to understanding why some of these folks voted for Trump. Obviously, something was going wrong. Obviously, they wanted something different.”\n\nErick Trickey is a writer in Boston.", "clickbait": null}

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) literally shoots a document representing the Republican-led lawsuit that could end a key and very popular Affordable Care Act provision.\n\nThe 30-second spot starts with Manchin mentioning an ad that helped catapult him to the Senate in 2010, in which he took “dead aim” at a complicated cap-and-trade environmental bill that had passed in the House. Manchin, rated by analysts as among the most vulnerable senators on the ballot this year, in the new ad takes aim against the effort to invalidate Obamacare’s insurance protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey, Manchin’s GOP challenger in November’s election, is among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that would allow insurance companies to deny coverage to people with various pre-existing conditions.\n\n“He is just dead wrong and that ain’t going to happen,” Manchin says in his ad.\n\nPatrick Morrisey's lawsuit would take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions. That's just dead wrong, and that ain't gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/QFTSZGnmdK — Joe Manchin (@JoeManchinWV) September 10, 2018\n\nIn a state where polls show approval of President Donald Trump is among the highest in the country, Manchin is making health care the central focus of his re-election bid. And it’s not hard to see why: West Virginia has the highest share of adults with pre-existing conditions of any state.\n\nThe Obamacare protections are “the difference between life and death for the 800,000 West Virginians with a pre-existing condition. I will continue doing everything in my power to protect their access to affordable health care,” Manchin said at a health care forum in Huntington, West Virginia,\n\nLast week, attorneys representing 20 Republican state officials walked into a Texas courtroom and ask a federal judge to invalidate all or parts of Obamacare. District Judge Reed O’Connor appeared sympathetic to their case in oral arguments, but he did not immediately rule on the lawsuit’s motion for an injunction against the law. If it succeeds, experts say it will unleash chaos on the health insurance markets and, eventually, leave an estimated 17 million Americans without coverage.\n\nManchin is a former West Virginia governor whose folksy style and centrist voting record has sustained his career in his state. Indeed, his campaign’s focus on the pre-existing conditions issue stands in sharp contrast to the careful way he has approached Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring last week’s confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, several of Manchin’s fellow Senate Democrats argued that Kavanaugh’s past writings as an appellate court judge indicate he would take an ax to Obamacare if given the chance as a Supreme Court justice. But Kavanaugh has also faced criticism from some conservatives who say he is insufficiently opposed to the law.\n\nManchin has not yet said how he will vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination.

It’s going to be 90 degrees outside.’ Of course, I insisted and wore it. I can still remember how miserable I was sweating through that first day. The backs of my legs were stuck on that itchy wool skirt. Sweat dripped down my legs. When I got home, my mother said, ‘How was it wearing your outfit on the first day?’ I said, ‘It was just great.’ When you determine something’s going to be great, it will be great.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida offered up this:\n\nMy first day on the job after my freshman year in high school was a disaster. I was working as a messenger and courier.

But when I went through the door, I realized it was unlike any other meeting I had ever been to, or any woman had ever been to, because there it was, the leadership of our country, all men, and I, as a woman, having a seat at the table. As President Bush welcomed me there, I felt very closed in to my seat. I couldn’t figure out what it was, and then I realized — there I was with Sojourner Truth, Susan B.

Han, 25, grew up in Las Vegas, but went to college in the Bay Area and spent a year there working as a biochemist.\n\nYet she returned to enroll as a member of the first class at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Medicine. The school opened last year to address a chronic shortage of doctors in Southern Nevada and broaden the city’s economic base.\n\nFew cities were hit as hard as Las Vegas by the 2008 financial crisis and recession, which eroded consumer spending on the sort of fast thrills the city had to offer and left it with the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. Home prices plummeted 62 percent from their peak in 2006 to their bottom in 2012, according to data from ATTOM Data Solutions, a real estate tracking firm.\n\nNow Han is part of a group of medical students whose decision to stay and practice in Las Vegas after graduation may give the city hope that it can reduce its reliance on casinos.\n\n“We are in an early stage of building what could be a start-up culture here,” Han said. “We’re trying to make it a real city, not just a transient one.”\n\nNevada as a whole lost more jobs in relation to its workforce than any other state, with more than 70 percent of those losses in the Las Vegas region. There, unemployment rate hit 14.2 percent at the depth of the recession, well above the national peak of 10 percent and nearly triple where it was before the downturn began in 2007.\n\nThough construction cranes once again rise above casinos along the Strip, Las Vegas is trying to prepare for the next downturn – whenever that may be - by trying to wean itself off the reliance on housing and hospitality and turning to industries ranging from professional sports to medical care.\n\n“We are trying to build a world class city,” says Mayor Carolyn Goodman, citing investments in infrastructure and efforts to woo new businesses.\n\nYet the question remains whether it will be enough.\n\nOther hard-hit Sun Belt cities, such as Orlando and Phoenix have outpaced Las Vegas in job growth since the crisis and have more diversified economies, said Steven Pedigo, a professor of economic development at New York University. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2CIaReC)\n\n“They were absolutely killed and I think it’s fair to say that they are only starting to rebound now,” Pedigo said about Las Vegas. “If Las Vegas doesn’t build some buffer around its economy it will always be a boom and bust town.”\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nBET ON HEALTHCARE\n\nOver the last five years, businesses including Amazon-owned Zappos, data company Switch Inc (SWCH.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) itself have opened new headquarters or regional hubs in the Las Vegas metro area, bringing approximately 3,000 new jobs thanks in part to more than $15 million in tax incentives. But the University of Nevada’s medical school is at the core of the city’s vision of its future.\n\nBy 2030, it is expected to add 8,000 jobs and contribute $1.2 billion annually to the metro area’s $111 billion economy. Established with $27 million in state funding, the school now has 143 full-time faculty and employs over 1,000, said Dr. Barbara Atkinson, the school’s founding dean.\n\n“The major impetus to start the medical school was the economic impact,” she said. “Each new physician that comes here usually hires between two and five other staff people, and they have more than enough patients.”\n\nThe city and state have also invested more than $36 million in infrastructure, such as street improvements, and marketing and has another $97 million planned to build out the Las Vegas Medical District. The city expects the cluster of medical office buildings and hospitals four miles (6.44 km) north of the Strip will add 16,000 jobs and contribute $2.4 billion to the local economy annually by 2030.\n\nThe improvements are paid in part by bonds issued by a regional transportation agency that administers the Las Vegas region’s first planning blueprint to handle what it expects to be a nearly 45 percent population growth by 2045.\n\nAlready, there are signs that the economy is shifting. Around 100,000 jobs are in health and education-related fields, an increase of more than 50 percent from 10 years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the same time, construction employment is down 38 percent at about 65,000.\n\nYet tourism and hospitality, with its thousands of low-paying, entry-level jobs, still accounts for nearly a third of the region’s workforce, three times the national average. Casinos MGM Resorts International (MGM.N), Caesars Entertainment (CZR.O), Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O), and Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N) together employ over 102,400 in the area, according to data from the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, a local development group.\n\nHOUSING HANGOVER EASING\n\nProfessional sports and legal marijuana may also help broaden the city’s economy.\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights hockey team reached the Stanley Cup Finals this year, giving the city its first major professional sports experience. At the south end of the Strip, a $1.8 billion domed stadium for the National Football League’s Raiders is under construction and could host the Super Bowl as early as 2023. Tax revenues from marijuana sales, which Nevada legalized in July 2017, surpassed the state’s 12-month estimate of $50 million within 10 months.\n\n“We anticipate that recent, modest diversification in employment will provide some marginal resilience in a future recession,” Moody’s analyst Patrick Liberatore, wrote in a May report upgrading the city’s credit rating to Aa2, the third highest investment grade. Still, the area’s reliance on tourism “will always leave it exposed to economic downturns,” he wrote.\n\nThe influx of newcomers into Clark County, Nevada’s most populous county with 2.25 million residents, has helped push housing prices up more than 15 percent this year so far, though average prices are still below pre-crisis peaks. Real-estate listing firm Zillow estimates prices will rise another 8 percent over the next 12 months, driven in part by continued arrivals of Californians priced out of their markets.\n\nWhether those gains will last, however, is a matter of debate, with Fitch Ratings recently describing the metro area as the most overpriced market in the country.\n\n“Las Vegans once thought we were recession-proof,” said Stephen Miller, a business professor at UNLV. “We learned our lesson and made some progress, but we need to make a lot more.”\n\n(This version of the story has been refiled to remove extraneous word in paragraph 1)", "name": "Las Vegas is booming again, and bracing itself for next slump", "description": "Diane Han is trying to leave the Las Vegas of her childhood behind.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-crisis2008-lasvegas/las-vegas-is-booming-again-and-bracing-itself-for-next-slump-idUSKCN1LR0YX?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "id": "ceb1e8d0198742e02c777c0ca74161d3b6968d4d", "keywords": ["strip", "trying", "school", "slump", "city", "bracing", "las", "medical", "booming", "vegas", "economic", "jobs", "million"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T14:58:39+00:00"}

Tim Ryan wants you to know: Just because he meditates doesn’t mean he’s soft. He’s from Ohio’s blue-collar Mahoning Valley, the steel valley, home of Youngstown, a district where 45,000 people voted for both him and Donald Trump.\n\nSo if you’ve read that Congress’ foremost advocate of mindfulness wants to run for president in 2020 by winning the “yoga vote”—and if that seems risky against an incumbent with a Triumph-the-Insult-Comic-Dog attack style—well, that’s only part of Ryan’s story.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“I think once you meet me, you realize I’m not necessarily some soft yoga guy,” says Ryan, a tall, well-built former high-school quarterback. “I’ve been on the picket line. I’ve been in the union halls. I’ll drink a Miller Lite with you.”\n\nFighter is a political compliment. Inner-peace seeker is not. But Ryan will tell you a candidate can be both. Ryan speaks in sports lingo even more than the average male pol. That’s how he pitches mindfulness to skeptics: It’s something he learned about from legendary former NBA coach Phil Jackson’s book, Sacred Hoops. “I always saw it as a performance enhancer,” Ryan says.\n\nSports talk is also how the eight-term congressman expresses the reasons he might, just might, run for president in 2020. “The only reason I entertain the conversations is that I’m tired of losing,” Ryan says. “I’m tired of playing defense.”\n\nAs Democrats try to reverse their 2016 losses in the Rust Belt, Ryan’s popularity in Ohio’s working class 13th Congressional District stands out. He far outran Hillary Clinton’s performance there, immune to her Midwestern collapse. When Ryan led a revolt against House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in late 2016, he pitched a leadership shift away from the coasts and toward a pro-worker economic agenda. Pelosi doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, and Ryan lost that vote by a 2-1 margin—but his challenge seems prescient two years later, as roughly 60 Democratic House candidates have declared they will not support the much-demonized Pelosi for speaker.\n\nThis summer came reports that Ryan is open to taking on Pelosi again, or even running for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president. A dozen bigger names might outrank Ryan on the presidential racing forms, he might be unknown outside Ohio and Capitol Hill, and he’s only 45. But Ryan believes he could help shape a Democratic answer to Trumpism that transcends geographic and economic boundaries—a coalition of yoga mats and hard hats.\n\nRyan’s traveling like a presidential candidate, hitting the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding dinner, going to California to fund-raise, barnstorming for Democrats in swing House districts, speaking at both the centrist Third Way think tank’s conference and the progressive Netroots Nation convention. He’s talking like a candidate, too.\n\n“Maybe the country needs a scrapper, a guy who’s not going to take any prisoners—sportsmanlike, but play to win,” Ryan says. “We collectively should be helping the people who have gotten screwed for the last 30 years, and not apologize for it,” Ryan says. “So that’s why, at the very least, I’m going to be part of shaping the national discussion. The very least.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nA political prodigy, Ryan was elected to the Ohio state Senate at age 27 and the U.S. House at 29. He succeeded his former boss, Jim Traficant, Youngstown’s bombastic, profane proto-Trump congressman. Ryan ran for the House in 2002, the year Traficant was convicted of bribery and racketeering and expelled from the chamber. In the Democratic primary, Ryan took on incumbent Rep. Tom Sawyer of Akron, who was competing on new turf due to redistricting. Ryan beat Sawyer by pulling a Trump: bashing his votes for NAFTA and trade with China—a winning play in the anti-free trade Mahoning Valley. In the general election, Ryan won 51 percent in a three-way race against Traficant (who got 15 percent from jail) and a Republican.\n\nThough a strong union supporter, Ryan developed a centrist reputation in Congress. He had an A rating from the NRA in his 2002 race. A practicing Roman Catholic, he opposed abortion rights. Then came his turning point.\n\nTim Ryan is reflected in the lens of a TV camera while speaking to reporters in November 2016, following a House Democratic Caucus election in which his effort to oust Nancy Pelosi as leader failed, 134-63. | AP\n\nOn a days-long retreat after the 2008 election, Ryan found that meditation helped him cope with the congressional grind of traveling and fundraising. He quickly integrated mindfulness into his policy program. “I recognized its potential to help transform core institutions in America—school, hospitals, the military, and social services,” Ryan wrote in his 2012 book, A Mindful Nation. “I felt that this simple practice could help my constituents face the many stressful challenges of daily life.”\n\nRyan advocates teaching mindfulness in schools and has sponsored deep-breathing and meditation programs in his district for veterans suffering from PTSD. “People will tease me a little bit about it,” Ryan says, “but you would be surprised at the amount of people who come up to me and say they’ve tried it, or they read my book and how much it’s helped them.”\n\nAs Ryan has embraced mindfulness, he’s also moved to the left politically, including on issues that fall along cultural fault lines.\n\nAfter the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, he distanced himself from the NRA, and after the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, he gave $20,000—the amount the NRA had contributed to his campaigns over the years—to gun-safety groups.\n\nIn 2015, Ryan announced that he now supported abortion rights, influenced by constituents who’d chosen abortion because of abuse and personal hardships. “Today, I am a 41-year-old father and husband,” he wrote in an Akron Beacon Journal op-ed. “I have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator.” Marriage and fatherhood influenced him. The final step in his rethinking, he says, came before the 2014 birth of their son, Brady, as Ryan and his wife, Andrea, nervously awaited the results of prenatal testing. “As we were sitting there, I thought to myself, ‘Man, if something’s really, really wrong here, should the government be in this room, telling us what we should or should not do?’ I’ve got a little bit of that libertarian streak in me on certain issues, and I was like, ‘You can’t do this anymore.’”\n\nRyan joined the healthy-food movement with his second book, 2014’s The Real Food Revolution, itself a mix of feel-good self-help and crunchy policy proposals (decentralization of seed production, labeling of GMOs). He voted against this year’s farm bill after writing op-eds about the need to help family farmers more and reduce subsidies for big agriculture.\n\nThis year, he endorsed marijuana legalization, citing the potential for new tax revenue and the “unjust” fact that “the burden of these low-level drug charges fall on minority communities.”\n\nRepublicans portray Ryan’s changed positions as a sign that he lacks core values. “Obviously, his ambitions are higher than his current status,” says Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken. “He seemed to be a Blue Dog moderate Democrat when he first ran. Now he’s espousing very liberal positions. I see him as more of an opportunist than a principled Democrat.”\n\nEven so, you’ll still see Ryan described as centrist sometimes. Last year, he broke with his party to support a corporate tax cut, though he ended up voting against the tax-reform law. He’s not that far left. He says he opposes a federal jobs-guarantee program: “I think the path forward is to get private capital into communities and create a new and better free enterprise system,” he says.\n\nBut he’s not that centrist, either. He has supported single-payer health care since at least 2007, and he’s a reliable vote for labor and against free trade, earning a 98 percent lifetime rating from the AFL-CIO.\n\n“I think he’s gotten much better over the years, and really matured as an officeholder,” says Harriet Applegate, executive secretary of the North Shore AFL-CIO in Cleveland. Applegate, who has worked with Ryan on statewide labor issues, recalls the young Ryan as a “swashbuckling maverick.” She thinks his mindfulness training has mellowed the swagger. “He’s made himself a more complete person and shed some of that uber-masculinity.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC News’ Dan Harris just after Trump’s inauguration, Ryan said he hoped meditation could help him see through Trump’s bombast to find an issue they could work on together. Did it work? Ryan laughs. “It helped me not get frustrated when he has not worked with us,” he says. Like some other Democrats, he’d hoped to work with Trump on infrastructure and maybe health care. “I thought there were going to be a few issues that we would maybe find some common ground on. And then he came right in and torched the joint.”\n\nTrump’s belligerence seems to threaten a lot of Americans’ inner peace — causing them extreme stress, even trauma. Can mindfulness help? Ryan, who meditates for about 25 minutes each morning, suggests politically minded people should claim some quiet, silent time every day. “Do it for a week or two, and you will notice that there’s a little bit of space between stimulus and response,” Ryan says. “We can get so overstimulated that we get hyper-reactive and we develop habitual reactions, to Trump, or politics, or our own personal relationships. It helps you create a little bit of space that will get your blood pressure down.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nOhio’s Mahoning Valley used to vote deep-blue in presidential elections, but no longer. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Ryan’s 13th Congressional District, but only 51 percent to 44 percent, a plummet from Barack Obama’s 63-36 win over Mitt Romney there four years earlier. Trump’s opposition to free trade helped him in Ohio, Ryan thinks, as did the fact that many voters there were still struggling after eight years of Obama. “Because he was a Republican breaking orthodoxy, I think people gave him a chance,” Ryan says.\n\nRyan, though, won with 68 percent of the vote, beating his Republican opponent by 36 percentage points and outrunning Clinton in his district by 45,000 votes. That means roughly 45,000 of Ryan’s supporters in 2016 were Ryan-Trump voters.\n\nRyan says he’ll often chat with people who tell him they voted for him and for Trump, to understand their thinking. “Most of the time, it’s not an issue,” Ryan says—it’s about attitude. “Maybe it’s China. Maybe it’s taking on the system.” He thinks his constituents respect his early runs against fellow Democrats and his challenge of Pelosi. “People around here see me as the guy who was always taking on the establishment,” he says. “I’ve been on picket lines with them, and just lived with them for 16 years, so they know I’m with them.”\n\nWashington, UNITED STATES: Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (R) addresses the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee election night party in Washington, DC, 07 November 2006 as (L to R, background) Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Tim Ryan (D-OH), and Kendrick Meek (D-FL), .

Connelly led the Pledge of Allegiance at a 2016 Trump rally and organized the president’s 2017 visit to a Mahoning Valley AMVETS chapter. Connelly’s Facebook feed includes messages of support for Trump — and pictures of Connelly posing with Ryan at the dedication of a local veteran’s painting of George Washington.\n\n“This guy goes to bat and fights for us,” Connelly says of Ryan. “He fights for us veterans and a better country.” Connelly says he’s all for Ryan’s interest in meditation, because it’s a way to help vets with PTSD. “Do we always agree? No. But we do agree on China, the military and veterans’ issues. He never stops fighting.”\n\nConnelly says Ryan “comes from a blue-collar working family.” Ryan was raised in Niles, a one-time ironmaking town, by his single mother, Rochelle, a courthouse worker.\n\n“I think Tim Ryan gets where the working class is coming from in a way that a lot of Democrats don’t, and in a way the coastal Democrats seem not to,” says the AFL-CIO’s Applegate.\n\nRyan says the Democrats need a sharper economic message to win. He’s for a $15 minimum wage, but says that’s not enough. Many of his constituents, he says, lost $30 to $40 per hour jobs in the 2000s when the automotive supplier Delphi moved work from Warren to Mexico.\n\n“We are all for the ‘fight for 15,’ but my people were making $40 an hour, and now they’re making $15,” Ryan says. “We need to be a party saying, ‘We are not going to be happy until we get those $30, $40, $50 an hour jobs back for working-class people.”\n\nRyan says the “A Better Deal” agenda proposed by congressional Democratic leaders, including Pelosi, isn’t bold enough. He wants to rebuild communities “bypassed by globalization” by eliminating all blighted buildings within three to four years, wiring the communities with broadband, and funding education and early-stage startups.\n\nDoes Ryan want a rematch with Pelosi for the job of minority leader, or even speaker? “The door is open,” he says. “Clearly, she does not play well in a lot of the districts that we need to win.”\n\nPelosi has been dismissive of her once-and-maybe-future challenger. She called Ryan and fellow Pelosi critic Seth Moulton “inconsequential” in a July Rolling Stone interview. “They don’t have a following in our caucus. None,” she said. “I can’t even think that they think it’s a good idea to say, ‘We have the first woman speaker, and now we’re going to say we’re not going to do that.’”\n\nThose are fighting words in a Democratic Party that seems increasingly torn between a political approach dominated by identity versus one defined by economics. Could taking on Pelosi hurt Ryan with Democratic women if he runs for president in 2020?\n\nRyan waves off the question. “My opposition to Nancy Pelosi has nothing to do with her. We’re down 1,000 state legislative seats [since 2009]. We lost 68 seats in Congress [between 2009 and 2015]. We keep losing. And, on behalf of women, on behalf of people of color, on behalf of working-class whites and immigrants — we need to win. We have a moral obligation to win, and we’re not.”\n\nAs identity’s importance grows in politics, Ryan’s trying to straddle at least two worlds in the Democrats’ fraying coalition. He sells meditation to the working class with appeals to star-athlete yogis, mentally disciplined Navy SEALs and veterans soothing their PTSD.\n\nBut what about the other way around?\n\nIn the Trump era, Democratic primary voters may not be interested in a Rust Belt-based white guy who hasn’t given up on winning over Trump voters. If the wellness vote or yoga vote is more deep-blue, professional and feminine than the hard-hat vote, can Ryan get the mindful to keep an open mind?\n\n“I would hope that people who are spending time calming themselves down, taking care of themselves, would be slightly less judgmental,” Ryan says, and “at least open their hearts up to understanding why some of these folks voted for Trump. Obviously, something was going wrong. Obviously, they wanted something different.”\n\nErick Trickey is a writer in Boston.", "name": "Nancy Pelosi’s Chief Antagonist Wants To Do Yoga and Have a Beer With You", "description": "Can Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan be both the blue-collar “guy you want to have a beer with” and the winner of the “yoga vote”?", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/09/tim-ryan-2020-presidential-candidate-yoga-beer-mindfulness-interview-profile-219738", "id": "ef16a17b007dc505980b8134fe7a678bf06d0067", "keywords": ["beer", "pelosis", "yoga", "democratic", "ryan", "vote", "wants", "trump", "think", "democrats", "ryans", "hes", "going", "nancy", "antagonist", "chief", "pelosi"], "timestamp": "2018-09-09T00:00:00"}

We know we can’t play around with this,” said Jennifer Oosterwyk, who owns the Sugar Britches boutique on Holden Beach and lives in nearby Wilmington.\n\nA BP service station and mini-mart in Wilmington ran out of gasoline for about two hours on Monday as motorists rushed to fill up their tanks. “People are getting frantic,” assistant manager Nadine Schrock said, adding her shop also sold out of cases of bottled water.\n\nHurricane Florence is seen from the International Space Station as it churns in the Atlantic Ocean towards the east coast of the United States, September 10, 2018. NASA/Handout via REUTERS\n\nClasses were canceled starting on Monday at the Wilmington campus of the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe U.S. military said it was sending an advance team to Raleigh, North Carolina, to coordinate with state and local authorities. It said about 750 military personnel would be designated to provide support.\n\nThe U.S. Navy said it was sending nearly 30 ships from coastal Virginia out of port to ride out the storm.\n\nOther military personnel, however, could find themselves directly in harm’s way.\n\nThe largest U.S. Marine Corps base on the East Coast, Camp Lejeune and its extensive beachfront northeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, lie within the NHC’s forecast “cone” for possible landfall.\n\nCoastal properties were especially vulnerable to possible flooding from the hurricane’s storm surge, which according to the California-based risk assessment service CoreLogic, will put more than 758,000 homes in the Carolinas and Virginia at risk.\n\nNHC Director Ken Graham also warned of “staggering” amounts of rainfall that may extend hundreds of miles inland and cause flash flooding across the mid-Atlantic region.\n\nForecasts call for 10 to 15 inches (25-38 cm) of rain in the hardest-hit areas, possibly more if the storm stalls over land, as expected, Graham said.\n\nVirginia’s emergency operations chief, Jeffrey Stern, told reporters that residents should brace for “something that no one in Virginia has experienced in their lifetimes.”\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)", "name": "Hurricane Florence nears Carolinas as 1 million-plus ordered to evacuate", "description": "More than 1 million people along the Carolina coast fled toward higher ground on Monday in a mass evacuation ordered three days before the expected arrival of Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 storm and the most powerful to menace the region in nearly three decades.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-florence/hurricane-florence-nears-carolinas-as-1-million-plus-ordered-to-evacuate-idUSKCN1LP096?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "id": "ea1c85f389e038c2647c0d603ba46db7f632b669", "keywords": ["carolina", "millionplus", "hurricane", "storm", "virginia", "north", "nears", "ordered", "florence", "coastal", "evacuate", "south", "carolinas", "residents"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T03:41:16+00:00"}

About 5,300 were lost in what is now North Korea.\n\nForensic anthropologists are combing through the remains at a secure facility on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.\n\nByrd and Jennie Jin, who leads the agency’s Korean War Project, explained the painstaking identification process which includes methods for finding DNA in bone fragments.\n\nSampling for DNA analysis has been carried out so far on about half of the boxes of remains, they said. Some bone fragments are as small as a quarter. Other bones have decayed so much that they are little longer than a pencil.\n\n‘HUGE BATTLE’\n\nHowever, the sets of bones from the two soon-to-be-identified troops are far more complete.\n\n“We noticed ... within a few seconds of opening up the box, and pulling him out, that we think this individual is African American and tall and slender,” Byrd said. “And that kind of realization that we have was made possible because of the relatively more complete condition (of the remains).”\n\nThe remains of both servicemembers came from the same 1950 battlegrounds near the Chongchon River in what is present-day North Korea. U.S. troops suffered heavy casualties there against Chinese forces that had intervened in the war.\n\n“It’s a huge battle,” said Jin, who estimated that 1,700 of the missing U.S. forces from the war came from that fight alone.\n\nShe spoke above tables of bone fragments, still separated with numbers corresponding with the 55 boxes.\n\nOther tables included personal objects from soldiers that don’t have any identification on them, including buttons, canteens and old boots.\n\nByrd acknowledged that it could take months for the next round of identifications. “There could be some more and maybe right after Christmas,” he said.\n\nJin, a South Korean-born American citizen, said the work has a personal connection. Her grandfather, now 90, is a survivor of the war who came from one of the areas of present-day North Korea that saw some of the heaviest fighting. He was evacuated south on a U.S. Navy ship, she said.\n\n“It’s really personal to me,” Jin said.\n\nThe July transfer coincided with the 65th anniversary of the 1953 armistice that ended fighting between North Korean and Chinese forces and South Korean and U.S.-led forces under the U.N. Command.\n\nThe two sides remain technically at war because a peace treaty was never signed.\n\nThe United States and North Korea conducted joint searches for remains from 1996 until 2005, when Washington halted the operations citing concerns about the safety of its personnel as Pyongyang stepped up its nuclear program.", "name": "First two U.S. troops from North Korean remains identified", "description": "The U.S. military has identified the first two American troops from 55 boxes of human remains from the 1950-53 Korean War that North Korea handed over in July, the agency leading the analysis said on Monday.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-remains/first-two-u-s-troops-from-north-korean-remains-identified-idUSKCN1LR05E?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "id": "cfc63440da744a2193d4da03b98efb34172eb666", "keywords": ["korea", "identified", "korean", "north", "war", "remains", "joint", "forces", "south", "troops", "jin"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T08:02:20+00:00"}

As he has throughout his political career, Trump is amplifying for maximum potency a more nuanced idea already coursing through the conservative ecosystem — just as he’s cast the press as an “enemy of the people” and dismissed NFL players who kneel during the national anthem in protest of police brutality.\n\n“What President Trump is an expert at is gauging what his supporters care about,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former White House aide. “This issue has really risen up — on par with issues like immigration, judges and the Second Amendment — in terms of issues that Trump supporters care about.”\n\nIn public comments and private conversations with his allies, Trump has often brought up the issue, bashing the San Francisco tech elites who he believes worked in 2016 to get his political nemesis, Hillary Clinton, elected president. It’s also become an official White House position, after the communications office distributed talking points last week to outside surrogates titled “Big Tech is Suppressing Conservative Voices.”\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe talking points, which were obtained by POLITICO, highlight a New York Times story about Facebook employees alleging on an internal message board that the company is “intolerant” of perspectives that differ with its left-leaning culture. The talking points also target Twitter for discriminating against Republicans by limiting users’ ability to find them in searches, and Google for showing the word “Nazism” next to search results for the California Republican Party.\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe tech companies have repeatedly rejected the idea that their platforms are intentionally biased. They argue that in cases where partisan leanings are detected in their algorithms, design choices or enforcement decisions, they are quickly fixed. The supposed record of bias, their defenders argue, is hugely anecdotal.\n\nBut conservatives have in recent years repeatedly pointed to signs that the tech industry’s liberal leanings are manifested in the tools it has built, typified by so-called shadow banning, or quiet suppression, of Republican activity on the social-media platforms.\n\nThe president’s embrace of anti-Silicon Valley rhetoric has been shaped by advisers who see it as the latest front in the country’s long-running culture wars and believe it has the potential to rally conservative voters ahead of the midterms and the president’s own reelection campaign in 2020. They include Brad Parscale, the manager of Trump’s reelection campaign; Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son; Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel; and Fox News personalities Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson.\n\nIn May, Parscale and McDaniel wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey demanding an end to “bias against conservative content.” Parscale and McDaniel met with Facebook executives in June alongside House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who conservatives see as another major conduit between the tech companies and the president.\n\nThe California Republican helped popularize the hashtag #StopTheBias, which has been picked up by Trump and top surrogates like Trump Jr. McCarthy has had several conversations with the president about social media bias, using personal anecdotes and examples of the companies' slanted treatment against conservatives to drive home his point, according to a Republican with knowledge of their discussions.\n\n“Conservatives invested a lot of money in building up their Facebook presences, and they did really well for a while,” Zach Graves, head of policy at the San Francisco-based right-of-center tech advocacy group Lincoln Network, told POLITICO. “Then Facebook changed the algorithm, and engagement dropped off a cliff. Now they’re practically worthless.”\n\nConservative allies of the White House have publicly suggested a range of policy remedies, including imposing government oversight of the tech sector by treating companies like public utilities. Another option being discussed informally in conservative circles: a push to eliminate tech companies’ protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits firms like Google’s liability for the content hosted on their platforms.\n\nRumors have circulated in Washington in recent days that the White House is workshopping ideas for a Google-targeting executive order. Several people inside the White House denied working on such a project.\n\nThe roots of conservative suspicions about social media can be traced back to a May 2016 report by the tech publication Gizmodo in which an unnamed Facebook source said the site’s in-house curators “routinely suppressed conservative news” in its trending news section. Coming at the height of the fraught U.S. presidential primaries — Trump was in the final weeks of sewing up the Republican nomination — the debate quickly became highly politically charged.\n\nThe president, who tweets avidly but doesn’t use a computer or consume social media himself, has repeatedly tweeted about his frustrations with tech companies, accusing Google of rigging search results to show only stories from the “Fake News Media” and Twitter “shadow banning” prominent Republicans.\n\n“[V]irtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,” Trump said in a Tuesday interview with the Daily Caller, accusing tech firms of interfering in the 2016 and 2018 elections.\n\nThe Justice Department signaled this week that it is taking the president’s concerns seriously. In a Wednesday statement, the department announced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is organizing a meeting, slated for Sept. 25, with state attorneys general “to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.”\n\nIn response to a Trump tweet criticizing Google last week, Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser, said the administration is even “taking a look” at imposing regulations on the internet giant, sending shock waves through the tech world as it scrambled to figure out what such a move might look like.\n\nTrump later appeared to walk back Kudlow’s comments, saying he wants “fairness,” not regulation — and White House officials declined to detail any policy other policy responses that are in the works. Current and former administration officials said they are often unsure whether the president’s Twitter pronouncements — from threatening to take away NBC News' license to looking into South Africa’s land policies — should be taken seriously and followed up with a suite of policy options.\n\n“Many of us operated on the assumption that this kind of stuff is just a PR, messaging ploy,” one former administration official said.\n\nDuring a Wednesday House hearing on the topic, Dorsey testified that while “we recognize that even a model created without deliberate bias may nevertheless result in biased outcomes,” as a company, “we believe strongly in being impartial, and we strive to enforce our rules impartially.”\n\nRepublicans, though, kept up their criticisms of the social network throughout the course of the hearing. Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana highlighted what he called examples of Twitter practices that seem to have “selectively adversely affected conservatives” — including an October 2017 campaign ad from Republican Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn that was temporarily rejected by the company over its mentions of abortion.\n\nThe following day, Twitter moved to permanently suspend provocateur Alex Jones and his far-right InfoWars, citing tweets and videos that violate its abusive behavior policy.\n\nSome close to Trump have started to worry that the president will undercut efforts to address the problems tech companies have already acknowledged by embracing some of the conspiracy-theory-laden elements of conservatives’ allegations against tech companies. One source close to the White House argued that Trump didn’t help his cause by tweeting out a video that falsely claimed Google didn’t promote his State of the Union addresses the way it promoted former President Barack Obama’s.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's critics see considerable irony in the fact that Twitter's most powerful user is complaining about bias when it has long been his preferred venue to tend to his grievances before an audience of more than 50 million.\n\nDemocrats dismiss Trump’s embrace of the attacks on major tech companies as politically motivated. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, accused Trump on Wednesday of peddling “conspiracy theories about Twitter and other social media platforms to whip up their base and fundraise.”\n\n", "name": "Behind Trump's obsession with social media suppression", "description": "Advisers have encouraged the president's view that Silicon Valley giants are part of a wide-ranging liberal campaign to undermine his presidency.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/08/trump-obsession-social-media-technology-811132", "id": "a4d781f81bbe9b06623bb24396a1d39d4dbfc372", "keywords": ["white", "conservative", "presidents", "president", "trumps", "companies", "trump", "suppression", "republican", "media", "social", "house", "twitter", "tech", "obsession"], "timestamp": "2018-09-08T00:00:00"}

The ICC's chief magistrate said in November that the body would look into allegations of torture and other abuses by Americans in the country. The sanctions could include barring members of the court from entering the U.S.\n\nBolton also warned the ICC not to investigate actions by Israel's security forces against the Palestinians that critics have called war crimes. \"While the court welcomes the membership of the so-called State of Palestine,” Bolton said, “it has threatened Israel — a liberal democratic nation — with investigation into its actions in the West Bank and Gaza to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks.”\n\n“[W]e will not allow the ICC or any other organization to constrain Israel’s right to self-defense,” Bolton added.

Earlier this year, Trump infuriated Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv — an affront to Palestinians who would claim at least part of Jerusalem for their future capital.\n\nPalestinian officials on Monday quickly rebuked the Trump administration. “We reiterate that the rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale, that we will not succumb to US threats and bullying and that we will continue our legitimate struggle for freedom, justice, and independence, including by all political and legal means possible,” a top Palestinian official, Saeb Erekat, said in a statement.\n\nThe Palestinian ambassador to the U.S., Husam Zomlot — who was recalled by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in May, shortly after the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem — blasted the administration’s announcement Monday.\n\nSpeaking of the PLO office closure, Zomlot said: “Such a reckless act confirms that the administration is blindly executing Israel’s ‘wish list,’ which starts with shutting down Palestinian diplomatic representation in the US.”\n\n“We stand firm in our decision not to cooperate in this ongoing campaign to liquidate our rights and cause,” Zomlot said in a statement. “Our rights are not for sale and we will block any attempts at bullying and blackmailing us to forgo our legitimate and internationally endorsed rights.”\n\nIn an apparent reference to the ICC, Zomlot added that Palestinians will \"step up our efforts to hold Israel accountable under international law.\"\n\n“[T]he PLO has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. “To the contrary, PLO leadership has condemned a U.S. peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the U.S. government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise.”\n\n“The United States continues to believe that direct negotiations between the two parties are the only way forward. This action should not be exploited by those who seek to act as spoilers to distract from the imperative of reaching a peace agreement,” Nauert added.\n\nThe administration’s rebuke of the ICC aligns with Bolton’s long-standing aversion to international institutions he views as violating American sovereignty. As an official in the George W. Bush administration in the 2000s, Bolton led opposition to U.S. membership in the ICC.\n\nIn his speech, Bolton laced into the court for what he called its vague definitions of criminality, lack of accountability and spurious claims of authority.\n\n“The United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court,” Bolton said. “We will not cooperate with the ICC, we will provide no assistance to the ICC, and we certainly will not join the ICC.”\n\nMatthew Waxman, a former State Department official in the Bush administration who worked on ICC policy, said: “This speech contains many of the same arguments behind the Bolton-led ICC policy during the early George W. Bush administration, but it amps up the threats against those who support the ICC or look to use it against the United States or Israel.”\n\n“During the Bush administration,“ Waxman addied, “there were other senior officials who worked to balance this policy with other interests, including holding perpetrators of mass atrocities accountable and managing friction with allies. So long as he‘s in office, Bolton will probably have a lot of control over this policy, and he is relentless.”\n\nA representative for Human Rights Watch on Monday lambasted Bolton's moves against the court as showing \"callous disregard for victims of atrocity crimes.\"\n\nLiz Evenson, associate international justice director for HRW, said in a statement: \"Any US action to scuttle ICC inquiries on Afghanistan and Palestine would demonstrate that the administration was more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers — and deflecting scrutiny of US conduct in Afghanistan — than supporting impartial justice.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Monday that, should the ICC open investigations into U.S. activity in Afghanistan, the administration would consider negotiating agreements to prevent nations from surrendering Americans to the court, and attempt to “constrain the Court’s sweeping powers” through the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThe administration would also weigh banning ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the U.S., sanctioning their funds, and prosecuting them in American courts, Sanders said.\n\nThe administration’s announcement comes days before the 25th anniversary of the Oslo Accords on Sept. 13.

That means sustained winds of at least 130 mph and expectations of catastrophic damage, the hurricane center says.\n\nLearned lessons\n\nAides say they are applying lessons from last year's spate of storms to an expected repeat season of destruction.\n\nA public face of last year's efforts, Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert , departed the administration in April. His replacement, Doug Fears, was previously a top White House official responsible for hurricane response efforts, helping to coordinate the government's response to last year's storms from his office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n\nOther top officials involved in last year's hurricane season, including Long and Nielsen, also remain in place.\n\nThat's left administration officials confident in this year's efforts, even as the White House's approach to last year's storms has drawn increased scrutiny. Initially hailed as a rare glimmer of competence in an otherwise chaotic and dysfunctional administration, the administration's hurricane response has since been re-evaluated. Questions have been raised over disparities in how the President responded to storms in Florida and Texas compared to Puerto Rico, where the official death toll was recently revised to nearly 3,000\n\nTrump last month defended his administration's work in Puerto Rico, despite the dramatically increased death count.\n\n\"I think we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico,\" Trump said during an exchange with reporters at the White House. \"We're still helping Puerto Rico.\"\n\nIt was an optimistic accounting of his administration's handling of the natural disaster, which left much of the US territory without power for weeks and resulted in thousands of deaths. The island's governor formally raised the death toll from 64 to 2,975 last month following a study conducted by researchers at George Washington University.\n\nAnd earlier this month, the Government Accountability Office released a report that revealed that FEMA was so overwhelmed with storms by the time Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico that more than half of the workers it was deploying to disasters were known to be unqualified for jobs they were doing in the field.\n\nLong said FEMA made changes to its priorities and procedures following some of those learned lessons.\n\n\"We are concentrating on what we call critical lifelines -- health, safety security. You know, we've got food, shelter, health and medical, power and fuel, communications, transportation, hazardous waste,\" he told reporters on a conference call on Hurricane Lane preparations last month.\n\nLong continued: \"We are hyper-focused on those seven critical lifelines because we realized last year that if any one of those lifelines goes down, then life safety is in jeopardy. And so we're reorganizing the firepower of the federal government underneath these critical lifelines, we're pushing forward.\"\n\nKey positions unfilled\n\nEarlier in the summer, Trump visited FEMA headquarters for a briefing on the hurricane year, a yearly tradition meant to demonstrate a President and administration with a firm handle on the meteorological challenges ahead. Trump spent much of his remarks introducing members of his Cabinet and hailing other areas his administration is succeeding.\n\nHe briefly returned to hurricane preparations toward the end of the public section of his appearance.\n\n\"We are marshaling every available resource to ensure maximum preparation for rapid response. That's what we had last year,\" he said.\n\nStill, key positions at FEMA remain unfilled, including a deputy administrator.

And he’s worried about his job.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe 48-year-old assistant roller at NLMK Pennsylvania says President Donald Trump’s steel tariffs have driven up costs for his company and left everyone at his western Pennsylvania plant — deep in the heart of Trump country — on edge.\n\n“Trump’s supposed to be making America great again, right? Why isn’t he creating more jobs here instead of taking jobs away?” Southward said in a new edition of the POLITICO Money podcast.\n\nSouthward spoke from his spot in the “pulpit,” a control room high above a conveyor belt that presses 10-inch-thick steel slabs into thin, rolled coils for resale. “We just want it to go away, man, so we can continue with our jobs. That’s all that’s talked about around here anymore.”\n\nStories like that of NLMK are playing out across the country from Iowa soybean farmers slammed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs to Michigan auto industry workers worried about the metal tariffs and the impact of proposed levies on imported cars and parts.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAs troubling headlines about the impact of tariffs pile up, Trump is preaching patience, repeatedly arguing that tariffs are “the greatest” and will eventually lead to better trade deals while reviving the steel industry and boosting U.S. automakers.\n\n“Just be a little patient,” he told farmers in Kansas City, Missouri, last month around the time he announced a $12 billion federal bailout for agricultural exporters hit by the fallout.\n\nBut patience is quickly running thin at places like NLMK, which buys steel on the world market. Company president and CEO Bob Miller said NLMK has paid an extra $100 million since Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on imported steel went into effect. He says he can’t buy the steel slabs he needs from domestic sources. And that means higher prices for his customers and ultimately consumers. His pleas to the Commerce Department for an exemption have so far come to nothing.\n\n“On one hand, you might think you’re helping jobs and increasing jobs, but on the other hand, you’re going to affect jobs here,” Miller said. “And I think our 1,200 jobs here in western Pennsylvania are just as important as jobs in Granite City or across this country.” He was referring to a steel plant in Granite City, Illinois, that reopened after the tariffs and received a visit from Trump in July to celebrate.\n\nDemocrats, sensing an opportunity to make inroads into Trump country in the industrial Midwest and farm belt during the midterms, are hammering away at the tariffs.\n\nNLMK lies just to the north of the western Pennsylvania district — which Trump won by more than 20 percentage points — that Democrats wrested back in a surprise special election victory by Conor Lamb in March. Democrat Amy McGrath is hammering incumbent Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) over the impact on Kentucky bourbon. And Democrats are also using tariffs in House races in New Jersey, Iowa and California and Senate races in North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee, among other places.\n\nThe political calculus — largely backed up by most empirical studies on the impact of tariffs — is that Trump’s trade actions will wind up hurting more industries and workers than they help.\n\nOne place they are helping is the Mon Valley Works – Edgar Thomson Plant, a facility owned by U.S. Steel on the banks of the Monongahela River in Braddock, Pennsylvania, that’s been in operation since 1872.\n\nPOLITICO interviewed more than a dozen employees arriving and leaving work and in the surrounding community over a period of two days. None agreed to provide their last names because they were not authorized by U.S. Steel to speak on the record. U.S. Steel executives declined requests for interviews. Most of the workers said they backed Trump in 2016 and were at least generally supportive of the tariffs.\n\n“A lot of people don’t like Trump. But Trump’s the one that’s turning things around the way it should be,” said Steve, a caster water control operator. “Everybody’s got to give it a chance to play out. Like China, they’re guilty. Other countries are guilty. We’ve been giving everybody a break for years upon years.”\n\nDan, who works in the shipping department at the plant, said the tariffs would benefit more than just U.S. Steel. “It’s not just steelworkers benefiting from the tariffs. It’s the food suppliers and the boot suppliers and the clothes suppliers and the parts suppliers that keep us running,” he said. “So it’s a trickle effect, and then our employees and everybody else that works with us make decent money.”\n\nBut even these workers, direct beneficiaries of the steel tariffs in the short run, expressed some concern over Trump’s long-term plan.\n\n“I’m not sure yet. Waiting to see. I don’t think a trade war is good with anybody. You know what I mean?” said Bob, who operates a machine that moves steel around the plant. “So we’ll see what these tariffs do, but I’m undecided on that. It’s too early to tell, OK? It’s good for individual companies — but the overall economy, I don’t know about that.”\n\nDave, who works in maintenance and production, said higher steel prices created by the tariffs might be unsustainable. “I think it’s going to help us in the short run, but I don’t know about in the long run if it’s going to help us,” he said. “The price of steel has doubled since he’s done that, and I don’t know if that’s going to last. Since I’ve been there, it’s never been nowhere near that price. So I’m just skeptical about the whole thing.”\n\nThere was also significant skepticism about Trump’s motivations in applying the tariffs, potentially an early warning sign for the White House, though the president’s overall approval rating among Republicans remains historically high.\n\n“I don’t think anything he does is going to help us,” said Mike, a contractor who does electrical work at the plant. “Everything I think he does is for personal gain.”\n\nThe problem for Trump and the GOP: There are a lot more workers in industries that use steel and aluminum than in companies producing them, tilting both the potential economic and political gains from the tariffs away from him.\n\nEconomist Jed Kolko estimates there are 415,000 jobs in companies that produce steel and aluminum while 4.6 million work in industries that use the metals, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAt NLMK in Braddock, which is owned by Russian steel giant Novolipetsk Steel, workers argue that Trump’s tariffs will indeed wind up hurting more people than they help.\n\n“It’s like a double-edged sword. They probably do need tariffs on certain stuff and it’s helping some people and hurting the other people,” said Robbie Smith, a roller who’s worked at the plant for over 20 years. “It seems like we’re the ones it’s going to hurt if they stick with it.”\n\nMiller, the CEO, said he could handle the tariffs for now, with the economy as strong as it is.

After speaking with over 2,000 high-net-worth families and business owners following an estate transfer, her firm found that 70% of the time the wealth did not successfully transfer to the wealth-creator's grandchildren.\n\nMore than half the time, she says, the breakdown is in trust and communication. A quarter of the time it's due to a lack of preparedness on the younger generation's part, and the rest of the time is because the family's values and mission are not clear. Rarely is the failure due to errors on the part of the family's financial advisers, she says.\n\nCarrie Schwab-Pomerantz, president of the Charles Schwab Foundation, senior vice president at Charles Schwab and daughter of famed investor Charles Schwab, has seen it happen to her friends. \"These are wealthy third-generation heirs of turn-of-the-20th-century wealth who were told by their parents that they would never have to work a day in their lives,\" she said. \"Instead they had to downsize their home, they had to go to work. It was not the life they were promised, because the money was gone.\"\n\nTalking to your heirs about wealth will help mitigate pitfalls and set them up to preserve and grow their inheritance for future generations.\n\nBuild trust and start communication\n\nParents are often concerned wealth will disincentivize adult children from their own pursuits and that siblings will fight over it or start to distrust each other.\n\n\"Normally, mom and dad hold the wealth tightly to the vest,\" says Castoro. \"They don't want to tell their kids about the estate plan. They distrust that the kids, even if they are in their 40's, are going to manage the money well. Often they just don't want or don't know how to talk about it.\"\n\nCastoro suggests holding a family meeting to discuss the structure of the estate with everyone over the age of 16, including spouses, in order to avoid any misunderstandings or suspicion about expectations. \"You don't have to give amounts, just the overall strategy you want to have implemented,\" Castoro said.\n\nIn addition to getting everyone on the same page, this is a chance to pass on lessons you've learned selecting advisers or developing long-term investment strategies. It's also important to discuss your priorities for the wealth whether it be paying for education, purchasing real estate or funding family vacations.\n\n\"As a facilitator, we use those conversations to teach the family how to reveal the distrust and start communicating,\" she says. \"When there is no trust there is no communication.\"\n\nPrepare your heirs\n\nSchwab-Pomerantz says ensuring the heirs are prepared, not only with financial know-how but also life savvy, is vital to a successful transfer.\n\n\"I would wait till their 30's,\" says Schwab-Pomerantz. \"I would tell them when they are well established and emotionally ready.\"\n\nBut financial responsibility should be taught early.\n\n\"It is about starting early with an allowance for work and putting value on the money\" she says. \"My kids all had summer jobs starting at 16. They need know-how to live on a budget and live below their means, even though they may have the money. And they need to understand proper investing strategies with a long term lens.\"\n\nCastoro says that wealth-creators need to be sure their heirs are prepared financially to manage wealth and see it is not a bottomless well but an opportunity for growth. That will also teach them to be independent rather than spoiled and pampered.\n\n\"Net worth isn't self worth,\" says Schwab-Pomerantz. \"The ultra wealthy can create kids that don't have the confidence to be the best adult they can be.\"\n\nDetermine values and mission\n\nIt's important to be clear about values that form your family legacy, says Castoro.\n\n\"Invite other family members to contribute what makes them proud to be part of the family,\" she says. \"For example, is giving important? If so, is it for animals, the environment, or medical breakthroughs? This provides an opportunity to create alignment around individual roles and specific actions people can take to contribute to the family wealth.\"\n\nThis is not a one-time statement, but tends to be dynamic and evolving for families.\n\n\"Hold regular family meetings to update changes to the estate, family business, access to assets, allow family members to present the charities of their interest, present business ideas.\"\n\nAlso, Schwab-Pomerantz says, it is very important to discuss the degree to which the older generation will help the younger generation while they are still living.\n\n\"In our family, older generations helped the next generation,\" she said. \"Everyone had careers and had to work. But they helped pay for our college and grad school and a down payment for a house. And now they are helping to pay for grandchildren's college.\"\n\nHave an investing question?

Andrew Cuomo is determined not to become the latest casualty of the progressive uprising of 2018 on Thursday — that’s why he’s spending feverishly in his primary campaign against Cynthia Nixon, trying to juice turnout through direct mail and touting infrastructure projects across the state.\n\nBut both camps remained on edge in the waning hours of the New York Democratic primary, as the volatility of this year‘s primary cycle hung over deep blue New York and the governor took sharp criticism for his campaign tactics after the state party machinery that he controls sent out a flier accusing Nixon of anti-Semitism — a move that appeared aimed at bringing some Jewish voters out to the polls.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCuomo, widely assumed to harbor presidential ambitions, is a notoriously fastidious campaigner, ever-mindful of his father Mario’s losing bid for a fourth term as governor, and sources close to his campaign said in that respect, this year is no different than when he fended off a primary challenge from Zephyr Teachout in 2014.\n\nNew York Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

And, so, because of that, I think they expect that they’re going to win. They didn’t take anything for granted,” Bill Cunningham, a former Mike Bloomberg aide who also worked for Mario Cuomo’s gubernatorial campaigns, told POLITICO. “The wild card are these new energized voters, how many are there, and will they show up if it’s raining.”\n\n\"You don't spend half a million dollars a day for the last several weeks if you're feeling good about your chances,” Nixon’s campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt told POLITICO by email.\n\nPeople working in the Cuomo campaign and sources close to the governor said they think Nixon, the former “Sex and the City” actor and activist, is a flawed candidate who ran a flawed campaign — a white, wealthy progressive woman who will have a hard time winning without the support of a majority of New York's black female voters, and who has failed to garner game-changing endorsements from political figures or any of the city’s biggest news outlets.\n\n“The press gave her a pretty good ride, and she’s making him a little crazy which is part of what she’s supposed to do,” one person close to the governor said. “If she’d been far better qualified, she could have really given him a run for his money.”\n\nAnother New York campaign operative put it more bluntly: “If Cynthia Nixon were black, I think Andrew Cuomo would be in a lot of trouble.”\n\nGoing into last weekend, people close to the campaign described the governor as fairly confident he would win his third term — his campaign has even scheduled a fundraiser for the week after the primary election. Cuomo has consistently held double-digit margins over Nixon in every poll taken in the race, and a new Siena poll out Monday showed the governor with a commanding 41-point lead over Nixon, an enviable cushion with just three days left until the election.\n\nBut 2014 is nothing like 2018. And in 2018, no incumbent is safe.\n\nNixon’s campaign has repeatedly pointed to the cases of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, who were down 35 points and 13 points in polling in the run-ups to their respective primaries in New York City and Boston, but who managed to topple longtime incumbent male congressmen with double-digit margins of victory.\n\nPolls like the Siena poll released Monday sampled heavily from older, wealthier voters who might not match the makeup of the electorate that shows up on Thursday.\n\nNew York campaign operatives pointed out that Cuomo hasn’t faced a primary race this competitive since 2002, when he famously crashed and burned in his gubernatorial primary race against Carl McCall; his behavior this campaign cycle suggests a candidate who is especially paranoid, they say.\n\nSources close to the governor say he feels he’s likely to win, but is still leaving nothing to chance.\n\n\"Our approach has to be ‘leave no doubt’ — we are not walking into this thinking we are winning,\" former Cuomo secretary Steve Cohen said. “That is very much the Cuomo view of how you can approach an election — leave no doubt.\"\n\nCuomo campaign sources say the governor has taken Nixon’s candidacy very seriously since she announced earlier this year, unlike Rep. Joe Crowley, who lost to Ocasio-Cortez in June after running what she described as an absentee campaign.\n\nThe Crowley election galvanized an already alert-Cuomo, a person close to the governor’s circle said.\n\n“If they had any tendency to be that way, the Crowley election probably caught their attention,” Cunningham said.\n\nCuomo almost immediately sought to neutralize the threat from Nixon earlier this year; since Nixon entered the race, Cuomo has announced his support for the legalization of recreational marijuana use and the imposition of a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags, and accelerated a timetable to force a group of renegade Democrats to rejoin the larger Democratic conference in the New York State Senate.\n\n“Very early on he understood that 2018 would be a very different year from 2013 or 2010 and that you can’t take any vote for granted — and you need to understand there are a lot of people who are looking for any reason to vote against the incumbent,” one Cuomo campaign source said.\n\nCuomo is burning through the nearly $40 million in cash he’s raised. In recent weeks, he’s blanketed MSNBC and ESPN with ads, spending $8.5 million in three weeks, over half of it on television ads featuring former vice president Joe Biden and touting his track record on women’s rights. At this point, Cuomo is on track to spend $20 million more on this race than he did in 2014, when he barely acknowledged the existence of his challenger, Teachout, and won the primary race handily, with $25 million left in his bank account.\n\nBut unlike 2014, this year is favorable for any Democrat in a general election, so the Cuomo campaign is less concerned about fending off Republican challenger Marc Molinaro in November. It’s his own party he has to worry about.\n\n“The primary is his Achilles‘ heel,” one operative said. “The calculation is we just have to get past the left and then we cruise to reelection.”\n\nAnd to “get past the left,” the campaign has to boost turnout among the rest of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn recent weeks, Cuomo’s campaign and the state party apparatus he controls have been investing heavily in direct mail, an effort that reflects the campaign’s understandable anxiety about voter turnout, outside operatives said. Primaries are typically low-turnout affairs. In 2014, total turnout was less than 10 percent.\n\nCuomo’s campaign is facing a foe of an unknown size — a potentially large quantity of enthusiastic new primary voters, some newly registered, some newly active, who might be backing Nixon’s candidacy.\n\nThe incendiary mailer sent out by the State Democratic Committee this weekend was likely aimed at New York’s ultra-Orthodox and Hasidic voters, who typically turn out in high numbers and vote as a bloc. Sources close to the campaign speculated the mailer was intended less to turn off voters to Nixon and more to boost turnout among Jewish voters, who might stay home if they think the race isn’t competitive.\n\nThe Cuomo campaign has assumed that if it can get black and brown voters to the polls, they’ll pull the lever for him. The big question mark is, will they show up to vote?\n\n“I think the momentum is definitely with Nixon, both with the electorate and with voters generally,” one person close to the campaign said.\n\nIt’s impossible to know whether Nixon actually poses a threat until election day, Cunningham told POLITICO. “You can’t control the new voters.

The response is so overwhelming that a lottery is held for the 140 or so available spots.\n\nFor 15 years, Tom and JoAnn Meehan never missed a reading of their daughter Colleen Barkow’s name at ground zero.\n\nShanksville: Trump honors 9/11 victims in Pennsylvania in rare role as consoler-in-chief\n\nCelebrities: Ice-T, Jimmy Fallon, Barbara Corcoran and more celebrities remember 9/11 on Twitter\n\nEvery year they would make the trek from Toms River, New Jersey, where Barkow is buried, to the site where she took her last breath to hear her name during the annual Sept. 11 commemoration ceremony at the 9/11 Memorial plaza in lower Manhattan.\n\nSometimes JoAnn Meehan said it: “Colleen Ann Barkow.”\n\nSometimes Daryl Meehan, the Meehans’ son, said it: “Colleen Ann Barkow.”\n\nThe crowd at the World Trade Center today. “We Will #NeverForget” pic.twitter.com/fvubqhVnzP — Svetlana Shkolnikova (@svetashko) September 11, 2018\n\nTom Meehan wants it said forever.\n\n“A veterans’ organization once said, ‘A person dies twice: once when they physically leave the world and another when their name is said for the last time,' ” he said. “That’s why it’s so important that this goes on.”\n\nFlowers were placed on the North Tower during ceremonies at the National September 11 Memorial on Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2018, observing the 17th anniversary of the attacks that killed people in Manhattan, the Pentagon, Flight 93 and honoring those who died in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

They stopped going to the ceremony last year because they are getting older and have health problems. They now watch the nearly four-hour event on television.\n\n“A veterans’ organization once said, ‘A person dies twice: once when they physically leave the world and another when their name is said for the last time,'” said one victim’s father. “That’s why it’s so important that this goes on.” #NeverForgethttps://t.co/e9oazx1VZs — Svetlana Shkolnikova (@svetashko) September 11, 2018\n\n“We’re grateful that they continue the practice of reading the names each year,” Tom Meehan said. “Prior to our daughter’s death, we had buried our parents, we lost an infant early in our marriage but none of those deaths prepared us for the manner in which Colleen died. This loss is unlike any other loss.”\n\nWalter Matuza did attend Tuesday's ceremony.\n\nMatuza, of Staten Island, New York, was just 10 when his father, also named Walter, died.\n\nPhotos: These iconic images from 9/11 are truly unforgettable\n\nIDs: 9/11 victim identification: 17 years later, largest forensic investigation in US history continues\n\nFive months later, Matuza started losing his eyesight.\n\nVision loss caused by hereditary optic neuropathy usually begins in a person's teens or 20s. Doctors blamed the early onset in Matuza on the stress of his dad’s death.\n\nThe pain of the loss got better, Matuza said, but hasn’t gone away. He wishes his dad could meet his new girlfriend, who also is legally blind. He wishes he could share the happy moments with him as well as the sad ones.\n\n“Seventeen years later, it’s still tough,” said Matuza. “I’m at a loss for words.”\n\nThe moments of loss were observed with six moments of silence Tuesday.\n\nThe first, at 8:46 a.m., marked the time when American Airlines Flight 11 struck the north tower.\n\nThe second, at 9:03 a.m., observed the time when United Airlines Flight 175 struck the south tower.\n\nAt 9:37 a.m., the reading of names paused to remember the time when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.\n\n9:03 a.m. The reading of victims’ names pauses to mark the time United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center on #September11th#NeverForgetpic.twitter.com/yagd7fSM5q — Svetlana Shkolnikova (@svetashko) September 11, 2018\n\nAn American flag is brought on stage at the World Trade Center and soloist Olivia Knutsen sings “The Star-Spangled Banner” to begin the #September11th commemoration ceremony #NeverForgetpic.twitter.com/gjVzHLcnvk — Svetlana Shkolnikova (@svetashko) September 11, 2018\n\nThen, starting at 9:59 a.m., three moments of silence within 30 minutes: the fall of the south tower, the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and, finally, the fall of the north tower.\n\nFollow Svetlana Shkolnikova on Twitter: @svetashko\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2x2TrDx", "name": "17 years after 9/11 attacks, families gather at ground zero to remember", "description": "The reading of victims' names was punctuated by six moments of silence to mark the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and Flight 93.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/09/11/september-11-families-gather-ground-zero-remember/1265653002/", "id": "37fbe264dea878ea557c403f07ec656b6c4669dd", "keywords": ["11", "shkolnikova", "gather", "attacks", "reading", "names", "families", "17", "zero", "ground", "flight", "world", "victims", "svetlana", "trade", "911", "remember"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence headed to the two other places where hijacked planes crashed on Sept. 11, 2001: a Pennsylvania field and the Pentagon.\n\nSeventeen years after losing her husband, Margie Miller went to the New York City ceremony from her home in suburban Baldwin.\n\n\"To me, he is here. This is my holy place,\" she said before the hours-long reading of the names of the nearly 3,000 dead, including her husband, Joel Miller.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania joined an observance at the Sept. 11 memorial in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where one of the jetliners fell to the ground after 40 passengers and crew members realized hijackers had taken control and tried to storm the cockpit.\n\nCalling it \"the moment when America fought back,\" Trump said the fallen \"took control of their destiny and changed the course of history.\"\n\nThey \"joined the immortal ranks of American heroes,\" said Trump.\n\nPence recalled the heroism of service members and civilians who repeatedly went back into the Pentagon to rescue survivors.\n\nThe terrorists \"hoped to break our spirit, and they failed,\" he said.\n\nThe 9/11 commemorations are by now familiar rituals, centered on reading the names of the dead. But each year at ground zero, victims' relatives infuse the ceremony with personal messages of remembrance, inspiration and concern.\n\nFor Nicholas Haros Jr., that concern is officials who make comparisons to 9/11 or invoke it for political purposes.\n\n\"Stop. Stop,\" pleaded Haros, who lost his 76-year-old mother, Frances. \"Please stop using the bones and ashes of our loved ones as props in your political theater. Their lives, sacrifices and deaths are worth so much more. Let's not trivialize them.\"\n\nThis year's anniversary comes as a heated midterm election cycle kicks into high gear. But there have long been some efforts to separate the solemn anniversary from politics. The group 9/11 Day, which promotes volunteering on an anniversary service in 2009, routinely asks candidates not to campaign or run political ads for the day. Organizers of the ground zero ceremony allow politicians to attend, but they've been barred since 2011 from reading names or delivering remarks.\n\nIf not political speeches, some victims' relatives made appeals to patriotism and support for the military and first responders as they read names. Mary Ann Marino said her family is humbled by the actions of first responders like her husband, firefighter Kenneth Marino, but \"our hearts still ache for what should have been.\"\n\nOther relatives laid bare the toll their losses had taken on their families. Thomas Langer said his brother, Timmy, \"drank himself to death\" over the grief of losing his wife, Vanessa, and their unborn child on Sept. 11.\n\n\"I witnessed my brother endure the pain that no one human being was ever meant to bear,\" Thomas Langer said, adding that he had struggled with despair himself.\n\nSept. 11 still shapes American policy, politics and everyday experiences in places from airports to office buildings, even if it's less of a constant presence in the public consciousness after 17 years.\n\nA stark reminder came not long after last year's anniversary: A truck mowed down people, killing eight, on a bike path within a few blocks of the World Trade Center on Halloween.\n\nIn December, a would-be suicide bomber set off a pipe bomb in a subway passageway near Times Square, authorities said. They said suspects in both attacks were inspired by the Islamic State extremist group.\n\nThe recent attacks scare Ruben Perez, who read names at the trade center Tuesday.\n\n\"I get very worried for the state of society. ... It's part of what it means to be human in the 21st century, a fear for public safety,\" said Perez, who was 6 when his uncle, Calixto Anaya Jr., died in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMemorials to 9/11 continue to grow at Shanksville, where the Tower of Voices will eventually include a wind chime for each of the 40 people killed there, and ground zero, where work is to begin soon on a pathway honoring rescue and recovery workers.\n\nIt will serve as a way to honor those who became sick or died from exposure to toxins released when the Trade Center's twin towers collapsed. Researchers have documented elevated rates of respiratory ailments, post-traumatic stress disorder and other illnesses among people who spent time in the rubble.\n\nAbout 38,500 people have applied to a compensation fund, and over $3.9 billion in claims have been approved.\n\nMeanwhile, a subway station destroyed on 9/11 finally reopened Saturday. In June, doors opened at the 80-story 3 World Trade Center, one of several rebuilt office towers that have been constructed or planned at the site.\n\nVictims' families, too, have evolved and grown.\n\n\"Even though I never met you,\" Isabella Del Corral said of her slain grandfather, Joseph Piskadlo, \"I'll never forget you.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves and Michael R.

Upgraded in strength on Monday, and threatening to become a Category 5 storm, the major hurricane has prompted evacuations from coastal counties in both Carolinas and Virginia. Current projections place North Carolina in the storm’s bullseye. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, you need to get ready for this storm now and you need to evacuate if asked to,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement. He cited storm surges along the coast, flooding from rains inland, and high winds statewide as reasons for concern about life-threatening dangers of the hurricane.\n\nThe latest @NWSWPC 7-day rainfall accumulation forecast has a solid stripe of 10+\" of rain across central #NCwx. This stripe may migrate, and ultimately could be a tad underdone if the storm lingers for longer than anticipated. Flooding is a major concern with #Florence. https://t.co/oYWfA7KQ68\n\nCooper has good reason to worry, based on past major hurricanes that have hit his state and those nearby hard, all doing damage in different, severe ways that took lives and cost billions of dollars in damages.\n\n\n\nExperts such as Nick Petro of the National Weather Service are pointing, in particular, to storms such as Hurricane Hugo in 1989 (the last major hurricane to hit South Carolina), Hurricane Fran in 1996 (the most recent major hurricane to strike North Carolina), and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as models for the mayhem threatened by the coming storm.\n\n\"Florence will be a large and extremely dangerous hurricane\"\n\nHurricane Florence threatens to pack the combined wallop of all three storms, with projected 20-foot storm surges along the coast, 145 mph high winds of a Category 4 (or higher) major storm, and more than 10 inches of heavy rainfall possible, dumping rainwater on the already sodden Eastern Seaboard. A high-pressure weather system developing north of the storm threatens to slow its progress after landfall, raising the specter of it parking in place like Hurricane Harvey last year over Houston, dropping tremendous amounts of rainfall, perhaps 20 inches, on North Carolina and Virginia. “The bottom line is that there is high confidence that Florence will be a large and extremely dangerous hurricane, regardless of its exact intensity,” according to a National Hurricane Center advisory.\n\nHurricane Hugo Public domain / Via upload.wikimedia.org Track of Hurricane Hugo.\n\nHurricane Hugo landed just north of Charleston, South Carolina, on Sept. 22, 1989, as a Category 4 storm with maximum winds of 140 mph, the most intense storm to hit the East Coast above Florida in the last century. At one time a Category 5 storm, Hugo followed a curling uppercut path that reached eastern Puerto Rico before steaming northward. When it hit the US mainland, it delivered a storm surge just above 20 feet high, enough to flood the cafeteria of a school in McClellanville, South Carolina, where people had taken refuge from the storm and had to climb to the rafters or stand atop tables to escape the rising water.\n\n\n\n“The enormity of the situation was staggering,” according to one survivor’s account. Sixty people died from the storm, 35 of them in South Carolina. Additionally, thousands of people were left homeless. Hugo was a fast traveller, however, which limited flooding from rainfall. It also meant it arrived over North Carolina’s Outer Banks still as a Category 1 hurricane, with gusts as high as 87 mph.\n\nHurricane Fran Public domain / Via en.wikipedia.org Track of Hurricane Fran.\n\nTracing a path similar to the one tracked by Florence, Hurricane Fran picked up steam crossing the Atlantic and roared past the Bahamas to become a Category 3 storm. Fran arrived ashore at Cape Fear, North Carolina, on the evening of Sept. 5, 1996, with 115 mph winds and up to 12 feet of storm surge. The storm delivered 79 mph wind gusts in the state capital, Raleigh, toppling trees and power lines more than 200 miles inland and dumping rain that led to dozens of dam failures. According to the Charlotte News & Observer, “the storm was a meteorological wake-up call for millions of North Carolina residents,” who had forgotten about the power of hurricanes to reach inland. Some 26 deaths resulted from the storm, and it caused about $4.1 billion in damages. The storm was so devastating that the name “Fran” was taken off the list of future storm names.\n\nHurricane Matthew Public domain / Via upload.wikimedia.org Track of Hurricane Matthew.\n\nA Category 5 bruiser that never quite hit the US mainland as a major storm, Matthew still dealt tremendous damage through flooding, in a 36-hour trek offshore that ended with its landfall as a Category 1 storm on Oct. 8, 2016, near unlucky McClellanville, South Carolina. Overall, the storm killed more than 600 people as it travelled from the Caribbean — the site of most deaths — to the US, and caused $15 billion in damages. The storm knocked out power and triggered evacuations from Florida to South Carolina as it powered up the coast. Its torrential rains caused widespread flooding in North Carolina and Virginia, with river heights cresting at record levels, feet above marks set by Hurricanes Hugo and Fran. Roughly 100,000 homes and other buildings were damaged in North Carolina alone.\n\nJoe Skipper / Reuters Homes partially submerged near Tarboro, North Carolina, after Hurricane Floyd.\n\nIn an analysis released on Monday, coastal geologist Robert Young of Western Carolina University compared possible flooding from Florence to the “flood of the century” left behind by another deadly storm. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd created a “500-year flood” that left whole towns underwater, their residents clinging to rooftops. Caskets floated from graves, and lagoons filled with hog farm waste overflowed, leading rescue workers to smear their noses with menthol ointment to kill the stench. Of 87 people killed by the storm, 52 died in the flooding in North Carolina. Ten years on, a burst of construction and increased population in the state makes inland flooding from Florence even more dangerous. Villanova University’s Stephen Strader noted more than 11 million homes are now in the cone of the storm’s projected landing zone inland.\n\nZoom in area of Myrtle Beach and Wilmington.

People drummed on their laps in disjointed spurts. Every so often, Hoffman jumped in the bellydancing circle forming in front of her and moved to the music before feeling self-conscious and hopping out again. Her friends were laughing, singing and cheering as day turned into night.\n\n“Typical Ren Faire downtime,” she described to HuffPost.\n\nIt was Hoffman’s third year at Ragnarok, a weeklong, immersive medieval-fantasy event that draws 1,500 self-described nerds and history buffs from all over the world to the picturesque grounds of Pennsylvania’s Cooper’s Lake each year, where they use foam-padded boffers and shields in a series of full-contact battle games. With her red curls and assured smile, the 27-year-old looks like Princess Merida incarnate, if the Pixar protagonist had black line tattoos stretching from her shoulders to her fingers.\n\nIn the thick of the medieval-inspired revelry, Hoffman said a man she’d once dated for three months approached her. According to Hoffman, he walked by and purposefully bumped his shoulder against hers ― “that dumb, I’m going to flirt with you by hurting you thing.” She pushed back, and he responded by challenging her to a grappling match, a sort of play-wrestling familiar to fantasy battle doyens.\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Hannah Hoffman at Ragnarok, June 23, 2018.\n\nDespite being under 5 feet tall, Hoffman holds her own on the battlefield, where women are the minority. So she accepted and the two began to wrestle publicly. Her small stature proved an advantage, Hoffman recalled, as she was able to slip out of his grasp again and again. Eventually the two tumbled to the floor and he climbed on top of Hoffman. She said she was trying to shoulder him off when he grabbed a heap of her long red hair and used it to slam her head, forehead first, into a tree root protruding from the ground.\n\nGrapplers typically adhere to established conventions to ensure they’re fighting in a fair and friendly manner. “It’s called having honor,” Hoffman explained. But she believes the man, who she said had acted condescendingly toward her since she broke up with him, had a chip on his shoulder that “wouldn’t let him lose to a woman.”\n\nAfter her face hit the tree, Hoffman “went limp.” Friends stepped in and broke up the fight. Some accompanied Hoffman back to her camp to make sure she was OK. According to her, blood was spilling from her nose and one of her pupils had become dilated.\n\nHoffman said that witnesses to the skirmish agreed that the man played dirty. And yet, most brushed off the act of violence as nothing serious, offering some variation of “he’s just an asshole” as an excuse. Because her friends were so nonchalant about the incident, Hoffman presumed Ragnarok security would feel the same way. She decided the attack wasn’t grave enough to get event officials involved.\n\n“I couldn’t wrap my head around why people weren’t taking it more seriously,” she said.\n\nA few days later, Hoffman went to the hospital. After an MRI scan, she learned that she’d suffered a concussion. To this day, Hoffman said that a hit to her head triggers a nosebleed like the one her ex gave her.\n\nHoffman’s account of her injuries in 2011 isn’t an anomaly. Over the past 10 years, she said she’s experienced both physical and verbal abuse at the hands of male Ragnarok attendees on multiple occasions. And she’s not alone.\n\nHoffman’s story echoes several other women’s accounts of a gender imbalance that permeates the male-dominated fantasy world. Over a dozen female participants at this year’s battle spoke to HuffPost on the record about the gendered harassment or assault they’ve experienced, often with no recourse.\n\n“Things happen to strong women specifically,” Hoffman told HuffPost. “To knock us down.”\n\n“This Is Our Week To Be Home”\n\n\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Dagorhirrim battle at Ragnarok, an annual live action roleplay battle in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania.\n\nHoffman’s experience in 2011 didn’t deter her from returning to Ragnarok, the largest event under the Dagorhir battle game umbrella. (Dagorhir, for those unfamiliar with Elvish, is the word for “battle lords” in J.R.R. Tolkien’s beloved series.) Every year, participants, also called “Dagorhirrim,” leave their day jobs and birth names behind, for one glorious week of role-playing, camping, crafting, partying and, of course, fighting.\n\nFor most attendees, Rag, as it’s called, isn’t just a whimsical excursion or silly pastime ― it’s a way of life. On site, Dagorhirrim answer primarily to “Dag names,” mythical personas complete with intricate backstories and genealogies.\n\nA 22-year veteran who goes by Sir Hamish, for example, explained that he was once a mere dwarf, born and raised on Mt. Fuji, until he unwittingly destroyed his grandfather’s katana ― a Japanese sword ― and was cursed to transform into a panda bear come nightfall. (He now identifies as a dwarf/werepanda.)\n\nDagorhirrim camp, fight and generally fraternize with their units ― chosen families of sorts that are united by shared values, skills and tastes in particular pockets of fantasy-historical lore. The “Blood Horde,” a society of orcs, prizes equality over all else. Meanwhile, “No Quarter!” ― inspired by pirate lingo ― prides itself on “eradicating the weak.”\n\nBy its nature, the medieval-themed event transports attendees back hundreds of years to a time when “women were subordinate to men,” as Lisa Bitel, a professor of history and religion at the University of Southern California explained. Most attendees vow not to talk about real-life politics, religion or other non-battle responsibilities during the course of the event, leaving the trials of life in 2018 behind. “Trump” is, in many units, an unutterable word, and the Me Too movement is still centuries away.\n\n“This is our week to be home,” a Blood Horde member who goes by the Dag name Bane told HuffPost. “The rest of the year we’re traveling.”\n\nHoffman ― whose Dag name is Leona ― was drawn to her unit, Sparta, because Spartan women historically had more freedom and power than their Athenian contemporaries; they were celebrated, rather than shamed, for being dominant and sexually active. At Ragnarok, however, Hoffman said these same qualities are met with resistance, disdain and sometimes even violence.\n\nFemale participants face the same double standards that plague women in the outside world, many expressed to HuffPost: Those who engage in sexual activity are often dubbed “fighting sex bots” or “Daga-hoes,” while women who don’t are labelled frigid and snobbish. In “non-com,” or non-combat, settings, colloquialisms like “tent is consent” color sexual activity, which frequently occurs under the influence of heavy drinking. Many attendees wear costumes and adopt personas during their time at Rag, which some interpret as a “blank check to act however they want,” participant Sev Gedra said.\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Ianje Castallanos and Sev Gedra, Queens of Ragnarok.\n\nThroughout our interviews, female Dags recounted inappropriate behavior on the part of the male peers that ranged from microaggressions to criminal offenses. Attendee Audrey Grace, who adopted the name Ishtar, spoke of an incident in which a man in the Roman unit was kicked out for exposing himself repeatedly.\n\n“It’s period accurate not to wear anything under your kitel,” she said. “But he continued to manspread.”\n\nAt this year’s Ragnarok, Grace said a man invited her to go back to his tent with him. When she declined, he proceeded to grope her waist and thigh, forcing his tongue inside her mouth until a male friend of hers interceded.\n\n“That was the point where I was like, I’m tired of being polite,” Grace said.\n\nAdrianne Marozzi, a former Ragnarok board member who goes by Silk, recalled the time a fellow attendee bragged publicly about surreptitiously taking her photo while she was having sex with her boyfriend in a tent on the campgrounds. He then gloated, according to Marozzi, that he masturbated to the picture.\n\n“Everybody just started laughing,” Marozzi said. “It didn’t occur to anybody that this was alarming behavior.”\n\nIn conversations with HuffPost, male attendees commonly rejected suggestions that the gender dynamics at Ragnarok were cause for concern. One self-described hobbit named Sun said, “For every greasy skid, there’s a bunch of people that care.”\n\n“We’re all nerds, so we’re not, like, shitty people,” he said.\n\nHoffman disagreed. “People think nerds are all chivalrous nice guys,” she said. “No.”\n\n“You Get Shamed Into Not Saying Anything”\n\n\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost A \"Welcome to Agarhoth\" sign at a camp entrance.\n\nUntil this year, when so many industries felt the foundation-shaking effects of the Me Too movement, many of the women we spoke to felt as though Ragnarok leadership was incapable of handling infractions when they occurred, leaving them feeling inconsequential and overlooked.\n\n“You get shamed into not saying anything,” Hoffman said.\n\nPart of this stems from the fact that Ragnarok operates like its own self-contained world. There are no police officers on-site, only volunteer public safety personnel and members of the event’s various local and national boards.\n\nThe bureaucracies that govern the national organization, Dagorhir, and its main event, Ragnarok, are convoluted. Dagorhir is organized by an elected board of directors (a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer and magistrate). But Ragnarok has its own board of directors ― which, for years was made up of a president and vice president ― as well as a business council that includes a secretary, treasurer and event coordinator.\n\nHoffman described the event’s leadership as a “shadow board,” suggesting its deliberately complicated setup muddled transparency and accountability.\n\nWithin Dagorhir, a magistrate-run war council composed of two representatives from each active participating unit is responsible for setting rules on and off the playing field and determining disciplinary action if necessary. Ragnarok, now in its 33rd year of existence, operates its own war council on top of that, populated by a representative from each active chapter, of which there are about 40 in total.\n\nHowever, despite the plethora of authorities, Ragnarok didn’t have a code of conduct outlining harassment and sexual misconduct until its 2017 event. Dagorhir didn’t adopt it game-wide until this year.\n\nDavid “Graymael” Vierling, president of the Dagorhir Battle Games Association since August 2017, confirmed to HuffPost that there was previously no system in place to outright ban offenders of sexual harassment or assault. But now that he’s president, he’s working on fixes.\n\n“When I became president, I inherited a number of issues,” he said. “What I have tried to do in my time in office is correct those issues and put in place steps to protect our membership from predators.”\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Rag attendees drink, dance and make merriment around the fire at an after-hours campout.\n\nFor many women, the lack of explicit penalties for misconduct smacked of tacit permission, especially when offenders of harassment or assault were “great fighters” or powerful “unit leaders,” Hoffman said. With a culture of silence and no direct support system for victims, women often kept the traumatic experiences they faced hidden.\n\nAs attendee Lauren Partlow, a vampire-elf hybrid who goes by the name Phoenix, put it, “they don’t know who to talk to and they don’t think they’ll be believed.”\n\nFor years, in lieu of official rules, Ragnarok attendees said they turned to self-policing and other forms of vigilante justice when misconduct did occur. In conversations with HuffPost, men and women agreed it was foolish to roam the campgrounds unaccompanied at night, lest someone act inappropriately.\n\n“You’re always going to get a drunk idiot,” a Blood Horde member named Vyce said.\n\nMany female Dagorhirrim referred to brother-type figures who would protect them and settle the score if anything unsavory occurred. An orc who goes by the name Fugdat told HuffPost he’d “stomp a mud hole in someone’s ass” if someone in his unit was hurt.\n\n“I travel with a mug that weighs about five pounds, that’s my self-defense,” said Dag regular Beckie Kindergan. “Drink goes in face, tankard goes in face, foot goes in nuts. You still wanna play?”\n\nEven Hoffman said her customary reaction to gendered abuse was to “beat the shit” out of the man who hurt her ― on the battlefield, that is. “Nothing is more embarrassing for someone who hates women than to get their ass whooped by a 4 foot 11 one,” she said.\n\nYet despite the lack of regulations or recourse, women continue to show up at Ragnarok, year after year, of their own volition.\n\n“This game has given me the opportunity to grow in ways I never thought I could,” a woman by the Dag name Candle, who’s married to a fellow attendee, told HuffPost.\n\nIn fact, many of the women HuffPost interviewed said they felt as safe, if not safer, at camp as in the outside world. “Jerks are everywhere, you know,” said Kathleen Brindley, whose Dag name is A’line. “Dudes who would catcall you on the street also join nerd games.”\n\nRagnarok, she added, felt less hostile toward women than many of her college classes.\n\n“Here we have a fighting chance,” Hoffman said. ”In real life, I have to worry about whether the guy has a gun.”\n\n“I Was Too Drunk To Stand, Let Alone Make The Choice”\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Gretchen Arnold stands on the battlefield at Ragnarok.\n\nBecause Ragnarok is an extremely tightknit community, rumors of sexual activity and misconduct travel fast. Hoffman recalled how, in her first years at Ragnarok, she landed a “horrible reputation” after having consensual sex with certain attendees.\n\nHowever, the familial bonds that unite Ragnarok also have their benefits. Women described maintaining a whisper network to spread word of men who should be approached with caution.\n\nIn more recent years, this whisper network has played out on social media, which provides a venue for allegations and discussions to unfold outside the fantasy realm. In June, Hoffman was scrolling through Facebook when she stumbled upon a post in which her friend, who preferred to remain anonymous due to potential repercussions, came forward with one of her “Me Too moments.”\n\nIn the post, she accused a prominent member of the Ragnarok community of molesting her when she was 12 and 16 years old. She warned her Facebook friends ― including her teenage niece ― to steer clear of the man, whom she described as “dangerous” and “trash.”\n\nHoffman was stunned. Not only because she had been friends with this man for years, but because, Hoffman said, she was raped by him at a party in 2017.\n\nMax, a pseudonym for the man whom Hoffman described as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing,” played an influential role at Ragnarok events, and according to Hoffman, was known to publicly expound upon the importance of heightened safety and transparency within the community. He presented himself, loudly, as a protector of women.\n\nHowever, Hoffman’s description of her experience with Max positions him as the opposite. When they both attended a house party not affiliated with Ragnarok in 2017, Hoffman said she blacked out from alcohol consumption. When she came to the next morning, Hoffman told HuffPost, she found herself on the lower level of the house, sore and covered in semen. Max was lying alongside her.\n\nHoffman was traumatized, she recalled. Max admitted to her that they had sex but refused to consider it rape, she said, first denying Hoffman was too drunk to consent, then blaming the offense on an alternate personality. Finally, she said, he claimed he too was blackout drunk. So she blocked Max on Facebook and cut him out of her life.\n\n“I never consented,” she told HuffPost. “I was too drunk to stand, let alone make the choice to have sex.”\n\nThe post accusing Max of sexual misconduct received over 400 comments. Other women shared stories of disturbing experiences with him, including rape. Hoffman said there were accounts that were almost exactly like her own.\n\nHuffPost spoke to burlesque performer Bella La Blanc, who commented on the Facebook thread. She told HuffPost that Hoffman was the third person she knew personally to accuse Max of sexual assault. La Blanc said she took care of another close friend who also described being raped by him.\n\n“Three people who don’t know each other, all with a similar story,” she said. “What do they have to gain?”\n\n“That person is a missing stair,” La Blanc concluded.\n\n“There Are Missing Stairs Everywhere”\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost A castle erected for various battles at Ragnarok.\n\nImagine one step among many that’s wobbly or broken. Instead of fixing it, people walk around it, quietly cautioning others to step over it to avoid harm. If someone does slip and get hurt, the blame falls upon her ― she wasn’t careful enough! ― or is framed as an unfortunate accident.\n\nThe term was coined in 2012 by a blogger who uses the pseudonym Cliff Pervocracy. In a piece describing sexual misconduct in kink and BDSM circles, he described a missing stair as “something you’re so used to working around, you never stop to ask ‘what if we actually fixed this?’”\n\n“Eventually you take it for granted that working around this guy is just a fact of life,” he continued, “and if he hurts someone, that’s the fault of whoever didn’t apply the workarounds correctly.”\n\nThe analogy took off. Members of niche communities from porn to paganism used it to describe members whose toxic behavior was willfully overlooked. At Ragnarok, “there are missing stairs everywhere,” Marozzi told HuffPost. It was up to attendees to “be smart,” as one participant put it, and avoid the lurking danger. Eventually, however, one missing stair became so glaringly treacherous, bystanders finally took notice.\n\nHis name is Ian Scott.\n\nScott, 33, of Bangor, Pennsylvania, attended Ragnarok and other Dagorhir events for years. In 2012 he faced charges of child pornography and sexual abuse, and later pleaded guilty to a charge of corrupting a minor in that case.\n\nIn 2014, the Ragnarok community got wind of the charges. Word of his alleged crimes spread fast, and a contingent of unit leaders pressured Dagorhir officials to ban him from future events, especially Ragnarok, which he frequented.\n\nBut there’s always been confusion among the war councils over who, if anyone, had the authority to officially eject Scott from all Dagorhir events and chapters, as emails from chapter officials and board meeting minutes provided to HuffPost show. But despite years of protests from the community, Scott continued to attend, until he was charged in 2016 for allegedly assaulting a fellow attendee on site. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in that case. He’s now in jail awaiting trial on a slew of charges unrelated to his affiliation with Ragnarok, including rape and corruption of minors.\n\nAfter the 2016 incident, Scott was officially banned from Ragnarok by that event’s war council. But for the attendees who urged officials to take action prior to his arrest, the dictate was too little, too late. At the time, attendees still had no national code of conduct outlining consequences for behavior like his, and felt as though there were few official avenues for victims of assault and harassment.\n\n“The Ian Scott issue was ugly,” said Steven Foster, Ragnarok’s event coordinator, whose Dag name is Timmourne. “He ended up being a known threat and no national action was taken until it was too late.”\n\nIn the shadow of Scott, Foster and a number of new faces on Ragnarok’s board of directors helped to pioneer structural changes he and many others felt were long overdue, including the institution of a nationally synchronized code of conduct for all of Dagorhir, the designation of a physical space for people who feel unsafe on Ragnarok grounds, and the creation of an official Ragnarok arbiter position, responsible for responding to and assisting victims on site.\n\n“We Went Out Of Our Way To Make Sure Our People Were Safe”\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Warriors march to the battlefield.\n\nIn 2018, every Ragnarok attendee received two items upon arrival: a silver pendant, or “Rag Tag,” that served as their ticket to the event, and a survival guide pamphlet, outlining the rules and regulations governing life within the camp.\n\nOn the survival guide’s table of contents ― a version of which can be found online ― the code of conduct explicitly outlines that “participants must refrain from actions that would limit or threaten another individual’s safe enjoyment of the event by another person or societal standards.”\n\nThe code contains mandates like “Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated” and “Consent is essential.” It explicitly states that people who are intoxicated or unconscious cannot legally consent, and that one can “withdraw consent at any moment you feel uncomfortable,” adding “just because you consent one time does not mean you consent to any future act.”\n\nThe code directs Ragnarok attendees to security and medic volunteers in the event of a safety concern. Additionally, if a Ragnarok attendee fails to adhere to these mandates, the code clearly outlines the consequences awaiting him or her. They range, depending on the severity of the incident, from mediation sessions between involved parties to the removal of individuals or groups from campsites to banishment from Ragnarok entirely.\n\nThe person responsible for determining consequences is the arbiter. Elected by Ragnarok’s war council, Foster hopes the adoption of the arbiter position will prevent communication breakdowns like the one preceding Scott’s arrest.\n\nLongtime Dag participant Lauren “Phoenix” Partlow, the vampire-elf hybrid mentioned earlier, was elected this year to fill the arbiter role, both because of her dedication to the magical world and her National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC) credentials.\n\n“In the event that anybody does something to another player that is severe enough to warrant official action, I’m ultimately the person that it comes to,” she told HuffPost. Partlow selected one of her fellow candidates, whom she declined to name, as her assistant.\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Lauren Partlow, aka Phoenix, took the \"arbiter\" position at Ragnarok to help victims of predatory behavior.\n\nIf someone comes to Partlow with an experience, her first job ― and the one she deems most important ― is to listen. “The vast majority of rapes are not reported because women legitimately believe that nobody’s going to believe them, because rape is the one crime where you have to first prove that a crime was committed,” she said.\n\nThen, she speaks with each attendee on a case-by-case basis about how she or he wants to proceed. Calling the hospital and police are both options, although Partlow said she respects a victim’s privacy should they not want to alert the authorities or leave camp. No matter what steps are taken, Partlow will alert the internal organization to what occurred, so all incidents will be documented and processed through a unified, streamlined system.\n\nAlthough she was only appointed recently, Partlow is optimistic that the arbiter’s very existence will discourage Dagorhirrim from crossing lines of decency.\n\n“This year I’ve really seen people step up and take care of each other in a way that shows a lot of maturity,” she said.\n\nWhen HuffPost visited Ragnarok in June, many attendees expressed that the event was in the midst of a positive transformation. But the community was also abuzz about an incident involving a female fighter who believed she was drugged at Thunderdome, a Ragnarok party described by one attendee as a “Mad Max rave.”\n\nAt Thunderdome, tricked-out guitars launch flames into the night as warriors “night battle” to boisterous applause. When we attended, the venue was packed with hundreds of people ― most of them drunk ― fire-dancing, singing and luxuriating in the most over-the-top party of the week.\n\nJohanna ― who asked to be referred to by a pseudonym ― was drinking wine out of a wide chalice she purchased herself for the occasion. Around 10 p.m., she recalled, she started to feel “really weird.” The sensation was like nothing she’d felt before ― drowsiness, dizziness, total lack of control. She told her friends what was happening and they accompanied her back to camp, alerted public safety volunteers and asked to speak with an arbiter.\n\nJohanna believes someone at Thunderdome slipped something into her drink, but has no idea who. She told HuffPost that friends and strangers were huddled around her at the party, and that she was drinking from an oversized cup that could have made it easier for someone to spike. Back at camp, Johanna began throwing up.\n\nParlow was dealing with another complaint that night, she said, and didn’t herself speak with Johanna. Another volunteer went in her place, though she declined to name who.\n\nJohanna said a public safety volunteer came to speak with her, but she doesn’t recall much of the conversation. The volunteer left without calling the police or the hospital. Johanna doesn’t remember whether she was asked if she needed either one, only that she passed out for three hours and woke up feeling better.\n\nWhen asked about the incident, Foster told HuffPost that the “individual was offered medical treatment, police intervention and talked to the advocate on duty.” Because Johanna dropped her drink while vomiting, Foster said, volunteers could not test it for rohypnol or other drugs.\n\n“But we went out of our way to make sure our people were safe,” he added.\n\n“Everything That’s Happening Nationally Is Happening Here”\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Attendees hug on the field while training for battle.\n\nWhile some attendees cited the Ian Scott debacle as the impetus for Ragnarok’s recent changes, others referred to the larger sea-change that has inflected nearly every industry, community and niche, especially those that are traditionally male dominated: the Me Too movement.\n\nIn interviews with HuffPost, female participants discussed how the Me Too movement has emboldened women to share their experiences without shame, and alerted men to the kinds of aggressions women will not tolerate.\n\n“Everything that’s happening nationally is happening here,” Gedra told HuffPost. “Women are speaking up more and men are believing them.”\n\nEven within Ragnarok’s mythology, women are asserting their power like never before. Every year, Ragnarok’s weeklong battle sequences end with what was formerly known as the King’s Battle, in which the two last men standing were crowned kings and reigned over the next year’s festivities. Last year, however, Gedra and another female fighter, Ianje Castallanos, whose Dag name is Fyxe, were the victors. Fittingly, in 2018, the same year sweeping changes meant to empower women were instated festival-wide, two queens reigned over Ragnarok for the first time.\n\nThe final fight is now known as the Monarch Battle in their wake.\n\nCastallanos ― one of the reigning queens ― said that pre-Ragnarok, she was an “indoor nerd” who felt uncomfortable in her own body. When she learned about the existence of immersive battles ― like video games in real life ― she was enthralled. “I wanna be Xena,” she recalled thinking. “That’s fucking dope.” The sport of combat helped her come into her own, channeling her joy and range into action and play.\n\nSimilarly, for Hoffman, Ragnarok isn’t just about the fighting or the parties or even the family she’s forged over the years. It’s about the ability to become the protagonist she never had growing up. “When I was younger, I loved Lord of the Rings, high fantasy and historical fantasy,” she said. “But there were never any stories about the women. I wanted to be a part of it more than anything. When I was younger, I thought I had to be a boy to do any of that. As I got older, I thought, I can literally write my own story. I knew I could keep up with the boys.”\n\nDespite the obstacles they’ve faced, the women we spoke to at Ragnarok unwaveringly expressed a deep love for the miniature world and the people who occupy it. By sharing their stories of harassment and discrimination, they made it clear that they do not want to take down Ragnarok, but instead elevate it through transparency. Their sentiments echo those of women in film, music, media, gaming, dining, art, porn and beyond, who hope to puncture cultures of silence, shame and complicity so everyone involved can feel safe and valued.\n\n“The Harder You Push, We’ll Push Back”\n\nMaddie McGarvey for HuffPost Ragnarok attendees preparing to battle.\n\nOn a Saturday afternoon, as the final moments of this year’s Ragnarok battle approached, there had yet to be a single incident warranting an ambulance visit.\n\nThat changed when, amid a tussle of limbs, shields, arrows and pseudo-spears, a flash of red hit the ground, hard. A cloud of warriors, elves, orcs and hobbits formed around Hoffman, who was lying prostrate on the grass. She’d cracked her rib earlier in the week during a wrestling match and, in the thick of fighting, felt something pop.\n\nBefore long, the sounds of ambulance sirens cut through the grassy meadow, reverting what was, just moments ago, a mythical land in the thick of Middle Earth back to its humble, more contemporary origins ― a lakeside campground in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe ambulance drove Hoffman to the hospital, where she learned she’d suffered a hairline fracture to the rib. The feeling, she told HuffPost, was excruciating. “I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t see,” she said. And yet just a few hours later, Hoffman was back at camp, determined to ride out the event’s final night.\n\n“I couldn’t let them see me get hurt and not come back,” she said.\n\nOn and off the battlefield, the women of Ragnarok are fighters.\n\nHoffman spent the night in too much pain to lie down, instead sitting on a lounge chair propped up inside her tent. But, she said, it was crucial to show her peers that no matter how much adversity she faced, she would not back down.\n\n“I have a right to be here,” she said. “All women have a right to be here. The harder you push, we’ll push back.”\n\nIn fact, all the pain she’s endured out of her love for Ragnarok has only intensified her commitment to its future. As she put it, “Every obstacle that comes up fuels this fire inside ― to be like, watch me.”", "name": "Among Cries On The Medieval Battlefield: 'Me Too'", "description": "At Ragnarok, one of America's most popular fantasy combat events, women face the greatest threats off the battlefield.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dagorhir-ragnarok-women-metoo_us_5b44e1afe4b048036ea31fcb", "id": "4366c308d97624905ad3049295550feb3c9e4a91", "keywords": ["battlefield", "huffpost", "women", "mcgarvey", "told", "dagorhir", "medieval", "attendees", "battle", "hoffman", "event", "cries", "ragnarok"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T08:00:16-04:00"}

He got his first campaign experience as a 14-year-old volunteer for Jesse Jackson in 1988, but the presidential candidate from that year with policies he eagerly cites is Steve Forbes, whose proposal to ramp up vocational training in schools has helped inform Jealous’ own platform. He may be the lone liberal Democrat running this year who says he doesn’t want anything to do with socialism—while still endorsing “Medicare-for-all” and free college tuition.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nJealous is the first major player to come directly off Sanders’ 2016 campaign and have done this well in a campaign of his own. He’s the first leader of the NAACP—from 2008-13, the youngest in its history—to be this close to winning statewide office. He’s a test case to see if someone with his kind of strident politics can win something more than a primary, even in a heavily Democratic state.\n\nWhile voters elsewhere in the country seem to be tilting blue, Jealous is running way behind in polls in a state that has elected only three Republicans governor in the past 60 years—and one of those was Spiro Agnew. Another of those three is the incumbent, Larry Hogan, the steady-as-he-goes moderate who regularly ranks among the most popular governors in the country, and who, if victorious, would be the only one of the three to win a second term. (The third Republican governor was Robert Ehrlich).\n\nJealous is sweating to persuade voters to ignore the attack ads that clearly make him angry. He’s a “socialist,” according to the Republican Governors Association ads inundating local TV, a man who’s “too extreme” for deep-blue Maryland. The spots have images of dollar bills literally on fire, amid complaints that Jealous doesn’t know how to pay for his ambitious proposals and would blow a hole in the state budget.\n\nFor all the talk of socialism in the current political moment, Jealous, who works as a venture capitalist, isn’t sure that many of those who throw around the term really know what it means.\n\n“It’s unfortunate if we get to a place where we believe that you have to be a socialist to simply want people to be treated in a way that’s just. I would not like to live in that country,” Jealous told me, in an interview for the latest episode of POLITICO’s Off Message podcast.\n\nIf Republicans are calling him a socialist the same way they called Martin Luther King Jr. a communist and Barack Obama a socialist, Jealous said, “in that context, I take it as a compliment.”\n\nHe insists he’s focused on Maryland more than what national implications will be read into the results.\n\n“The only burden I feel is to win—and we feel good,” he said.\n\nJealous’ campaign doesn’t have nearly the same kind of money that’s being pumped in for Hogan—at the end of August, the Jealous campaign had $386,000 cash on hand, compared with $9.4 million for Hogan, who’s also getting help from the RGA and other groups. What he does have are internal polls that show 25 percent of Democratic voters still don’t know enough about him to have an opinion on him, according to an aide who’s seen the numbers, but those voters overwhelmingly agree with him on health care, education and the general sense that there needs to be a shake-up in government.\n\nHis campaign is calling this a choice, much like it did during the primary he won, between the status quo and going big for new solutions. And much like in the primary, he’s running significantly behind. But unlike in the primary, he can claim justification in doubting the polls, since he was also well behind in June, and ended up winning by 9 points. His campaign, like those of Democrats all over the country, points to the high turnout during the primary—it was up 26 percent compared with 2014—as a promising sign for Jealous’ prospects in November.\n\nClick here to subscribe and hear the full podcast, including how Jealous’ father set him up to be friends with comedian Dave Chappelle by sending them pictures of each other as children.\n\nDon’t, no matter any of that, compare him to Donald Trump, Jealous said. Even so, with all the other upsets that have continued rolling through races this year, Jealous sees a common thread: “The people who are upsetting the pollsters’ prognoses right now are the people who are tapping into the pain in this country.”\n\nThe politician Jealous talks about the most is Franklin Roosevelt, who he sees as the right mix in his mind of principles and pragmatism. The marriage of those two, says Jealous, is how he arrived at “Medicare-for-all.” A few years ago in his day job with an investment fund, Jealous was trying to help a Canadian company relocate from northern Canada to Maryland. It wanted to, but couldn’t cover the cost of health insurance for its employees—a burden which businesses don’t carry in a country with publicly funded health care. He sees a “Medicare-for-all” system as both a moral imperative and a practical one that would help boost American businesses.\n\n“Medicare, we just have to admit, they leverage everybody in the system to get a better price on pharmaceuticals and they have a more stable price as a result,” Jealous said. “For me, it really is about business.”\n\nHe makes the same kind of argument about expanding education and the rest of his agenda. Most of his proposals look like they’re straight out of the left’s playbook, he says, and he does think about them as having roots in morality. But he swears, the policies he’s latched on to are all rooted in his idea of what works—where pragmatism meets principle.\n\nHe plays up being a nexus—someone who can live at the intersection of different worlds and can build bridges between them. It’s a theme throughout his life. He’s the son of a white man from Maine with ancestors who fought in the Revolutionary War and a black woman from west Baltimore whose ancestors include a former slave who became a Reconstruction-era statesman in Virginia. He grew up in California because his parents’ interracial marriage was illegal in Maryland, but spent every summer back on the Baltimore streets where his grandparents lived. He was suspended from college and then became a Rhodes Scholar; he was a social activist who is now an investor.\n\n“The people of America are suffering under the heavy weight of a bunch of half-measures, not quite ever solving the problem. They’re eager for authenticity, people feel really comfortable saying that. But what that really means with voters is they’re eager for you to tell them the truth about how we actually move forward,” Jealous said. “Right now, so much of life in America is better measured in debt than in prosperity.”\n\nThis article tagged under: Democratic Party\n\nOff Message", "name": "Can a Democrat Win in … Maryland?", "description": "Ben Jealous embodies the Democratic Party’s dilemma: Move left and embrace a surging progressive base, or shift right and capture the center?", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/11/maryland-ben-jealous-2018-off-message-219747", "id": "d532f280fc80d274022c5c644010848746e36763", "keywords": ["country", "really", "campaign", "win", "socialist", "primary", "hes", "jealous", "democrat", "maryland", "whos", "voters"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

With this week cut short due to the Jewish holiday, and the House on recess next week, lawmakers have just seven legislative days in which both chambers are scheduled to be in session before the government runs out of money.\n\nLeaders also have to dispense with a massive farm bill that’s been stalled amid a House-Senate clash over food stamps. House Republicans, with President Donald Trump’s backing, are still demanding work requirements for low-income beneficiaries — a controversial conservative proposal that has Senate GOP support but cannot attract enough Democrats to become law.\n\nFailure to pass a new farm bill by the Sept. 30 deadline could be a disaster: Republicans say it’s the best way to counteract the ill effects of Trump’s trade war.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe outstanding differences are so great that leaders have all but decided to sideline one of their original three “minibus” spending packages. The new plan includes passing the remaining two and simply extending funding for the rest of the half-dozen or so departments until early December in a so-called continuing resolution, according to three sources with knowledge of the plan. Senate leaders are still hoping they can finish work on the package and pressure the House to take it up.\n\nLeaders also haven’t ruled out extending the farm bill deadline to give themselves more negotiating time, though Republicans in both chambers say they hope they can avoid that. And tensions between the two chambers have simmered below the surface, as Senate and House Republicans blame each other for their slowed progress.\n\nHouse members “tend to want to do their own thing, but I think in the end the most important thing is to get an appropriations bill passed,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). “They’ve got their own prerogative, but the goal is to get the government funded and eliminate the drama.”\n\nRep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, had his own choice words for the upper chamber on the farm bill. “The Senate has taken a very hard-core position” against work requirements, he said. “You won’t see House language as passed but, by the same token, the Senate is going to have to give. We can’t just maintain the status quo. There is a compromise out there somewhere.”\n\nMeanwhile, GOP lawmakers are on edge, crossing their fingers and praying that Trump doesn’t shut down the government to get his wall before Election Day. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) seem confident that won’t happen, the latter predicting last week that there was “zero” percent chance of agencies getting shuttered.\n\nBut top appropriators like Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) won’t express the same confidence.\n\n“I would think he would [sign our bills],” Shelby predicted hesitantly. “In my judgment, it’s not in the president’s interest to shut down the government in any way. … That’s something I try to not think about.”\n\nThe legislative pile-up comes as rank-and-file GOP members are increasingly worried that they will lose the House this fall and are itching to hit the campaign trail full time. There’s been a notable shift in attitude among House Republicans, who once predicted a “50-50” shot at keeping the majority and now worry they are severe underdogs despite a buzzing economy.\n\nHouse Republicans say they’re likely to completely cancel their two-week session in October to campaign. Some were even hoping to do the same for the last week of September but now realize that won’t be possible.\n\nThere may be less imperative for the Senate to split early in October, with few vulnerable GOP incumbents and a host of nominations to process.\n\nStill, Senate Republicans, who have a more favorable congressional map this fall, are struggling to defend deep-red states after hoping to grow their two-seat majority. A rescue mission is now underway, for example, to save archconservative Ted Cruz in conservative Texas, and races in Tennessee and Arizona are too close for GOP comfort.\n\nYet in order to get out on the trail, lawmakers have to take care of legislative business first.\n\nTo do so, they’ve narrowed their legislative ambitions for the fall. GOP leaders had hoped to pass the three “minibus” spending bills — dispensing with nine of the 12 annual must-do appropriations — before the House leaves for its September recess. That turned out to be wishful thinking, and they’ve decided to focus on getting two over the finish line.\n\nBeyond scaling back appropriations plans, the Senate will not pass another tax cut bill or take another crack at Obamacare repeal, preferring instead to focus on confirming Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Also on hold are negotiations over provisions protecting staffers from sexual harassment.\n\nThe top priority remains funding the government. GOP leaders on Monday unveiled a final deal on their first “minibus” that funds energy and water projects and the VA. They had hoped to dispense with the bill last week but talks stalled over policy riders, including one helping vulnerable Washington state Republicans facing tough races.\n\nThe House hopes to vote on the agreement this week, though a looming Category 4 hurricane could upend those plans if votes are canceled due to severe weather.\n\nEven if Republicans pass the first “minibus” this week, both chambers still need to hash out a deal on the most contentious spending package: a military, labor and health care spending bill, where the House’s more conservative view on abortion restrictions clashes sharply with the Senate’s vow not to include “poison pill” riders in spending bills.\n\nBy sidelining the third “minibus” bill for now, GOP leaders hope they can get the defense-labor-health funding bill passed, since it includes the bulk of all government funding.\n\nThough the House is in recess next week, work among top appropriators is expected to continue remotely. Spending bill conferences, however, typically proceed more rapidly when both chambers are in session.\n\nThat leaves a lot for members to do after the House returns the last week of September, when Congress is also expected to pass a stopgap “continuing resolution” to extend funding for the rest of the departments.\n\nThe stakes are huge. Both political parties are eager to tap $36 billion in new funding for domestic and military spending from this year’s budget deal. And if the appropriations process falls apart, there may be less will to do a difficult budget deal next year.\n\nWhat’s more, if lawmakers are unable to pass their “minibuses,” they could be in for the nightmare scenario: a full shutdown before Election Day.\n\nTrump has sent mixed signals about whether he would veto spending legislation that doesn’t include wall money. GOP leaders know he wants to fight on the issue and has demanded $5 billion for construction, money Senate Democrats object to without a broader immigration deal. But they’ve asked him to delay his shutdown showdown until after the election.\n\nTrump has agreed to the plan, doing so as recently as last week in an Oval Office meeting with GOP leaders. But Trump has been known to change his mind. And there’s a hard-line contingent in the White House that believes the House is already lost and that Trump should fight on spending now, an attitude that worries many on Capitol Hill.\n\n“He has his view that this issue motivates the base, which it does,” said Sen.

The agreement has been interpreted over the years to set a 20-day limit on detaining children who entered the country illegally, and also requires facilities that house migrant children to be licensed by a state authority.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly referred to the agreement’s standards as “loopholes” that attract migrants by forcing authorities to release people pending their immigration hearings.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen repeated that reasoning, saying in a statement that “legal loopholes” prevent the government from detaining and deporting migrant families.\n\n“This rule addresses one of the primary pull factors for illegal immigration and allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress,” Nielsen said.\n\nThursday’s regulatory filing said the government would seek to terminate the Flores settlement, and put forward regulations it said “parallel the relevant and substantive terms” of the agreement.\n\nThe new rules would ensure “that all juveniles in the government’s custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors,” the regulation said.\n\nOne significant change would be a new licensing system to allow authorities to hold children in detention centers that are not licensed by state authorities to hold children.\n\nThe facilities would be licensed by an outside auditor employed by the Department of Homeland Security that would ensure the sites comply with standards established by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the regulation says.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union criticized the administration’s decision to withdraw from the agreement.\n\n“It is sickening to see the United States government looking for ways to jail more children for longer,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.\n\nThe administration earlier this year asked a federal court to ease the limits mandated by the Flores agreement, but the judge overseeing the agreement, U.S. District Court Judge Dolly M.

And again.\n\nThen, in July, a breakthrough: a complete DNA profile and a conclusive link to Scott Michael Johnson, a 26-year-old Montclair resident who worked on the 89th floor of the south tower as a securities analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\n\n“It was exhilarating,” said criminalist Carl Gajewski, a member of the unit.\n\nYasser Hernandez, a forensic scientist with the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, discusses the bone grinding process used to help identify remains of deceased victims.

(Photo: Amy Newman/NorthJersey.com)\n\nThe 10-person team made more than 100 identifications of 9/11 remains this year. Johnson was the only new discovery and the first victim to be identified since August 2017.\n\nAndrew Schweighardt, a criminalist with the unit, said the finding briefly paralyzed him. He heard a description of Johnson before he heard his name and immediately thought of his cousin, Joseph Anchundia.\n\nAnchundia also worked for a banking firm in the south tower. He was also 26 years old. His remains had also not been found.\n\nSchweighardt felt his heart seize.\n\n“Part of me is always hoping that one day, we’ll find something of him that we can recover,” he said.\n\nThat day could be a long time in coming.\n\nOf the 2,753 people killed in the attack on New York, 1,111 victims, about 40 percent, remain unaccounted for.\n\nNearly 22,000 human remains were collected from the rubble of the World Trade Center and surrounding utility manholes, roofs and streets between 2001 and 2010.\n\nMost were either whole bodies or tiny fragments, heavily damaged by the fiery crash of the planes, the pressure of the towers collapsing and the tremendous amount of water used to put out the smoldering wreckage, said Jay Aronson, an associate professor of science, technology and society at Carnegie Mellon University and author of “Who Owns the Dead? The Science and Politics of Death at Ground Zero.”\n\nMore: Deaths from 9/11 diseases will soon outnumber those lost on that fateful day\n\n“If you want to destroy DNA, the best way of doing it is with heat and moisture,” Aronson said.\n\nThe degraded remains did not stop the city’s chief medical examiner at the time, Charles Hirsch, from promising families that his staff would “do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to identify every victim of this tragedy.”\n\nSeventeen years later, the largest and most complex forensic investigation in U.S. history continues.\n\n“Our commitment to making these identifications is as great today in 2018 as it was in 2001,” said Mark Desire, assistant director of forensic biology for the Medical Examiner’s Office.\n\nJonathan Holly, a forensic scientist with the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, explains the first step of cleaning, examining and removing debris from bones in process used to help identify remains of deceased victims. The unit handles DNA testing for unidentified persons, including victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11. (Photo: Amy Newman/NorthJersey.com)\n\nIdentifications remain to be completed\n\nAs of early September, 14,549 remains, or 66 percent, have been identified, according to the Medical Examiner’s Office\n\nThe remaining 7,356 samples are either too damaged to extract DNA from or have produced DNA profiles that cannot be matched to a databank of 17,000 reference samples from victims and family members. About 100 victims have no references, Desire said.\n\nJohnson’s extracted DNA was compared with a sample from his toothbrush and confirmed with samples from his parents.\n\nMore: Wind chimes give voice to the heroes of Flight 93 two days before 9/11 anniversary\n\nRemains that have DNA profiles but are not matched to a reference sample or are unclaimed are stored in an underground repository beneath the World Trade Center site, Desire said. The repository is closed to the public and can be viewed only through an adjacent reflection room for victims’ families at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.\n\nThe medical examiner’s Charles S. Hirsch Center for Forensic Sciences holds some 4,000 unidentified, largely bone remains, said Timothy Kupferschmid, chief of laboratories.\n\nThey have been tested and retested up to 15 times, Desire said.\n\nYasser Hernandez, a forensic scientist with the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, discusses the bone grinding process used to help identify remains of deceased victims.

(Photo: Amy Newman/NorthJersey.com)\n\nBone is one of the toughest materials from which to extract DNA, he said. The difficulty is compounded by the bones’ exposure to fire, water, mold, bacteria, jet fuel and even sunlight.\n\nTechnological advancements\n\nForensic scientists in the city’s DNA crime lab, the largest of its kind in North America, could not generate DNA profiles for about 600 bone fragments this year, Desire said.\n\nBut they are not giving up.\n\nOngoing advances in techniques for extracting and identifying DNA samples continue to stretch previous limits of recovery, Desire said.\n\n“We know we’re going to be able to do stuff, even next year, that we’re not able to do today,” he said. “Every year, we’re successful on remains that we had no hopes for in the past.”\n\nMore: Man's remains identified as 9/11 victim using DNA test nearly 17 years after terror attack\n\nEvery identification made this year was impossible in 2001, when scientists had to manually grind bone samples into powder with a mortar and pestle, Desire said.\n\nThe Missing Persons Unit now works with a milling machine, which weakens the bone with liquid nitrogen and pulverizes it with a piece of metal.\n\nThe finer powder is more receptive to the chemicals that crack open cells to release DNA, Desire said, and allows for more DNA to be extracted.\n\nYasser Hernandez, a forensic scientist with the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, discusses the bone grinding process used to help identify remains of deceased victims. The unit handles DNA testing for unidentified persons, including victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11. (Photo: Amy Newman/NorthJersey.com)\n\nMany of the advancements in forensic science have been developed in-house by the DNA crime lab as a direct response to the difficulties in identifying 9/11 victims, Desire said. The new methods and technologies have helped with other missing persons cases and have been shared with labs and police departments working on highly degraded bones around the world.\n\n“Out of necessity, we’ve advanced the bone optimization protocol,” Desire said. “That has been one of the positives that has come from this.”\n\nThe Medical Examiner’s Office could not provide a cost estimate for the 9/11 identification effort, but Aronson, the Carnegie Mellon professor, pegged it at well over $80 million.\n\nAronson said Hirsch’s unprecedented promise in 2001 has placed an enormous financial and emotional burden on New York City and the Medical Examiner’s Office and forced remains to be kept in a repository reviled by many victims’ families rather than interred.\n\n“I don’t think that any medical examiner will make the same promise in the future,” Aronson said. “This was unique. It was a political decision, in part, and an emotional decision, in part, but certainly not what I would consider a rational scientific decision. At a certain point, you’re getting diminishing returns. You have to ask whether it makes sense to continue to do this and whether it adds value to the families and to the city and the country.”\n\nA repository for the unidentified remains of 9/11 victims sits behind a wall at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum inscribed with a quote from Virgil: \"No day shall erase you from the memory of time.\" (Photo: Svetlana Shkolnikova/NorthJersey.com)\n\nA sense of closure\n\nPeter Killeen, a stress counselor for Port Authority police unions who worked with families and officers in the aftermath of 9/11, said the return of remains provides a sense of closure for some but may offer little value for others.\n\n“Everyone grieves in their own way. Some people may have accepted the fact that they will never receive something of their loved one from that day and moved on as best they can,” he said, \"while other families are hanging on for something that will be returned to them.”\n\nDiane Horning of Scotch Plains received the remains of her 26-year-old son, Matthew Horning, twice.\n\nMore: 10 things you may have forgotten about 9/11\n\nShe collapsed when she was told of the first identification several years after 9/11.\n\n“When you get that notification, the reality is made tangible,” Horning said. “There’s always a part of you, if you don’t have any tangible evidence, that allows yourself to deny it, and once you get that call, you really can’t deny it anymore. You know it’s true.”\n\nThe Horning family decided it wanted to be notified of any future identifications. Some families choose never to hear from the Medical Examiner’s Office again.\n\n“I’m not sure if it’s anything I can intellectualize. It’s just a gut feeling,” Horning said of her family’s decision. “It’s like if you lost a loved one in an overseas war, you want them brought back home. The Medical Examiner’s Office has been very kind and diligent in giving us that option. We felt we wanted it.”\n\nA photo of Matthew Horning, a victim of 9/11, is seen on the briefcase of his father, Kurt, during the Empty Sky Memorial Ceremony at Liberty State Park on September 7, 2014. (Photo: Mitsu Yasukawa/NorthJersey.com)\n\nPerhaps a few years passed between the first call and the second, and the family was finally able to bury Matthew Horning in a cemetery.\n\nHorning said the Medical Examiner’s Office has not called in years.\n\nTom Meehan of Toms River said the recovery of his daughter Colleen Barkow’s remains six days after 9/11 provided answers to pressing questions.\n\n“In a small way, we know what happened to her, the manner of her death,” Meehan said. “Having that knowledge gives us comfort.\"\n\nMore: 17 years after 9/11, Afghanistan remains the war we can't win but can't afford to lose\n\nBarkow’s remains were cremated and buried.\n\nRosemary Cain considers herself fortunate to have been able to lay a small part of her son, Firefighter George Cain, to rest. But she believes more parts of him are among the unidentified remains and is dismayed that they have not been buried.\n\n“Those bodies are sacred,” Cain said. “Whatever’s left of their mortal remains is very sacred to a mother or a father or a sibling.”\n\nSally Regenhard, who lost her firefighter son Christian Regenhard, and Jim McCaffrey, who lost his firefighter brother-in-law Orio Palmer, have never received remains.\n\nThey no longer think about the possibility of getting them.\n\nThey focus their energy now on shutting down the repository by the museum, which they describe as a money-making tourist trap, and entombing all unidentified remains in an above-ground memorial akin to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nA memorial stone for Christian Regenhard, a firefighter who died in 9/11, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Manhattan. (Photo: Svetlana Shkolnikova/NorthJersey.com)\n\n“The important thing is not just identifying a fingernail, a sliver of DNA on a piece of dirt,” Regenhard said. “For me personally, the important thing is to have all these remains entombed in an honorable, respectful site so that I could say, ‘This is where you go if you want to pay your respects.’ ”\n\nThe only place Regenhard said she can do that today is at the Church of the Good Shepherd in the Bronx, where a small memorial garden contains a stone dedicated to her son.\n\nShe last went there on Aug. 26 to mark what would have been Christian Regenhard’s 45th birthday the day before.\n\nMore: FBI says agent exposed to toxins from 9/11 has died\n\nThe families of the missing live in a kind of suspended reality, Regenhard said. Without remains, there is no burial, and without a burial, there is no physical evidence of what happened to their loved ones.\n\n“The knife in the heart of any parent or anyone with a loved one is if there is no evidence that this person has died,\" she said, \"then there is no evidence that they ever lived.\"\n\nFollow Svetlana Shkolnikova on Twitter: @svetashko.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2x4HMEd", "name": "9/11 victim identification: 17 years later, largest forensic investigation in US history continues", "description": "In 2001, New York City’s Office of Chief Medical Examiner began the largest and most complex forensic investigation in U.S. history.

Unless you pay up.\n\nCount yourself lucky if you haven’t received this email or a similar one in the past few months.These so-called sextortion scams are on the rise, fueled by the past years' data breaches that have released personal information into the wild.\n\n“Anecdotally, it appears to be very prevalent,” said Cooper Quintin, a cybersecurity researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThe fraud banks on the chance that one of its potential marks – you, perhaps – has been visiting porn sites or has been cheating on a partner, and so believes the letter's sender really has secret information.\n\nOne such email claims that \"while you were watching the video, your web browser acted as a RDP (Remote Desktop) and a keylogger provided me access to your display screen and webcam. Right after that, my software gathered all your contacts from your Messenger, Facebook account and email account.\"\n\nWhat's more, it says you were recorded as you were viewing the porn. (“Yep! It’s you doing nasty things!” reads the scam letter.) If that weren’t enough, the email claims all of your personal contacts — family, friends, co-workers — have been stolen. Now the blackmailer is giving you 24 hours to make a payment, often several thousand dollars, via Bitcoin.\n\n“If I don’t get the payment,” the email continues, “I will send your video to all of your contacts including relatives, coworkers, and so forth.”\n\nAccording to Steven D’Antuono, chief of the FBI’s financial crime section, it’s what they call “a scare scam.” The FBI is seeing a rise in reported cases this summer, so much so that the Bureau issued an alert on the matter in August.\n\nWhat makes this scam different? Most phishing scams try to steal passwords, but this one already has your stolen password – and uses that information to try to reel in the victim.\n\n\"The messages are sent to email addresses exposed in previous known data breaches in which the user database (email address and password) was indexed online,\" said Brian Krebs, editor of the security news site KrebsOnSecurity.com.\n\nCindy Ratzlaff, a retired publishing executive, received the extortion email in early August.\n\n“The most frightening thing was that they referred to a password I once used,” she said. Her letter claimed to have a split-screen video of her watching porn, as captured by her computer’s camera. She knew it was fake — because she’s never visited a porn site and she keeps a green Post-it over the camera eye — “but it was still very concerning.” She told her husband, then immediately deleted the email, emptied the trash and rebooted the computer. As a final precaution, she then changed all her passwords.\n\nRatzlaff did all the right things, according to Eric Vanderburg, vice president of cybersecurity at Greensboro, North Carolina-based computer forensics firm TCDI. First, she avoided paying the ransom and then didn't engage with the threat.\n\n“It is best to interact with the email as little as possible. Do not click on any links in the message nor open any attachments, as this could infect your computer with malware,” he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Sam Fromartz, editor-in-chief of the Food and Environment Reporting Network, came home from vacation to find a typewritten letter sent to him by name via the U.S. Postal Service. If he didn’t send $8,000 via Bitcoin, the letter said, his porn-viewing video would be released to his wife.\n\nFromartz knew it was a scam – he doesn't watch porn – but what puzzled him most were the Bitcoin payment instructions. “It took up a full page and was so complicated. I wonder how anyone would decipher how to do it,” he says.\n\nThe addition of Bitcoin to the phishing blackmail is a new twist on old scams, the FBI’s D’Antuono says. Paying via Bitcoin is more anonymous than other methods, he says, because it’s nearly impossible to trace and, as he notes, once a payment is made “there’s not much you can do to get Bitcoin funding back.”\n\nWho’s behind these schemes, often referred to as “sextortion?” That's not clear. The FBI notes the scam could come from anyplace.\n\nI was curious to know if actual porn watchers were more at risk than others for being scammed. But cybersecurity experts say it’s an equal opportunity threat: one’s viewing habits have nothing to do with who is targeted. TCDI’s Vanderburg notes that victims are likely chosen simply because their name and password have been “exfiltrated” in a data breach. So if you've had your info stolen in a past breach, you may be more vulnerable.\n\nThe takeaway:\n\n· The EFF’s Cooper Quintin suggests practicing good “security hygiene,” which means regularly changing passwords and user names, signing up for a password manager like Dashlane, 1Password, or KeePass, and using two-factor authentication (which usually means responding to a text to your phone in addition to entering your username and password on a site as added proof that it’s really you).\n\n· Since laptops and many desktops are equipped with cameras and microphones, Vanderburg recommends covering the camera lens and adding a micblock to the microphone/headphone port on your computer.\n\n· The FBI’s D’Antuono recommends reporting any scams like these to IC3.gov, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, or contact your local FBI office (or toll-free at 1-800-CALL-FBI). “Predators are out there,” he says. “We need everyone’s help to stop this.”\n\n· Finally, “don't respond to spam at all, period,” says security expert Krebs. “Don't pay off extortionists.” In other words, be computer smart and think before you click.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Steven Petrow offers advice about living in the digital age.

It’s the latest instance of the Florida governor visibly tying his political fortunes to a prominent Republican other than the current president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nScott — who was frequently by Trump’s side at the White House and at his resorts in Palm Beach and Bedminster, New Jersey, in 2017 — began putting more distance between himself and the unpopular president this year as he geared up for a Senate run that Trump himself had repeatedly urged him to make. Scott also chaired the super PAC backing Trump’s 2016 presidential bid.\n\nNow Scott seldom mentions the president and won’t commit to having an event with him specifically.\n\n“I want everybody that believes in what I'm going to do to come help me win,” Scott told a Tampa Bay Times reporter last week when asked if he would like having Trump campaign for him.\n\nScott made the remarks in advance of a fundraiser headlined for him by Vice President Mike Pence. Scott skipped a July 31 Trump rally for GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis’ campaign for governor. In April, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Cory Gardner, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, also fundraised for Scott .\n\nScott isn’t completely snubbing the president. He flew down from Washington on Air Force One to Tampa with Trump in July and then accompanied Trump to an official presidential visit to Tampa Technical High School — an event where their exposure to TV cameras was limited.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

His net favorability rating is still a negative 4 points in Florida (and negative 16 points nationally) according to Quinnipiac University’s polling.\n\nQuinnipiac’s poll showed Scott is tied with Sen. Bill Nelson at 49 percent each.\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, has no choice but to stick by Trump, whose endorsement and full-throated support for the congressman helped him beat a once better-known and better-funded GOP rival, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.\n\n“Rick is doing what a sensible Republican should do — if he’s in a position to be able to do it, and Ron DeSantis isn’t in that position,” said a top Florida Republican who received the invite for the New Republican PAC events headlined by Bush. “This isn’t an F-you to Trump. But the president might see it as such.”\n\nIn a written statement, Scott’s campaign said the governor “is glad to accept the support of President Bush, Vice President Pence, and anyone who shares his views that we need to reform Washington. The governor appreciated the president endorsing his race when he came to Tampa in July.”\n\nAnother Republican familiar with the political operations of both Trump and Scott said it’s a “keep-away-from-Trump strategy. But Scott doesn’t want to be in-you-face about it. And you never know: He could announce a fundraiser tomorrow.”\n\nThe Friday fundraiser is separated into two parts: a 11:00 am private meeting at $25,000 a pop in Tampa and a reception in Palm Beach at 3:30 on the same day at $50,000 a pop.\n\nWith an eye on the November elections, Scott has also put modest distance between himself and the president in terms of criticizing Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policies that led to family separations at the border. Scott also moved more to the center by signing the first-ever gun control legislation passed in Tallahassee under Republican rule.\n\nThe Florida governor has long ties to Bush. Scott was once a minority partner with Bush in owning the Texas Rangers baseball team, which was sold to billionaire Tom Hicks, whose son and namesake is the chair of the New Republican PAC for which the president is fundraising.\n\nFew presidents know what it’s like to manage Florida Republicans during a midterm like Bush.\n\nIn 2002, Bush had no trouble at all attracting Republican support here and was sought-after as a surrogate as the country was united behind him after 9/11. His brother, Jeb, ran successfully that year for reelection to the second of his two terms.\n\nBut 2006 was another story. With the burden of the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina response weighing on the Bush presidency, Republican candidate for governor Charlie Crist skipped a Pensacola event with the president on the way to resounding win. Jeb Bush went in Crist’s place and wasn’t happy with Crist’s snub.\n\nAt the time, then-Senate candidate Katherine Harris was clamoring for help from Bush but the president, whose White House had expressed displeasure with Harris’s chaotic campaign and longshot chances, declined as she lost big to Sen. Nelson during his first reelection.\n\nNow Nelson, who has had relatively weak opponents, faces his toughest challenge ever from Scott.\n\nDaniel Strauss contributed to this report.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct McConnell's title.", "name": "Rick Scott plays ‘keep away from Trump’", "description": "The Florida governor seldom mentions the president anymore.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/10/rick-scott-trump-florida-813698", "id": "fa94e306b4b6b11cf6e12a3a3bc69130cbddd1ef", "keywords": ["president", "scott", "trumps", "campaign", "rick", "trump", "tampa", "republican", "florida", "governor", "plays", "bush", "away"], "timestamp": "2018-09-10T00:00:00"}

While both face the threat of flooding and downpours as the storm gains steam this week, it’s Miami Beach that has the most to lose.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFive Democrats with knowledge of the selection process tell POLITICO that at least some site committee members consider the race to be between Houston and Milwaukee. And that was before this week’s threatening weather.\n\nHeat, humidity and hurricanes were already among the factors weighing against Miami Beach. Some members worried about traffic and Miami Beach’s hard-partying reputation, which might muddy convention messaging. They’re also not crazy about the consideration of cruise ships as options for housing some delegates.\n\nFinally, there’s sensitivity to hosting yet another convention in the Eastern time zone while trying to portray a party that’s not anchored on the coasts.\n\n“Houston and Milwaukee are the only viable candidates right now,” a DNC member who had discussions with site committee members said before pointing to a variety of factors. “The weather, the logistics. Also, the imagery. What does the party want to portray from its convention? Do you want bikinis on the beach? Or do you want people in the heartland or a diversity of people in Texas?”\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nUltimately, however, the decision is up to one person: DNC Chairman Tom Perez.\n\nThe constant coverage of a hurricane threatening the East Coast comes as members of the national site committee are preparing to travel to Miami Beach next week to tour the city as a potential host site.\n\nDNC members on Monday were closely monitoring the hurricane’s path to determine if they need to reschedule next week’s tour.\n\n\"The DNC is conducting site selection visits with experts in various fields, including housing, transportation, infrastructure, security, accessibility, finance, and arena production logistics,” said Jess O’Connell, who is heading the convention site selection. “The DNC will then make a determination after these visits are completed about which city is best situated to host the 2020 convention.\"\n\nAs the climate discussion unfolds, Milwaukee officials couldn’t be happier. City leaders, in their pitch to host the convention, have repeatedly held up the city’s steady mid-summer weather as one of its chief assets.\n\n“Milwaukee’s weather in the summertime is second to none,” Milwaukee host committee chair Alex Lasry said. “You’re not going to find a better summer in the city than in Milwaukee.”\n\nFlorida DNC member Grace Carrington dismissed the weather as a concern, and held up Miami Beach as the city to beat.\n\n“I think the likelihood would be slim to none that [the weather] would affect our vying for that convention,” said Carrington, who is also a Broward County state committeewoman. “Miami is a hot place, the hotels are top-notch, the services are top-notch.”\n\nShe also noted that the last several major hurricanes took place much later in the summer.\n\nThat’s one silver lining for Miami Beach and Houston: the nominating convention will be earlier in 2020 than in past years — July 13 to July 16 — still within hurricane season but at a time when fewer major storms tend to come through.\n\nEven so, this week’s weather event served as a reminder of how Florida’s unruly weather has bungled political plans in the past. In 2012, the Republican National Committee lost a day of its Tampa-based convention because of the threat of a hurricane.\n\nWhile Houston was weathering a flash flood watch Monday, the DNC’s decision to hold an earlier convention in 2020 appeared to help Houston Democrats’ case. Storms with flooding are relatively rare in the Texas city in mid-July, the time of the convention.\n\n“You can’t rule out a hurricane or a tropical storm or flooding in July, but it’s relatively unusual to occur in July here in Houston,” said Dan Reilly, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “The peak of the hurricane season for us here is August and September, and we’ve had some significant June storms as well … but it’s pretty rare to get storms with flooding, certainly, outside the months of August and September.”\n\nStill, Reilly added, “It can happen any time.”", "name": "Hurricane Florence undercuts Miami Beach convention bid", "description": "‘Houston and Milwaukee are the only viable candidates right now,’ said one DNC member.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/10/hurricane-florence-miami-2020-dnc-813710", "id": "2258d13b9a3403aec5048f615d92206904e1bfd6", "keywords": ["hurricane", "houston", "site", "bid", "undercuts", "miami", "city", "weather", "florence", "dnc", "milwaukee", "beach", "convention"], "timestamp": "2018-09-10T00:00:00"}

This limitation was put in place to keep the major networks, who are also station-group owners, from having too much control over local news.\n\nThis was actually an increase from the limit set by Ronald Reagan’s Federal Communications Commission, which first instituted the ownership cap in 1985 at 25 percent. Since then, the idea that no one company should control a dominant number of TV stations has developed a strong bipartisan constituency. Democrats and Republicans have long agreed that a handful of TV networks operating out of New York should not control most of the nation’s TV stations and their local news programming.\n\nBut when Sinclair Broadcast Group proposed merging with Tribune Media in May 2017, it would have created a new company that reached 72 percent of all TV households in the U.S. This enormous reach was not what Congress intended. My company, Newsmax, along with many organizations on both sides of the political spectrum, opposed the Sinclair-Tribune merger.\n\nThe merger was dropped, but it is still too early to celebrate. Tribune is apparently for sale again, with its 43 stations back on the market, and we could soon face another titanic television conglomerate if the FCC doesn’t act soon to make clear that there are limits on how dominant a TV station group can be.\n\nWhat happened to the old limits? Sinclair was able to bid for Tribune and attempt to reach 72 percent of the country because in April 2017 the FCC re-instituted something called the UHF discount.\n\nThe UHF discount was an archaic regulatory rule that allowed television stations broadcasting on UHF frequencies to be counted at half their actual reach. In the past, this made sense, since UHF spectrum was considered to be inferior to VHF spectrum. Technology, however, has now made the rule obsolete because, since the 2009 transition to digital broadcasting, UHF signals are no longer inferior to VHF spectrum. In fact, UHF is now the preferred broadcasting frequency for digital television.\n\nShortly after the switch to digital—sometimes called the “DTV transition”—the FCC began a rulemaking to eliminate the UHF discount. According to the FCC, “the transition to DTV … undermine[d] the basis for the UHF discount” because it was “premised on the constraints of old technology.” The FCC formally eliminated it in 2016.\n\nBut then, inexplicably, the discount was restored in 2017—a move widely viewed as providing a loophole for Sinclair to skirt the ownership limit. If you “discount” the value of UHF stations, you can nearly double the size of the audience a single broadcaster is allowed to reach without the consent of Congress or a lengthy FCC proceeding to determine whether it’s in the public interest.\n\nPublic interest groups immediately filed for a stay of the decision and appealed to the federal court in the District of Columbia, arguing that it should nix the new UHF discount as inappropriate and dishonest. In July, the court ruled that the petitioners did not have jurisdiction in the case, without discussing the merits of their arguments. For now, the UHF discount remains in place, but its justification remains questionable.\n\nFortunately, the FCC heard the message of people like myself and many others concerned about the ownership limitation, and its chairman, Ajit Pai, began a new process to permanently eliminate the UHF discount, while simultaneously raising or eliminating the national television ownership cap.\n\nDuring the comment period that ended in March, Newsmax argued that if the cap was going to increase, a fair proportion would be about 50 percent of U.S. homes. Any number north of that would endanger competition and give large television station groups leverage to increase their rates over cable operators, thereby increasing consumer costs. These station groups would also have tremendous power to promote the cable channels they own over independent programmers like Newsmax, further undermining competition and diversity.\n\nThis issue should be resolved now. In addition to Tribune’s stations, Cox Media Group has indicated its 14 local TV stations are up for sale, and many station groups already butting up against the 39 percent cap are circling these assets. Before any more acquisitions and mergers get underway, the FCC needs to communicate a clear national standard—one that respects the ideas of localism, competition and diversity.\n\nCongress also has an important role and in the past has intervened to set the standard.\n\nMy own view is that the FCC should come up with the limitation number, and then Congress should ratify a new set of ownership restrictions. Until then, any new merger approvals should be based on the old limitation of 39 percent. The FCC and Department of Justice should not approve a major television transaction similar to Sinclair-Tribune—one that uses a technicality to blow through the old limits—until a new national standard is ratified.\n\nThe principle of limited media ownership is one I will continue to fight for. If another megadeal is proposed that goes above a 50 percent limitation, Newsmax will oppose it, as we did with the Sinclair transaction. After all, the best way to combat fake news is with more news, and more viewpoints. Diversity of ownership and reasonable limitations ensure that balance.\n\nChristopher Ruddy is the CEO of Newsmax Media, which operates Newsmax.com and the Newsmax cable television channel.", "name": "The TV mega-merger loophole", "description": "Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy says it’s time to stop offering a backdoor way for Sinclair to dominate local news.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/09/11/tv-station-mergers-fcc-000697", "id": "505404a50a14cdd65c3432595a1d104ce2f61bff", "keywords": ["tv", "television", "megamerger", "newsmax", "uhf", "ownership", "reach", "loophole", "discount", "fcc", "limitation", "stations"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

Olivia, a powerful storm in the Central Pacific, is expected to start crossing the Hawaiian islands Tuesday night.\n\n‘We are bracing for a hard hit’\n\nGov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said that the lanes of two major divided highways — Interstate 26 and U.S. 501 — would be reversed to make them one-way, carrying traffic only away from the coast for the mandatory evacuations starting at noon on Tuesday, and that two other routes might also be reversed if needed.

Roy Cooper asked President Trump on Monday to declare a federal state of emergency for his state. In coastal Dare County, the local emergency management agency announced a mandatory evacuation for all residents and visitors on Hatteras Island, the long, slender barrier island off the North Carolina coast, with a similar order to go into effect Tuesday for the rest of the county.

Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and professor of geography at the University of Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFirst, the coast faces high winds and storm surge from a powerful direct hit. But farther inland, he added, the probability of severe flooding is high if the storm stalls for several days once it makes landfall, as predicted. “The models are suggesting something very similar to what we saw with Harvey,” Dr. Shepherd said, referring to last year’s catastrophic flooding in Houston and elsewhere.\n\n“This is another example of a one-two-punch storm,” he said. And although people generally prepare for coastal damage, they may underestimate the flooding threat.\n\n“People have a hard time internalizing, preparing for something that’s outside their realm of experience,” he said. But Florence could bring conditions that people have not seen in their lifetimes. “It’s a dire situation that I believe is setting up,” he said.\n\nClimate change is leading to more destructive storms in a number of ways, Dr. Shepherd noted. “When we have a storm like Florence, it’s certainly going to be shoving higher sea levels onto the coastline,” he said.\n\nAlthough he said he was wary of linking individual storms to climate change, he added that scientific research laid out in authoritative documents like the National Climate Assessment of 2015 state that a warming climate increases the likelihood of “rainier storms,” with an increased risk of flooding.\n\nOther scientific research suggests that Florence is part of the trend of storms affected by climate change. A 2014 study in the journal Nature shows a “poleward migration” of intense storms, and further research links climate change to a “wavier” jet stream, which could contribute to weakened steering currents, a phenomenon that kept Hurricane Harvey over Houston and could stall Florence over the Carolinas, as well.\n\nSchools and government offices closing\n\nSchools were scheduled to close Tuesday in large swaths of North and South Carolina, with many of them set to serve as shelters for people fleeing the hurricane.\n\nIn South Carolina, Governor McMaster issued an executive order Monday closing all state offices and public schools, including state colleges, universities and technical colleges, in 26 counties threatened by Hurricane Florence. The closings would affect more than 430,000 students in kindergarten through high school, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state education department.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSchools on higher ground that have been designated as shelters will be serving food and staffed by the American Red Cross and other relief workers, he said.\n\nAlthough South Carolina schools are experienced at dealing with hurricanes, this one is expected to be the most challenging the state has seen in a long time, Mr. Brown said. “This is the strongest hurricane we’ve had since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. That was a direct hit to Charleston, Category 4.”\n\nIn North Carolina, schools in 17 eastern counties were expected to close, said Graham H. Wilson, a spokesman for the state’s department of public instruction. Most of those closures were set to begin Tuesday, but some were scheduled for Wednesday, and the timing of others was still to be announced.\n\nPhoto\n\n“We do anticipate more closings, once the path and severity of the storm is more certain,” Mr. Wilson said.\n\nPuerto Rico nervously watches Tropical Storm Isaac\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Tuesday morning that Isaac, now a tropical storm headed west toward the Lesser Antilles Islands, could be “at or near hurricane levels” on Thursday and on a path that might brush Puerto Rico on the weekend.\n\nJust word of a hurricane some 175 miles south was enough to send hundreds of panicked Puerto Ricans rushing to the store to stock up on water and supplies.\n\nPuerto Rico is nine days away from the first anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which crossed the Lesser Antilles before pummeling the island, knocking out power, damaging more than 300,000 homes and claiming some 3,000 lives over the subsequent five months.\n\n“The store was exploding —- exploding,” said Josefina García, a 64-year-old retiree who lives in Ciales. “The news said to prepare, so we’re preparing. I bought batteries and water, water, water.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Garcia said she was nervous, because her damaged roof still needed several sheets of metal to be fully repaired.

Only 1,642 of them, or about 60 percent, have been positively identified.\n\nThe New York City Medical Examiner’s Office has worked for 17 years to identify the remaining 1,100 victims. Using advances in DNA extraction techniques over the past five years, it has made five more identifications.\n\nThe advances have been bittersweet for 9/11 families who unsuccessfully fought to stop the city from making a park out of Staten Island’s enormous Fresh Kills landfill, where 1.8 million tons of Twin Towers debris was dumped and buried.\n\n“We are grateful that the identification continues, but there is more material that could have been part of that had the city not been so cavalier with us,” said Diane Horning, who led a failed court battle by a group called World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial that hoped block the park project.\n\nHorning led the group, although her son Matthew was one of those identified early on. Matthew, 26, a database administrator for an insurance company, was working the 95th floor of the North Tower when the planes hit.\n\nNew York’s Second Circuit Court of Appeals found in 2009 that accusations that the city had mishandled the remains at Fresh Kills amounted to “lack of due care,” which was not sufficient to successfully sue the city.\n\nNew York officials said at the time that the city did not intend to be insensitive or offend victims’ families.\n\nTo create the park, Fresh Kills Landfill was covered with layers of soil and other materials to prevent the release of toxic gas from decomposing trash into the atmosphere, according to the Freshkills Park Alliance, New York City’s nonprofit partner in developing the park.\n\nCharles Wolf lost his wife Katherine on September 11 and her remains have not been identified.\n\nIf they are in the sealed landfill, he considers it “God’s will” and he is “at peace” with it.\n\nTrays are pictured at the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York during an event in New York City, New York, U.S., September 6, 2018.

Dig everything up and risk exposing all those toxins again to the environment?, Wolf said. “No, that’s not the answer, because all of a sudden now the cure is worse than the disease.”\n\nSCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH\n\nThe ability to identify more victims is the latest chapter in a saga of pain that began on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when two airliners crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.\n\nDestruction of the Twin Towers was part of the coordinated hijackings of four airliners by al-Qaeda militants that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and western Pennsylvania, where one of the planes crashed in a farm field. The attacks triggered an escalation of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East that persists to this day.\n\nA scientific breakthrough in the extraction of genetic material was made this year and announced by the New York City chief medical examiner last week, as the 17th anniversary of the attacks approached.\n\nThe new technique places bone fragments in a chamber containing liquid nitrogen to make them more fragile so they can be pulverized into fine powder. The more a bone is pulverized, the more likely it becomes to extract DNA.\n\nIt is the latest effort in the largest forensic investigation in U.S. history, involving a medical examiner’s team of 10 scientists working on remains once thought too degraded from jet fuel, heat and other conditions to undergo testing.\n\n“We’re going back to the same remains that we’ve tried five, 10, 15 times,” Mark Desire, who heads the Medical Examiner’s crime lab, said in the briefing last week.\n\n“We are making DNA profiles from remains we had no hopes of identifying in the past,” he added.\n\nWolf, who was not among those who opposed the Freshkills Park project, was gratified by the renewed effort.\n\n“It warms my heart that possibly there will be remains found for people who still want them,” he said.\n\n“I’ve gone through a lot of trauma with nothing to grieve over,” Wolf said, choking up in a telephone interview. “I remember watching Nancy Reagan touch her husband’s casket.

That was Hurricane Hazel, which was already responsible for killing 1,000 people in Haiti and had winds clocked at 150 mph when it hit the coast in 1954.\n\n“Hazel stands as a benchmark storm in North Carolina’s history,” Jay Barnes, who's written books on the hurricane histories of North Carolina and Florida, told the Associated Press. “We had a tremendous amount of destruction all across the state.”\n\nHURRICANE FLORENCE'S PATH: TRACK THE STORM HERE\n\nHazel kept roaring past the coast and its winds had weakened only slightly by the time the storm reached Raleigh, 150 miles inland. Nineteen people died in North Carolina and an estimated 15,000 buildings were destroyed.\n\nIt didn’t stop there.\n\nSome 12 hours after landfall, Hazel continued swirling north to Buffalo, New York – ripping through a total of seven states with winds roaring at 100 mph or greater.\n\nJerry Helms, 86, was on his honeymoon on a barrier island off the North Carolina coast when Hazel hit on the evening of Oct. 14, 1954. He and his new bride had been to a roller skating rink and missed hearing the evacuation warnings from police officers who went door to door.\n\nHazel obliterated all but five of the 357 buildings in the beach community now known as Oak Island.

I just felt better about staying here than I did leaving.\"\n\nBy comparison, Florida, which is closer to the equator and in line with the part of the Atlantic off the African coast where hurricanes are born, has had at least five Category 4 or greater hurricanes in the past century -- including Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Tuesday, Hurricane Florence had sustained winds of 130 mph and was expected to strengthen as it continues to move over unusually warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean. Some forecasts show that it could strengthen to a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall Thursday.\n\n“Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday night,” the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe hurricane was centered about 975 miles east southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The center will move between Bermuda and the Bahamas on Tuesday and Wednesday and approach the coast of South Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nOn Monday night, President Trump approved an emergency declaration for North Carolina.\n\n“Heed the directions of your State and Local Officials - and know that WE are here for you.

Overall, Bonnie cost about $1.5 billion in damage as it ravaged North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nHurricane Fran; 1996\n\nOne of the most powerful hurricanes to hit North Carolina, Fran was a Category 3 storm when it made landfall around Cape Fear, North Carolina, on Sept. 5, 1996. While North Carolina bore the brunt of destruction from the storm, the size of Fran brought damage as far inland as Ohio, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nFran caused about $7.2 billion in damage at the time and was responsible for the deaths of 24 people in North Carolina, The News & Observer reported.\n\nHurricane Bertha; 1996\n\nA Category 2 storm, Hurricane Bertha made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina on July 12, 1996.

At the root of this fear and loathing is mutual incomprehension: Liberals simply don’t understand conservatives, and vice versa. In years past, the historical profession has done little to improve matters. Liberal historians typically treated conservatives and their ideas with disdain, when they deigned to notice them at all.\n\nThe end-of-century victories of Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich, however, forced historians to realize that conservatism could no longer be dismissed as a mere road bump on the inexorable progression toward a liberal future. The result, over the past two decades, has been a veritable tsunami of historical literature on conservatism. Virtually all of these works have been written by liberals. Nonetheless, historians of this new generation consider themselves to be unbiased and even sympathetic observers of conservatism. Many believe their collective efforts have produced a profound historical understanding of conservatism as an intellectual and cultural phenomenon, and thus contributed in some measure to bringing politically opposed citizens together.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nColor me skeptical. I was a graduate student at the beginning of this new wave of conservative studies and I couldn’t help but notice that it coincided with the historical profession’s purge of any scholars who could be described as Republicans or conservatives. Some of the new works on conservatism have been excellent, others awful. But nearly all reveal the pitfalls for liberals writing about a movement with which they have no personal experience. If you’re a historian who has not a single conservative colleague—and perhaps not even one conservative friend—chances are you’ll approach conservatism as anthropologists once approached tribes they considered remote, exotic, and quite possibly dangerous.\n\nThe result is that two decades’ worth of scholarship hasn’t contributed as much as one might have hoped to our understanding of conservatism, especially in the age of Trump. This is particularly true of the works that have been most popular with the broader public. That’s a shame, because historians could provide deeper answers than they have so far to the questions many citizens now wrestle with: How did our political system become so divided and dysfunctional? To what extent is the conservative movement responsible for Trump’s rise? What have been the movement’s greatest successes as well as failures, and what relevance do they have to our understanding of ourselves as a nation and a people?\n\nThose answers aren’t just relevant to our understanding of the past. A more robust, even-tempered account of conservatism is key to understanding what role the political and cultural phenomenon will play in our country’s future—whether liberals want to believe it or not.\n\n\n\n***\n\nA common flaw of the new political histories is to take the extreme right as representative of conservatism (or the Republican Party) as a whole. Lisa McGirr’s 2001 Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right was one of the earliest and best of these histories, but many of its readers came away convinced that the rabidly anti-communist John Birch Society dominated the Republican Party in the early 1960s, when it was a marginal element at best.\n\nThere’s little in McGirr’s scrupulously nonjudgmental account of the Birchers that alludes to their wild, conspiratorial fantasies, like the notion that the United Nations was training an army of barefoot African cannibals in Georgia to take over the United States, or that a “1313” committee of University of Chicago eggheads was plotting to deprive Americans of their rights to vote and hold property. Bircher-type thinking has had a resurgence on the present-day political right and points toward the enduring appeal of conspiratorial thinking in American life, so the organization merits study. But scholars should keep in mind that National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr., as part of his larger “fusionist” project that eventually led to Reagan’s election, branded the Birchers as “kooks” and was able (for a while) to keep them out of the conservative mainstream.\n\nThe success of Buckley and his “movement” conservatives at transforming the GOP into an ideological vessel has led scholars to overlook the internal party warfare between moderates and conservatives that raged throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and continues in a diminished form today. Some scholars also downplay the real differences that separate traditionalists, libertarians, paleo-conservatives and neo-conservatives, among any other number of ideological splinter groups. Like many liberal voters, they assume that the Tuesday Group faction in the House of Representatives is just like the Freedom Caucus, or that Speaker Paul Ryan’s beliefs are more or less interchangeable with those of President Donald Trump or Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\nIn fact, one of the more influential studies of conservatism, Corey Robin’s The Reactionary Mind, insists that such seemingly disparate figures as Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, Milton Friedman and Sarah Palin are all more or less the same, sharing the overarching goal of preserving the ruling order’s power and privilege against liberationist movements from below. In his view, the ideals conservatives tout (greater freedom, robust public morality, economic growth and deference to the Constitution) are nothing but fig-leaf cover for oppression, and anyone outside the elite who thinks otherwise is a victim of false consciousness. Robin—who, full disclosure, helped make my Ph.D. years miserable by leading a grad student unionization effort at my university—advances his argument with considerable force and erudition. But his reductionist thesis is the mirror image of the sloppy right-wing canard that liberalism is no different from socialism, or even communism.\n\nSome scholars bring their present-day political concerns to bear on the past, particularly in relation to the Republican Party’s approach to racial matters, assuming that it’s inherently a party of racial oppression . In this view, African-American demands for racial equality have always entailed a program of economic redistribution—and because such programs are anathema to both moderate and conservative Republicans, then by definition Republicans cannot support civil rights. Of course, this presentist position is at odds with the historical reality, which is that civil rights activists of the 1960s viewed the considerable majority of congressional Republicans as allies, and acknowledged that the movement’s great advances could not have been achieved without their help.\n\nHeather Cox Richardson’s To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party actually posits that the current GOP upholds the racist and elitist principles of the pre-Civil War slaveholding class. Richardson’s account is a mélange of liberal errors regarding conservative history. Like Robin, she dismisses Reagan’s populism as a screen for rapacious business interests. She contends that racism was the essence of Buckley’s New Right, and further that the Birch Society spread his ideas to ordinary voters. Buckley’s endorsement of Southern segregation was a moral blot on the conservative movement, and he later acknowledged it as his gravest error. But it’s anti-historical to assume that Buckley was little more than a Klansman with a large vocabulary, or to dismiss the monumental divisions on the right as minor quarrels within a united white supremacist alliance.\n\nSome of the most highly praised scholars of conservatism in recent years have openly acknowledged their political opposition to the movement. Rick Perlstein, whom New York Times columnist Paul Krugman recently pronounced “our leading historian of modern conservatism,” wrote a column a few years ago declaring “There Are No More Honest Conservatives, So Stop Looking for One.” Perlstein made a big splash in 2001 with Before the Storm, a well-researched account of Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign that even conservatives praised for its empathy and insight. But Perlstein’s subsequent works, Nixonland and The Invisible Bridge, portray conservatives like Richard Nixon and Reagan as cartoon villains, all but ignoring the progressive parts of Nixon’s record and the pragmatic dimension of Reagan’s.\n\nPerlstein’s treatment of conservatism is positively Solomonic, however, in comparison with Duke University professor Nancy MacLean’s Democracy in Chains, a 2017 National Book Award finalist that focuses on Nobel Prize-winning libertarian economist James Buchanan. In MacLean’s telling, Buchanan’s “public-choice” school of economics provided the intellectual blueprint used by billionaire Charles Koch to advance a “diabolical” and “wicked” plan to suppress democracy by handcuffing government—a crime to which the entire Republican Party is now, apparently, a willing accessory. As numerous critics from across the political spectrum have pointed out, MacLean’s conspiracy theory owes more to her strained interpretations than actual evidence, and her account is replete with errors and distortions.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIt’s true that the era when historians ignored conservatism or dismissed it as a curio is over; many universities now offer entire courses on its history. But a closer look at their syllabi typically reveals a paucity of writings by actual conservatives and a glut of hostile interpretations by writers such as Robin, Cox Richardson, Perlstein and MacLean. One teacher of such a course, Seth Cotlar of Willamette University, who was recently the subject of an admiring piece in Vox, apparently believes that the two major conservative intellectuals of the 1990s were Gingrich and Dinesh D’Souza—an error that no one who was personally involved with the conservative movement would ever make.\n\nGingrich was interested in ideas—particularly those of futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler—but he was primarily a political missile aimed at ending four decades of Democratic rule, a goal he would achieve by means both fair and foul. And from what I remember of the culture wars of that era, most conservatives I knew viewed D’Souza as a slippery but useful opportunist. His 1991 book Illiberal Education received wide attention because many people, not just conservatives, were worried about the universities’ drift toward political correctness. Even at the time, however, the leading critiques of higher education came from writers like Jacques Barzun, John Searle, Diane Ravitch, E. D. Hirsch, Alvin Kernan, Frank Kermode, Roger Kimball, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Charlie Sykes, William Bennett, and especially Allan Bloom.\n\nD’Souza’s demagogic instincts were held in check by his desire to appear in such company, and to satisfy gatekeepers like Buckley who wanted the movement to be respectable (and intellectually defensible). The Fox News Channel’s debut in 1996 did much to break down those restraints, with extremism and charlatanry becoming more promising career paths for would-be conservative talking heads.\n\nStill, the serious work of intellectual conservatism at that time came from thinkers who had little to do with the emerging political-media entertainment complex on the right—people like Christopher Lasch, Roger Scruton, Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom, Eugene Genovese, Charles Murray, Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele and Robert Hughes, to name a few. The ‘90s also brought in new voices on the neoconservative/neoliberal front like David Frum, Michael Lind, Andrew Sullivan, Francis Fukuyama, John McWhorter, Richard Brookhiser, Mickey Kaus, Michael Kelly, William Kristol and John Podhoretz.\n\nOf course, not all the works of that period’s conservative tribunes have aged well. Culture wars tend to produce more heat than light. Bloom’s musings on rock and roll seem as ridiculous now as they did then, and few conservative intellectuals still defend Charles Murray’s 1994 The Bell Curve, with its faulty conclusions on race and intelligence—though even fewer support the campus left’s attempts to prevent him from speaking on any other subject. The escalating polarization of the Gingrich era often overwhelmed any attempt at evenhanded analysis, and it’s hard to read the neoconservatives of the 1990s now without thinking of the Iraq War disaster looming on the horizon.\n\nBut the conservatives listed above were for the most part intellectually honest, dedicated to the effort of persuading the unconvinced, and capable of changing their minds in the face of conflicting evidence. Liberals who see the conservative movement as an unchanging monolith of oppression have a hard time understanding why many of the conservative thinkers of the 1990s now oppose Trump and believe the movement has become a shambles.\n\nLiberalism and conservatism have conditioned each other throughout their collisions over the course of American history, the ever-evolving yin and yang of our collective political consciousness. While the present moment may be an exception, American liberals and conservatives have almost always shared the same goals of peace and prosperity, although the means proposed for reaching those goals have usually been very different.\n\nOur current moment of crisis has further strained historians’ attempts to arrive at an impartial, penetrating understanding of American conservatism. Indeed, a growing school of academic thought believes that such a “disinterested” understanding may not be possible, or even desirable. It’s unlikely that a more nuanced history of conservatism will emerge until this latest culture war has run its course.\n\nIn the meantime, liberal historians should consider subscribing to the Claremont Review of Books or National Affairs, while conservatives should pick up some copies of the Nation or New Yorker. At least your anger will be better informed.\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice is director of political studies at the Niskanen Center and the author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party.\n\nThis article tagged under: History\n\nConservatism\n\nPolitical Thought", "name": "Liberals Don't Know Much About Conservative History", "description": "And both sides suffer for it.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/09/liberals-dont-know-much-about-conservative-history-219742", "id": "04eba25e32c9b07a5ebab59357d001a205e6ea45", "keywords": ["understanding", "liberals", "conservative", "know", "history", "historians", "conservatism", "republican", "conservatives", "movement", "dont", "scholars", "political"], "timestamp": "2018-09-09T00:00:00"}

Only one family member, then-3-year-old Vanessa, survived, but with severe facial injuries.\n\nThe Colorado Bureau of Investigation previously submitted a DNA profile taken from frozen evidence from Smith’s murder to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System. A match was found with evidence submitted by Aurora in 2002 from the Bennett case. The killer had sexually assaulted Smith and days later Debra Bennett and her young daughter.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, The Denver Post received a tip that a DNA match had recently been made between the suspect in the Lakewood and Aurora killings and a prison inmate in Nevada.

I mean, it’s real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the market place. ’Course don’t ever tell anybody that they’re not free, ’cause then they’re gunna get real busy killing and maiming to prove to you that they are. Oh yeah they’re gunna talk to you and talk to you and talk to you about individual freedom. But they see a free individual, it’s gunna scare ’em.”\n\nThis past weekend at Harley-Davidson’s 115th anniversary celebration, which drew roughly 150,000 bikers to events across Milwaukee, the strains of Easy Rider were still in the air. Nearly a half-century after the film’s debut, the motorcycle remains a symbol of freedom—a way into a world apart from the world, a world that’s freer, more primal, more alive. But today, there’s at least one new development: For many in the crowd, motorcycle culture translates to a full-fledged embrace of President Donald Trump, who they say embodies the same rebellious spirit. They defended the commander in chief, despite—or perhaps even because of—his public spat with their favored brand.\n\nAt Harley’s global headquarters, where bikers stopped for photos amidst their tours of the city, the word “FREEDOM” greets visitors as they enter, cut out of steel in seven-foot letters. Behind the reception desk are more cutouts: “MUSCLE” and “ReBEL” are the largest and most prominent, with “FREEDOM” and “BELONGING” bridging the gap between them. In a conference room where bikers mill about, a paragraph made to look like an American flag adorns the wall. “We don’t do fear,” it says, adding later, “Freedom and wind outlast hard times. And the rumble of an engine drowns out all the blah, blah, blah on the evening news.”\n\nIn Harleys, somehow rebellion and patriotism fuse together. The flag and the military loom large in the festivities. At the anniversary kickoff, three paratroopers jump from a Vietnam-era helicopter while a company spokesman reminds the assembled bikers that they are standing in Milwaukee’s Veterans Park. “That’s America right there, that’s incredible,” he says as the soldiers drift down with a giant flag, thanking them “for being the badasses that you are.” “We’re going to sing the national anthem, ladies and gentlemen,” the spokesman says when the soldiers are safely on the ground, “because again, we are celebrating America right along with this incredible American brand.”\n\nAfter the ceremony, I talk with Jerry Bellin, 60, a retired union ironworker who rode 90 miles here from his Wisconsin home. A long white beard extends down Bellin’s face beneath a confederate battle flag bandana. He wears the bandana, he says, because “it’s a rebel thing,” though he also says he wears it simply because a former tenant abandoned it amongst debris at an apartment he owns. The same word comes up when Bellin talks about the president. “He ran as a Republican, but I just like the rebel-ism,” he says.\n\nBellin shrugs off the president’s spat with Harley. Earlier this summer, Harley announced it would expand overseas production in order to evade E.U. tariffs levied as retaliation against Trump’s tariffs on steel. In a mid-August Twitter post, the president encouraged a boycott of the company. “Other countries do it to us,” Bellin says, referring to tariffs. “And we should protect ourselves. Without being racist or anything, but you see all the Asian people here? Look what kind of car they’re driving. They’re driving all Toyotas and Hondas and stuff. They protect their own country, even though they’re here. And that’s just the way it should be. Germans should be buying a German car, I think. Americans should be buying American.”\n\nI hear this kind of thing repeatedly over several days: support for the president and indifference about both Harley’s response to the tariffs and the president’s attacks on Harley—the company whose bikes, of course, everyone is riding and celebrating. Some of the bikers I speak with are unaware of any discord at all.\n\nA man wearing a MAGA hat and a Harley shirt on the fairgrounds, who gives his name only as Marty, says of the president’s call for a boycott of Harley: “Oh, I didn’t get involved in that too much. I don’t know. I really can’t comment on it. I can comment on some other stuff if you want me to. Trump’s the man. He’s got my vote and I’m proud of it and he’s doing wonderful things for our economy and our country.”\n\nDean Gilbert, 62, who traveled with his wife and son from North Carolina, calls the tariff issues “news media hype.” “I don’t think it’s as bad as the news media says it is. And I may be wrong, but look,” he says, gesturing to his bike a few feet away, “how much steel is there in a Harley? The beef was that tariffs on the steel are gunna raise the price of the bikes. I don’t know if I believe that.” As to the president’s call for a boycott, Gilbert says, “you’ll have a few people that’ll say ‘I just won’t spend as much,’ but if you ride a Harley, you’ll ride a Harley. It wouldn’t stop me from buying one.”\n\nAfter Chuck Lennon, 67, has his picture taken in front of Harley headquarters on his yellow chrome bike, he tells me he “would rather Harley not build overseas, but I can see why they need to.” Lennon, a retired engineer from Las Vegas, generally supports the president, but he would not boycott Harley. “Trump says a lot of things,” he says. “It’s OK. We elected him.” Lennon is more concerned about “a small minority of groups that are trying to either rattle or destroy this country” than about Harley or tariffs. “The worst part about it,” he says, “is I think half of the protesters you see that are out there, they’re actually paid to be demonstrators. I honestly believe that.”\n\nIn the Harley-Davidson Museum, a famous speech from another 1960s biker film starring Peter Fonda, The Wild Angels—“We wanna be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man. And we wanna get loaded.”—is featured prominently in a montage of old movie clips. So are scenes of Fonda, Hopper and Nicholson out cruising in Easy Rider, Fonda seated on his “Captain America” chopper painted with stars and stripes. A replica of that bike sits opposite where the montage plays.\n\nA flag hangs from a pedestrian bridge at the Harley-Davidson headquarters. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nI notice a man watch the seven-minute montage and then return to the video screen a short time later to watch a second time. Afterwards, I ask what the clips mean to him, and the man, a retired soldier from Texas who gives his name only as Jon, talks about Easy Rider and feeling free on the road when he got his first Harley at 14, now 46 years ago. Then the conversation turns to Trump.\n\n“I’m not really familiar with what’s going on with Harley and all that,” he says. He would rather talk about immigration, telling me that “Germany was a good place” before “Merkel let all the Muslims in from Syria and it changed the culture over there.” Now “that place is going to shit.” “People coming into this country,” he says, need to “do it legally, and learn our traditions. I don’t want to know their damn shit. I really don’t.”\n\nThis, of course, reflects a particular—and narrow—view of freedom, rebellion and patriotism. Harley, too, offers a particular view, one rich in paradoxes. The company sells a pre-packaged rebellion, a starter kit that offers just enough customization for each rebel, on his or her own bike and in his or her own logoed paraphernalia, to feel unique. It sells freedom by way of conformity, sells consumers a rejection of consumerism.\n\nHarley does all this at rapt attention to flag and country, rendering the rebellion less against “the man” and more against the danger of an ill-defined decline. It unites a tribe around the shared memory of a mythic time when freedom, rebellion and country all were a harmonious whole, embodied within the swashbuckling cowboy, a man beholden to none, free to roam and take whatever he thought was his.\n\n“Who among us would not want to climb on a machine dripping in freedom and American style?” Bill Thomas, 64, says when I ask him why he rides a Harley. We are seated with his wife Linda, 65, at a makeshift bar on a beach along Lake Michigan. Earlier there were Harley races in the sand. “To breathe the very air that collides with the chrome steel you ride? ’Cause all we want to do is be free to ride our machines, get loaded when we want to, and not be hassled by the man.”\n\nBill laughs as he acknowledges that he is borrowing part of Fonda’s speech from The Wild Angels, the same one playing in the Harley museum. But what really got him on a bike, he says, was seeing Easy Rider at a drive-in theater when he was 15: “Ever since then, all I wanted was a motorcycle.” Now, Linda chimes in, he has three in the garage at their Pittsburgh home. “All Harleys,” Linda says. “Is there anything else?”\n\nIt is fitting—ironic, too—that Easy Rider has taken on such a central role in the mythology of Harley-Davison. Late in the film, Hopper and Fonda sit by another campfire, this time without Nicholson, whose character has died in a senseless act of violence. As Fonda broods, Hopper tries to cheer him up.\n\n“We did it!” he says. “We’re rich, man. We’re retirin’ in Florida now, mister.” Hopper is recalling the opening scenes of the film, where he and Fonda are middlemen in a drug deal, selling cocaine to a man in a Rolls Royce for a bundle of cash. The bills are still hidden in the fuel tank of Fonda’s bike. But the reminder does not cheer Fonda. “We blew it,” he says to Hopper, grimacing. “We blew it.”\n\nThe bikers thought they were buying their freedom, but really they were selling out, trading in their ideals for an easy payoff from the establishment. And retiring to Florida is not exactly the stuff of biker lore. Their vaunted freedom, it turns out, was just a mirage, a fantasy. When Fonda and Hopper’s lives are taken in the film’s iconic final scene, they are not merely victims of the killers, but of themselves.\n\nAnd yet, at least among the aging generation that still makes up Harley’s core constituency, the fantasy lives on. Fonda and Hopper’s biker characters are heroes and martyrs who stand for freedom, a totem powerful enough that in its service both Harley and the president can be right, or close enough to right that the disagreement doesn’t really matter. “’Course,” as Nicholson said, “don’t ever tell anybody they’re not free.”\n\nJohn F.

It’s the ultimate testament to Nabokov’s mastery that so many readers find themselves sympathizing with a middle-aged man who kidnapped and routinely raped a 12-year-old girl ― and gets away with it.\n\nAs Sarah Weinman writes in her new work of nonfiction, The Real Lolita: The Kidnapping of Sally Horner and the Novel that Scandalized the World, “The appreciation of art can make a sucker out of those who forget the darkness of real life.”\n\nWeinman’s book, which hit shelves physical and digital on Tuesday, makes a sturdy case that Nabokov’s tale ― the one he claimed in interviews after its 1955 publication was pure fiction ― was in fact inspired by true events involving a real child named Sally Horner.\n\nWhen he was alive, Nabokov infamously refuted critics’ attempts to link Humbert’s abhorrent quest to “fix once and for all the perilous magic of nymphets” to actual events. What’s more, he insulted any “ferrety, human-interest fiend, the jolly vulgarian” who would dare ask.\n\nMore than 40 years after his death, Weinman is that vulgarian.\n\nAmazon The cover of Sarah Weinman's new book, featuring a photo of Sally Horner.\n\nThe Real Lolita introduces readers to Horner, an 11-year-old schoolgirl who lived in Camden, New Jersey. In 1948, she was approached by Frank La Salle, a convicted child molester freshly released on parole, at a five-and-dime store. After spotting Horner steal a five-cent notebook on a dare, La Salle passed himself off as an FBI agent and threatened to have Horner arrested if she didn’t follow his every instruction. Horner did as he said.\n\nAccording to Weinman, La Salle held Horner in captivity for almost two years thereafter, posing as her father by day and raping her by night, as they moved cross-country from Atlantic City to Baltimore to Dallas to San Jose, California. Horner finally escaped when a neighbor suspected the “family” relationship was fishy and called the cops. Upon being rescued, Horner was shunned by her classmates for the sexual activity forced upon her, smeared as a “slut” and a “total whore,” according to her sole school friend Carol Starts.\n\nAt 15 years old, Horner and Starts skipped town for a weekend getaway, taking the bus to Wildwood, New Jersey. Horner met a boy there, who was driving her around in his car in the early morning of Aug. 18, 1952, when he smashed into a parked truck. Horner was killed instantly.\n\nHorner’s kidnapping and death were covered by news outlets at the time. But little attention was given to the individual behind such a tragic fate. Horner’s name vanished from public consciousness long before that of literature’s prized nymphet entered into it.\n\nThe Real Lolita expands upon Weinman’s longform reporting, published four years ago in Hazlitt, which painstakingly pieces together the story of Horner’s brief and harrowing life. The author visited the places Horner lived and interviewed the people who knew her to create an engrossing narrative, occasionally consulting her own imagination to fill in the blanks left by questions unanswerable.\n\nSally Horner’s name vanished from public consciousness long before that of literature’s prized nymphet entered into it.\n\nHorner’s tale is interspersed with a chronological account of Nabokov’s process writing Lolita from start to finish. Along the way, she reveals evidence of Horner’s influence on his work, such as a notecard handwritten by Nabokov that directly references Horner’s abduction by a “middle-aged morals offender.” The parallels between Nabokov’s text and Horner’s life range from subtle to obvious.\n\nMost glaring is when Humbert asks himself if he had “done to Dolly, perhaps, what Frank Lasalle, fifty-year-old mechanic, did to eleven-year-old Sally Horner?” However, throughout her extensive interviews with ardent fans and critics of Lolita alike, Weinman found none among them recalled the line.\n\nThroughout the book, Weinman makes a careful distinction between Horner and contemporary victims of abuse and trauma ― like Elizabeth Smart and Jaycee Duggard, who published books recounting the horrors they lived through. They “were able to tell their stories the way they wished and when they chose,” as Weinman writes. “In doing so, they sought to make something meaningful of their lives.”\n\nBut the pain, complexities and humanity of Horner’s story were snatched from her the moment she became a fictional sylph ― as Humbert put it, “the little deadly demon among the wholesome children” ― not so much a person as an object of obsession. (For proof, look no further than SparkNotes’ description of Lolita as an “underage sexpot.”) Instead of Horner’s own account of surviving a predator, “we have the word of Humbert Humbert,” Weinman wrote in Hazlitt, “whose charm and erudition allows the reader to forget — briefly for some, completely for others — that he is a monster.”\n\nWeinman’s book includes a disturbing example of a publisher relaying his hopes to Nabokov that Lolita “might lead to a change in social attitudes toward the kind of love described in Lolita, provided of course that it has this authenticity, this burning and irrepressible ardor.”\n\nIs that the lesson to be learned of Sally Horner’s life story?\n\nHECTOR RETAMAL via Getty Images 'Fillette a la corbeille fleurie' by Pablo Picasso during a Christie's preview in 2018.\n\nIn writing Lolita, Nabokov inducted Horner into a long line of women and girls whose value as people is eclipsed by their role as “muse” or “inspiration” to an acclaimed male artist.\n\nEarlier this year, a 1905 painting by Pablo Picasso, titled “Fillette à la corbeille fleurie,” sold for $115 million at auction. It depicts a nude prepubescent girl who, despite the fact that art historians have rigorously researched the painting itself, experts know little about, save for the fact that Picasso called her Linda and she probably “died sadly young.”\n\nLinda occupies the same ghostly status of being “known and nameless” as Horner; a pretty picture, a compelling character, only remembered through the distorted lenses of a powerful man.\n\nMe Too revelations have, in part, prompted a reevaluation of this cultural condition, in which women’s lives serve as disposable nuggets of artistic inspiration off of which men profit. As a result, some dissenters, fearing for the fates of iconic artworks forged of this mold, have advised against ransacking our archives and holding old works up to “today’s standards.”\n\nBut Weinman’s book doesn’t excoriate Nabokov’s text or demand it be scrubbed from the cannon forevermore. Instead, she contextualizes his classic through an alternate telling of events, in which Horner is subject and not object.\n\n“Knowing about Sally Horner does not diminish Lolita’s brilliance, or Nabokov’s audacious inventiveness,” Weinman writes in her introduction. “But it does augment the horror he also captured in the novel.”\n\nThe Real Lolita is a revelation, not simply because of what it reveals about Lolita’s dark roots, but for the course of action it proposes. We don’t have to “cancel” every problematic work of art gifted to us by a male genius on high, but we can devote resources and attention to the lives sapped of their humanity for the cause.", "name": "It's Time To Learn The Name Sally Horner, 'The Real Lolita'", "description": "Vladimir Nabokov refused to admit his 1955 novel was based on a real child's tragedy.

As a result, my wife and I are in our early 50s and have next to nothing saved for retirement. Do we have any hope of a secure retirement?—John\n\nIf it's any consolation, you're not alone. When the Employee Benefit Research Institute asked workers as part of its latest Retirement Confidence Survey how much they had set aside for retirement, more than a third of those between the ages of 45 and 54 who answered said they had less than $25,000 saved, while more than a quarter of those 55 and older said they had less than that 25 grand tucked away.\n\nBut while your trepidation at nearing retirement age with very little saved is understandable, your situation isn't hopeless. You still have enough time to significantly improve your retirement prospects, if you're willing to start taking serious steps now. Here are the three most important things you need to do:\n\n1. Start saving your you-know-what off\n\nLet me be blunt about this. To go from saving virtually nothing to saving diligently is going to require real discipline and some major lifestyle adjustments. But unless you're willing to make a concerted effort to spend less and save more, your chances of being able to live anything close to your current lifestyle after you retire are slim.\n\nIf you do make the commitment to save, however, you can still come up with a pretty decent nest egg in the waning years of your career. For example, if you and your wife are able to save, say, $500 a month and earn a 6% annual return on that money over the next 15 years or so, you would enter retirement with a stash of more than $145,000, according to this savings interest calculator. If you can manage to save $1,000 a month, you'll be looking at more than $290,000. Obviously, the amount you end up with will depend on how much you actually set aside and what rate of return your savings earn. But the more you can sock away, the larger the nest egg you'll end up with.\n\nThat said, I don't want to suggest that you'll be able to save enough in the time you have left to put you on easy street. For example, based on the 4% withdrawal rule a nest egg of $290,000 would generate annual income of just under $12,000, or a little less than $1,000 a month. That won't allow you to live large. But it's probably enough at the margin to materially improve your retirement lifestyle.\n\nRelated: Do I really need a financial adviser?\n\nIf possible, you'll want to do most of your saving in an employer-sponsored plan like a 401(k), which, aside from its tax advantages, has generous contribution limits ($18,500 this year, plus a $6,000 catch-up contribution for people 50 and older) and makes saving easier by automatically transferring money from your paycheck to your account. If you don't have access to a 401(k), you can open an IRA, which allows you to set aside up to $5,500 a year, plus an extra $1,000 for people 50 and older. But whether you save in a 401(k), an IRA, a taxable account or some combination of those three, the point is that the sooner you start doing so and the more you put away, the better your chances of having a secure retirement will be.\n\nA quick note on investing your savings: You may be tempted to invest aggressively to earn higher returns and boost the value of your nest egg. Resist that urge. If the market goes into a major downturn, that strategy can backfire and leave you saddled with big losses that you may not have enough time to recover from by the time you retire. A better approach is to build a diversified portfolio of low-cost stock and bond funds that provides a shot at reasonable investment gains consistent with your tolerance for risk.\n\n2. Stay on the job longer\n\nIn a recent study titled \"The Power of Working Longer,\" retirement researchers showed that postponing retirement and continuing to work can be one of the most effective ways of boosting your post-career standard of living, often more helpful than increasing your savings rate.\n\nThe main reason is that to the extent staying in the workforce allows you to delay claiming Social Security, you can qualify for a larger monthly Social Security check down the road. For example, each year between the age of 62 and 70 that you put off collecting Social Security, you increase your benefit by roughly 7% to 8%. (You receive no increase for delaying beyond age 70.) And since the money you earn during those extra working years also counts in determining your benefit, the amount you receive could increase even more, which means delaying just a few years might boost your eventual payment by 20% to 25%, if not more. To see how much your monthly benefit might rise by working longer, you can to Social Security's Retirement Estimator.\n\nContinuing to work can help in other ways too. You have more years to salt away money for retirement, and your nest egg has more time to rack up investment gains and grow before you tap it. And, of course, any extra years you work are years your nest egg doesn't have to support you, which, all else equal, means you should be able to draw more from savings stash each year without increasing the risk of running through your savings too soon.\n\nAs effective as working longer can be, however, don't count on staying on the job. The Employee Benefit Research Institute has consistently found that nearly half of workers retire sooner than they expected, often because of health issues, layoffs or because they have to care for a spouse or other family member. So by all means plan on working an extra year or two or three to enhance your retirement security. But don't slack off on saving now because you think you'll be able to compensate by extending your career.\n\n3. Be flexible and resourceful\n\nDepending on how far behind you've fallen in your retirement planning efforts, you may not realistically be able to save enough or put in enough extra years in your job to make up for lost time. Which means you need to be open to other ways to enhance your retirement security.\n\nOne possibility is to look for sources of extra income aside from Social Security and your savings. If you're a homeowner, for example, you may be able to tap the equity in your home for extra retirement spending cash by downsizing to a smaller, less expensive home in your area or by staying in your current digs and taking out a reverse mortgage. You can explore both options by checking out this guide from the Boston College Center for Retirement Research.\n\nRelated: Is there a low-risk way to avoid running out of money in retirement?\n\nYou may also be able to generate additional income to supplement Social Security and draws from your nest egg by finding part-time work (assuming you're healthy enough to hold down a job and can find work you consider acceptable). You can get an idea of what sort of job opportunities are available to older workers and retirees by going to such sites as RetiredBrains and RetirementJobs.com.\n\nThen there are more, shall we say, radical moves you might consider. For example, you may effectively be able to stretch your retirement income by relocating to an area with lower living costs. To compare expenses in various cities, you can check out the Cost of Living section at Sperling's Best Places site and NerdWallet's Cost of Living Calculator. For that matter, if you relocate and downsize at the same time, you may be able to reduce your living expenditures while also coming away with an extra chunk of investable cash that can serve as a supplement to your nest egg.\n\nBottom line: I'm not saying it will be easy or that you can put yourself in the same position for retirement you would have been in had you saved throughout your career. But if you combine several of the steps I've outlined here — and keep an eye out for even more ways to generate more post-career income or lower your future expenses — you can still improve your chances of achieving a secure retirement.", "name": "3 ways to recover from a late start on retirement planning", "description": "Even if you have nothing in your 50s, you still have enough time to significantly improve your retirement prospects, if you're willing to start taking serious steps now.", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/21/retirement/late-start-on-retirement-planning/index.html", "id": "ca20b8c34ff5260b88861880eda0407719bf7eb1", "keywords": ["savings", "able", "recover", "saving", "late", "egg", "ways", "start", "extra", "planning", "social", "nest", "retirement", "security", "save"], "timestamp": "2018-06-21T00:00:00"}

His pupils are tiny, and his breathing is labored.\n\nHow would they treat him?\n\nThe newly hired nurses and nurse assistants voiced mixed opinions. Then the supervisor overseeing the training session in a Maryland county walloped by the opioid epidemic made a suggestion: The overdose reversal drug Narcan.\n\n“What do we have to lose?\" Maureen Neall asked.\n\nNearly 50,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses last year – more than from car accidents. Now schools across the nation are preparing for what some believe is inevitable: Overdoses at schools.\n\nHigh schools, middle schools and even some elementary schools are stocking nurse's offices with naloxone or Narcan, the brand name for the nasal spray version of the injectable drug. Some have been required by new state laws to keep the drug on hand. Others are taking advantage of a private drug company's offer of two free kits to any high school that asks.\n\nAdvocates liken the effort to having the lifesaving allergy drug EpiPen or portable defibrillators used for cardiac arrest.\n\n'Whatever is going on in our county will be in our schools'\n\nBut critics question the need. Some say the effort would be better directed toward communities and institutions that see more overdoses.\n\n“I have not seen a single data point that an overdose happened at a school,” said Eliza Wheeler, an overdose response strategist with the Harm Reduction Coalition in Oakland, California. “The problem here is how they came up with that – investing millions of dollars into a problem with no data to know whether it is even happening?”\n\nNo federal agency tracks overdoses at schools, but it’s clear that teens and young adults in big cities and small towns alike are using and dying from heroin and, increasingly, the more powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nOverdose deaths among people aged 15 to 24 jumped nearly 33 percent from 2015 to 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Preliminary numbers from 2017 show that total overdose deaths surged still higher, but do not include deaths by age groups.\n\nNurses who work with students daily say it's only a matter of time before a community's ills spill over to its schools.\n\nKaren Siska-Creel, director of school nursing at the Anne Arundel health department, pushed to get naloxone in schools because overdose deaths in the county near Baltimore were skyrocketing.\n\n“I knew what was going on in the nation and our state,” she said. “I figured whatever is going on in our county will be in our schools.”\n\nKaren Siska-Creel, the director of nursing for the Anne Arundel County, Maryland, school health services, has pushed to expand access to the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone. (Photo: for USA TODAY)\n\nIn 2015, Siska-Creel created the county’s overdose prevention training initiative, the first school program certified by the State of Maryland. She secured $12,500 in public funds to buy two doses of Narcan for each of the county’s 125 schools, and she trained school nurses and support staff on how to administer the drug.\n\nTen days after the program launched in early 2016, Siska-Creel said, a teenage student appeared in a high school health center“acting funny.” The unidentified girl began to fade; within minutes she was not responding to questions.\n\nThe school nurse administered two doses of naloxone. The student recovered, Siska-Creel said, and was transported to a hospital for followup care.\n\nAnne Arundel schools have used naloxone three more times on students, one a high-school student who was nodding off in class last year.\n\nWhat started with one determined nurse in one county has become a statewide requirement. The Start Talking Maryland Act, passed by the Maryland General Assembly last year, requires all public schools to carry naloxone and to teach students about the dangers of heroin and other opioids.\n\nThe state appropriated $3 million to pay for naloxone, opioid education and other requirements. Now counties must report the number of times that naloxone has been administered at schools. Anne Arundel is the only school district that has used the antidote since 2017, a state education official said.\n\nMore: To save lives, the surgeon general says get the opioid antidote naloxone. Here's what to do.\n\nMore: Surgeon General's advisory: You can stop an overdose death by carrying this simple kit\n\nNew Jersey passed legislation this year that requires all high schools – public, private and charter – to stock naloxone. It authorizes school nurses to administer up to three doses of naloxone to a student, staff member or visitor without fear of prosecution.\n\n\"Our first goal was to stop these deaths,\" said Assemblyman Vincent Mazzeo, who sponsored the legislation. \"This epidemic is hitting all forms of life here. We already have defibrillators. We think this is a proactive approach.\"\n\nBut across the Hudson River, schools in New York City are taking a different approach.\n\nWith no known overdoses at school during regular school hours since 2005, city education officials say they do not see the need to stock the antidote at every school. City schools offer substance abuse education and intervention services as well as mental health for students and their families.\n\nA special education teacher was found dead in a Bronx school bathroom last November with a syringe and a small baggie containing drug residue.\n\nMedical examiners concluded that Matthew Azimi overdosed on fentanyl. One man was accused of selling the lethal drug to Azimi and another was charged with selling heroin and fentanyl near the school. But Azimi is believed to have died after school hours.\n\nElsewhere in New York State, suburban and rural districts are keeping the drug on hand.\n\n\n\nThe state has committed more than $300 million to programs to fight the opioid epidemic. More than 100 school districts have enrolled in overdose prevention programs and trained more than 11,000 non-medical school personnel on how to recognize an overdose and administer naloxone.\n\nStudent overdoses have been rare in New York, but there are at least two known cases.\n\nStudents received naloxone at high schools in Suffolk County and Ulster County in 2017, according to state health officials. They did not have information about how those two students fared after getting the antidote.\n\nRhode Island, viewed as one of the most aggressive states in confronting the opioid epidemic, requires all public middle, junior and high schools to carry naloxone. No Rhode Island school has used the antidote on a student overdose, a health department spokesman said.\n\nAt least 10 states have passed legislation about naloxone in schools. Some states such as Maryland, New Jersey and Rhode Island require schools to stock the antidote. More often, states allow a local school board or superintendent to decide.\n\n\"It's a community decision,\" said Donna Mazyck, executive director of the National Association of School Nurses.\n\nThe association adopted the position three years ago that schools and school nurses should make naloxone available to respond to overdoses.\n\nAdapt Pharma, the company that markets Narcan, gave the association a $25,000 grant in 2016. The nurses spent the money to create a \"brand agnostic\" training kit for opioid emergencies that schools can download from its website.\n\nThe association has also offered training or supplies for CPR, epinephrine injectors and albuterol inhalers.\n\n\"Health departments have grappled with this across the nation,\" Mazyck said. \"Schools just happen to be one more place in the community.\"\n\n'Schools are the cornerstone of every community'\n\nWhile many states are ponying up taxpayer funds to buy naloxone, Adapt Pharma has offered high schools two starter kits of Narcan free of charge.\n\nThe Irish company with U.S. headquarters outside Philadelphia launched the program through the Clinton Foundation in April 2016, spokesman Thom Duddy said. It has since donated or sold 3,436 kits to 1,167 schools nationwide.\n\nThe states that have received the most free kits are Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nA Narcan kit that contains two doses. The drug expires after two years. Most states have passed standing orders that allow pharmacies to sell Narcan and other naloxone products without a prescription. Narcan retails for $130 to $150, according to the prescription drug website GoodRx.\n\nAdapt Pharma charges a discounted group purchase price of $75 per kit to entities such as emergency medical crews, government agencies, community organizations and schools not covered by the program's giveaway program.\n\nThe company does not track whether its donated kits are used, Duddy said, in part to avoid the possibility of violating federal patient-confidentiality laws. So it does not know whether a donated kit has ever saved a student.\n\nCompany officials see the kits as part of a larger educational offering, a talking point that can help reduce the stigma of addiction and instruct students about the slippery slope from common pain medication such as Vicodin and Percocet to opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nAdapt also sees the free kits as another potential safeguard for the larger community. The kits can be available should an adult overdose at a high school football game, a school play or a school-based polling place.\n\n\"We firmly believe schools are the cornerstone of every community in the United States,\" said Mike Kelly, president of Adapt Pharma's U.S. operations.\n\nCritics: Higher-priority groups should get naloxone first\n\nCritics say scarce resources should be steered toward groups that face greater risk of overdose.\n\nCorey Davis, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program,cited examples such as paroled inmates with histories of drug abuse or opioid-dependent people in abstinence-based treatment programs.\n\n“I can’t imagine Adapt is claiming this is the best use of resources,” Davis said.\n\nWheeler, of the Harm Reduction Coalition, said the key to reversing overdoses is giving naloxone directly to drug users.\n\n\"People use drugs with other people who use drugs – or alone,\" Wheeler said. \"They are the ones witnessing overdoses.\"\n\nOther higher-priority groups might include parents of people who are addicted, or public places such as restaurants, libraries or public restrooms.\n\nWheeler said it's difficult for an organization like hers to pay for enough naloxone to cover drug users on the street or in at-risk communities. Some harm-reduction organizations have resorted to bake sales to raise money.\n\n\"We often joke: 'At least we know where all the naloxone is being kept,'\" Wheeler said. \"It's in the schools.\"\n\n'He had life in his eyes'\n\nOthers defend the idea of naloxone in schools, even if the drug is not frequently used.\n\nToni Torsch, of Baltimore County, Maryland, has advocated for wider distribution of naloxone, compassionate laws and public investment in fighting the opioid crisis since her 24-year-oldson died from an overdose in 2010.\n\nDaniel Carl Torsch started using OxyContin at 17. He eventually turned to cheaper heroin in what became a seven-year battle that included four stays at inpatient treatment centers.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2010, Torsch thought her son was in a good place. He had recently completed a long-term rehab stint in Florida, and seemed healthy and happy.\n\n\"He had life in his eyes,\" Torsch said. \"I had my boy back.\"\n\nBut as she prepared to leave their home that day, she knocked on his bedroom door. There was no answer.\n\nShe nudged the door open. He lay on a bed. No signs of life.\n\nShe did not know about naloxone when her son died. After she learned about the drug from a documentary, she advocated for its wider use. Now she says that many others can be spared if they get the antidote in time, or learn about the dangers of abuse before taking their first pill or injection.\n\n\"I found out later who he was getting his pills from – normal families. Right there in school,\" Torsch said.\n\nIn Anne Arundel County, Siska-Creel said she has heard many similar stories of mothers and fathers who have lost children.\n\nShe also hears from skeptics about stocking naloxone in schools.\n\n\"People came to me who said, 'You will never use it. It's a waste of money. It's going to affect our property values.'\" she said.\n\n\"You know what? I am not going to wait for a child to die. I am not willing to wait for that to happen.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2CHfplC", "name": "Naloxone can reverse opioid overdoses, but does the drug belong in elementary schools?", "description": "Schools are stocking the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, but critics question whether it's a good use of the drug", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/09/11/schools-fighting-opioid-epidemic-overdose-reversal-drug-naloxone-narcan/1210383002/", "id": "2bb9904f7176e1b5506c96495cf38e3c07facc42", "keywords": ["opioid", "does", "state", "naloxone", "belong", "school", "states", "overdoses", "drug", "county", "schools", "reverse", "overdose", "elementary"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

(Photo: Grace Beahm Alford, The Post And Courier, via AP)\n\nFerocious Hurricane Florence barrelled toward the U.S. East Coast on Tuesday, a massive storm threatening record rains and historic flooding as more than 1 million people flee the anticipated devastation.\n\nThe first rain bands could reach the Carolinas and Virginia on Wednesday, forecasters said. Hurricane-force winds could reach the mainland Thursday.\n\n“This storm is not going to be a glancing blow,\" FEMA Associate Administrator for Response and Recovery Jeff Byard said Tuesday. \"This storm is going to be a direct hit.\"\n\nAn ominous 11 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center reported that Florence was driving maximum sustained winds of almost 130 mph, a Category 4 storm out of a possible Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.\n\n\"Some strengthening is expected during the next day or so, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday night,\" the hurricane center's update said.\n\nA \"major\" hurricane is one with sustained winds of more than 110 mph.

Florence was forecast to roll across the southwestern Atlantic between Bermuda and the Bahamas through Wednesday before approaching the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina on Thursday or Friday.\n\nFlorence is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 15 to 20 inches in some areas and possibly 30 inches in isolated locations along the storm's track, the hurricane center said.\n\nIf Florence stalls, some areas could see record storm rainfalls. Record flooding could reach into Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it hits as a Category 3 or Category 4 storm, it's going to be a huge storm with major flooding, major storm surge,\" said AccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster Dan Kottlowski. \"Major hurricanes cause major damage.\"\n\nMore: More than 1 million to flee as Hurricane Florence rips toward East Coast\n\nTracker: Follow Hurricane Florence as storm barrels toward East Coast\n\nHurricane storm-surge watches were issued from Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to the North Carolina-Virginia border.\n\nIn South Carolina alone, hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists are expected to flee from coastal areas, Gov.

No life is worth taking a risk.\"\n\nAt a BP gas station in North Myrtle Beach, Sandra Dews said she was staying in her neighborhood because she was scared she would not be able to get back in after the storm. Dews is a survivor of Hurricane Matthew, which made landfall in the state two years ago as a Category 1 storm.\n\n“I rode out Matthew,” she said. “It will be a little worse.”\n\nIn North Carolina, officials in coastal Dare County ordered everyone to leave Hatteras Island on Monday. Residents and visitors in popular tourist spots such as Duck and Corolla faced a Tuesday deadline. The exodus slowed to a crawl in some areas amid heavy traffic and roads awash with early storm surge.\n\nConcerns about the monster storm extended into Virginia. Gov. Ralph Northam ordered a mandatory evacuation to begin Tuesday for 245,000 people in parts of the Hampton Roads area and the eastern shore.\n\nLate Sunday and early Monday, the hurricane roared from a Category 1 (90 mph) to a Category 4 (130 mph) in just 13 hours, an extremely quick intensification, Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach said. That's the most rapid hurricane intensification since Hurricane Humberto in 2007, he said.\n\nThe hurricane center's description of a Category 4 hurricane begins with \"catastrophic damage will occur.\" The center warns that such storms will snap or uproot most trees and down power poles. Power can be out in some areas for weeks or months.\n\nIn addition to Florence, Tropical Storm Isaac and Hurricane Helene are also spinning far out in the Atlantic Ocean. While Helene is forecast to slide out to sea, Isaac should barrel into the Caribbean by Friday.\n\nYet another tropical system is also gathering strength in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and could threaten Texas later in the week.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Olivia is forecast to hit Hawaii on Wednesday, where tropical storm warnings are in effect.\n\nContributing: Ledyard King\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2x6x7bQ", "name": "Ferocious Hurricane Florence: Category 4 storm expected to strengthen as 1 million flee", "description": "Already ferocious Hurricane Florence grew stronger Tuesday as it marched toward the U.S. East Coast.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/09/11/hurricane-florence-category-5-north-carolina-south-carolina/1264377002/", "id": "741315faff7b473305f5affbd831924ccc127860", "keywords": ["carolina", "hurricane", "flee", "storm", "ferocious", "north", "category", "expected", "florence", "areas", "tropical", "major", "mph", "strengthen", "million"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

Every weekend, promoters would throw Slavic night bashes at venues like Ozio on M Street and Eden on Farragut Square. Euro-pop beats pounded and vodka shots flowed. In 2013, Mari Vanna, a three-story restaurant and nightclub littered with Soviet-era kitsch, opened in DuPont Circle and became the Russian diaspora’s de facto party house. Its “KGB Karaoke” nights on Wednesdays raged into the morning hours. Top Russian acts like Ivanushki International would swing through town to play gigs, and Washington Capitals stars Alexander Ovechkin and Alexander Semin would sometimes join in the revelry with students and summer workers from all over the former Soviet Union.\n\n“Before, I would call an event and say, ‘Hey we’re going to have Ukrainian Independence Day,’ and everybody would come,” Andrey Bessarabov, better known as DJ Bezza, a Soviet-born IT worker who moonlights for Troika Party, a promoter of Eastern European club nights in the area. “It didn’t matter Ukrainian, Russian. Nobody differentiated.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThen Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea, and the headlines were filled with talk of sanctions. The party scene began to fracture along political lines. The Ukrainians went their own way. Suddenly parties marking Defender of the Fatherland Day seemed in poor taste given their Russian nationalist overtones. “A lot of people felt negative about it, so I kind of stopped organizing them,” Bessarabov confided over cake on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna.\n\nBut nothing prepared the young Russians of Washington for the wintry blast of social isolation and suspicion that followed the arrest this July of an attractive young Russian apparatchik. When Maria Butina, 29, was charged with acting as an unregistered Kremlin agent from her perch as a grad student at American University, it seemed to confirm Washington’s worst suspicions about them.\n\nNow, more so than ever, the capital’s young Russiantonians find themselves living in a battlefield of the new Cold War.\n\nTheir Tinder dates keep asking them if they’re spies. Their landlords are interrogating them. Their résumés are getting tossed in the trash, and when they do get the job, their boss might warn them not to mention their nationality to people at the office. If that sounds bad, many of them—especially opposition figures and gay men in exile—are regarded with more suspicion by their own government back home than by their new neighbors here.\n\nTo be young and Russian in Washington is, often, to live in the gray ambiguities of a John le Carré Cold War spy novel. You’re pretty sure those questions about being a spy are innocent flirtations, and your boss might be joking when he asks you to keep your birthplace to yourself, but it is not totally clear. Then there’s the too-good-to-be true job offer on LinkedIn: Have you lucked out, or are you being recruited for something else?\n\nWhen friends with ties to official Washington bail on plans to hang out, a calendar conflict can take on more sinister overtones. “Are they really busy? Who knows?” mused Maria Snegovaya, a young academic from St. Petersburg who recently entered the fog of Russian expat life in D.C. “You’re not hired for that job. Why is that?”\n\n\n\n***\n\nSnegovaya has good reason to wonder.\n\nFederal law forbids employers from discriminating against job-seekers based on their citizenship or national origin, but a Washington cybersecurity executive said private firms that do sensitive work for the U.S. government avoid hiring applicants from countries like Russia, China and Iran, describing the practice as a “very well-enforced informal policy.\"\n\nThe executive receives and discards so many résumés from Russian and Chinese job-seekers that he has joked with colleagues he should give them all summer internships and sequester them in a separate room so someone from the government posing as an “internship coordinator” can secretly monitor them.\n\nJokes aside, the practice also has drawbacks for the firms that practice it. “What sucks is D.C. is a very tough place to recruit engineers in,” the executive said. “And the engineers coming out of Russia and China are supertalented.” Frustrated Russian job-seekers might have better luck out West, where firms doing sensitive work tend to be more lax in their hiring, the executive said. “We are much more attuned to it than folks in Silicon Valley are.”\n\nEven young Americans in Washington who fraternize too much with Russians can face career consequences. One think-tanker with a security clearance said he recently came to trust an American underling less because the underling participates in too many Russian-sponsored cultural exchanges for his liking.\n\nAnd for Russians who do get the job, office life in Washington can be awkward. Dmitry Sivaev, an urban development specialist at the World Bank, recalled his annoyance when a former boss told him not to mention to colleagues that he was Russian. Sivaev was so taken aback he could not tell whether his boss was being serious.\n\n“He is a guy who could have been joking about it,” he said, “but even joking felt very uncomfortable.”\n\nThose uncomfortable interactions can follow Russiantonians home. One Russian journalist in\n\nWashington whose first name is Natalia often goes by Natasha. Natalia, who asked that only her first name be used, told me she was perturbed when her landlady, who perhaps had been watching too much “Rocky & Bullwinkle,” recently began to question her about using the nickname, as if it were some sort of spy alias. The landlady seemed satisfied when Natalia showed her a Wikipedia article explaining that “Natasha” is a standard diminutive for Natalia.\n\n\n\n***\n\nLate on a recent Monday night, a lanky man smoking a cigarette on the sidewalk outside Blagden Alley in Shaw, loudly complained about his recent experience dating a Russian woman. His ex-girlfriend is brilliant, he explained to me, after I overheard him spilling his sorrows. She works for an international nongovernmental organization and excels at math, but she also cheated on him. And she becomes erratic when drinking. He leaned forward to show me what he said was a scar on his forehead from when she had beaned him with a full glass of vodka, though I couldn’t make it out in the light of a streetlamp.\n\nThat kind of domestic combat appears to be an isolated incident. Mostly, men in Washington seem to be intrigued by Russian women, though they do keep asking if they’re spies. “When you go on dates people joke about it a lot,” said Alina, a petite 21-year-old Muscovite who recently graduated from Duke, moved to Washington this summer and declined to provide her last name during a brief interview at Mari Vanna.\n\nThe questions from men about being a spy are “Mostly for flirting,” said one thirty-something Russian woman on the D.C. dating scene. “At least I treat it this way.”\n\nOf course, the prospect of Russian agents using sex as a weapon of statecraft is a real one. Former counterintelligence officials say Russians are particularly fond of the honey trap, the use of attractive young people, usually women, to compromise or gain influence over intelligence targets, usually older men. Prosecutors allege that Butina, for example, used a romantic relationship with Paul Erickson, a 56-year-old Republican operative, to further her aims as she sought access to conservative political networks such as the National Rifle Association and the annual CPAC conference (Butina’s lawyer claims the two were genuinely in love).\n\nNot every use of the honey trap fits that stereotype. One former top counterintelligence official described his consternation at the recklessness of State Department officials of both sexes during the Obama years who indulged in sexual favors from in-room masseurs during their stays at the Moscow Ritz, the same hotel made infamous by the Steele dossier’s unsubstantiated allegations about Donald Trump’s behavior in the presidential suite.\n\nThe 30-something Russian woman, who has earned the Kremlin’s ire for her writing in praise of economic sanctions, said she is on guard for a certain kind of approach. “I’m not worried of young Russians,” she said. “I’m worried of young, blue-eyed, model-looking guys.”\n\nThe age-old tactic has been given a new spin by dating apps, which allow would-be spies to make far more passes and do so at a safe distance, posing new challenges for U.S. counterintelligence—as well as for single Russians just trying to get a date.\n\n“We can’t go to Tinder and say, ‘Give us a list of everyone with a Russian surname,’” said Frank Montoya Jr., a former FBI special agent and former director of the Office of the National Counterintelligence Directorate.\n\nInstead, people with access to sensitive information are trained to be wary when engaging with young Russians (as well as young Chinese nationals, or even people who do not appear to be foreign at all) on dating apps and social media.\n\n“If she has a Russian last name, that doesn’t mean don’t engage, especially if you’re really attracted to her,” Montoya advises. Instead, deep state daters should be on the lookout for red flags once they swipe right. “Are they asking specific questions about what you do? Do they persist in those questions? And when are they asking you about those things? Is it after a drink? After a lot of drinks? Is it pillow talk?\"\n\nMontoya advises a bit of common sense. “If that person is really interested in you, they're going to ask about your family, they’re going to ask about your hobbies, they’re going to ask you about where you want to go for drinks tomorrow night,” he said. “They’re not going to ask you what you do in that windowless room in the belly of the beast in Langley.”\n\nWhen he was working in sensitive government posts, Montoya even had to warn his three young sons that they could be targeted online by women seeking access to their father. LinkedIn may be worse than dating apps, added Montoya, who regularly received unsolicited business propositions from Russian and Chinese women on the networking site.\n\n“Nick,” a 20-something Russian-born U.S. citizen who holds a security clearance and works as a consultant for a major defense contractor described being the target of suspected phishing attempts on both platforms. The first was the prospective offer of a cushy job in private equity, made via LinkedIn. Nick, who spoke on the condition that his real name not be used, was immediately wary because private equity firms rarely recruit consultants. When the man who initiated the discussions passed Nick on to an associate with a generic Outlook.com address, Nick bailed, figuring a legitimate offer would come from a business’ email domain.\n\nLast year, Nick who came to the U.S. as an adolescent, found his suspicions aroused again when he engaged in an extended flirtation on Tinder with a young woman he came to believe was targeting him for intelligence-gathering purposes. “I don’t know if I was targeted specifically or whether I became an asset of potential interest as we started getting to know each other,” he said.\n\n“One thing that I noticed was very, very quick replies, something that is very unusual on Tinder,” he recalled. “The questions would be very, very, very, very sort of like pointed.”\n\nNick kept his responses vague, though he did mention a love for drinking tea, and eventually he worked up the nerve to ask her out. But when she declined the invitation, her reason was a little too on the nose.\n\n“She said she was actually a tea sommelier and that she had an event this weekend,” he recalled. “I was like, ‘Wow that's so unusual. This is the nicest excuse you could have given me, but I also think it happens to not be true.’” Nick blocked her two days later.\n\nBesides going online, the counterintelligence threat posed by Russians in Washington is evolving in other ways.\n\nAccording to Montoya, the Russians have learned from watching the Chinese, who rely more heavily on “non-professional collection”—drawing intelligence from all sorts of nationals with access to sensitive information, rather than primarily relying on professional operatives. The Chinese model is often called “a thousand grains of sand.”\n\nAs evidenced by Butina—who schmoozed relentlessly, actively sought publicity and questioned candidate Trump at a campaign event while allegedly coordinating her activities with a Russian government official—young Kremlin agents in the U.S. are also becoming more brazen.\n\n“They don’t think there are any boundaries because of what the Russians did to us in 2016,” said Montoya, explaining that successful exploits in the U.S. can help young Russians break into their country’s elite at a time when average citizens are suffering from economic stagnation. “That's the risk-reward of what these kids are trying to do. They’re enterprising and they do it because they think the payoffs will be huge.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russians here are also often targets for recruitment by U.S. intelligence services. Sivaev, at the World Bank, mentioned a Russian friend who believed she was being groomed for recruitment by the U.S. government. Through Sivaev, she declined to speak to me.\n\nWhile Russians of all ages can be potential assets, men between the ages of 45 and 55 are the riper targets than their younger comrades for U.S. government recruitment, according to Mike Rochford, a retired FBI special agent who served as espionage section chief in the bureau’s counterintelligence division. “We notice that people of that age, especially in Russia, tended to have a more realistic point of view,” he said. “Marriages go bad, ambitions go bad, they don’t get promotions. Some people have bad situations with their superiors. Some people lose money in the stock market. Their mom and dad die.”\n\nWashington’s numerous campuses are also sites of counterintelligence concern, both because university study is a common cover for foreign agents and because of the sensitive research conducted on them. Butina was enrolled as a graduate student at American University while allegedly pushing the Kremlin’s agenda here.\n\n“If there's someone coming over here from Russia, and they’re getting access to universities,” warned Rochford, “Then they should be looked at very, very hard, because they have conflicted loyalties.”\n\nCounterintelligence officials regularly meet with university officials all over the country to warn them of just that, with mixed results. Many administrators are loath to turn away bright students or researchers on account of vague warnings about national security. One former top counterintelligence official said that the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins, which perform a lot of classified military research, take such concerns more seriously than the universities in the District.\n\nLife on campus as a Russian is more or less normal, reports Alexander Naumov, a sophomore pursuing international relations and Russian studies at George Mason University in Northern Virginia.\n\nNaumov, a tall 19-year-old with frosted tips, came to the U.S. from a small Russian town as a child. A dual citizen who wants to dedicate his career to improving U.S.-Russia relations, Naumov said he has not experienced discrimination, though friends have joked that it will be difficult for him to get a security clearance. He also told of a Russian classmate who returned to his dorm room last year to find someone had tried to set fire to his Russian flag, which had burn marks on it.\n\nNaumov and his mother have recently reconnected with their Russian heritage through an annual march from the White House to the Mall organized to commemorate Soviet World War II veterans.\n\n“It's been feeling like I have two families and I really want to do everything I can to bring them together,” he said, and to “decrease the chance of miscalculation, which could lead to grave consequences.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nI first encountered Naumov at an August gathering at the Russian Embassy commemorating the World War II Battle of Kursk, a 1943 Soviet victory over Germany that helped turn the tide on the Eastern Front.\n\nIn an ornate second-floor ballroom, Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov toasted the bravery of the Soviet soldiers with vodka and repeatedly hammered home the theme that the Russian government would not tolerate any attempts to desecrate their memory (a reference to the same historical reevaluations that forced DJ Bezza to cancel his Defender of the Fatherland Day raves).\n\nIt was no karaoke night at Mari Vanna, where “KGB” has been dropped from the event name but a dedicated clutch of loyalists continues to gather each Wednesday to suck down Baltika beers and belt out Russian pop songs among antique samovars, reading the lyrics off screens that otherwise play endless loops of the Soviet cartoon “Nu, Pogodi!” But in addition to Naumov and a number of well-groomed embassy staffers, a handful of other young Russians nibbled on finger food and browsed an exhibition about the battle. The young guests, by-and-large more sympathetic to the Kremlin than critical of it, stood around a table expressing frustration that of late, all Washingtonians want to talk to them about is politics, and their opinions of Putin, a topic they would just as soon avoid.\n\nWhile opposition supporters were largely game to speak for this article, those more sympathetic to the Kremlin—or tied to Butina—were not. A spokesman for the Russian Embassy did not respond to an email seeking guidance on the city’s young Russians, nor did the Center for the National Interest, a pro-Kremlin D.C. think tank with ties to Butina. Elena Branson, the New York-based chair of the Kremlin-aligned Coordinating Council of Organizations of Russian Compatriots of the U.S.A., also did not respond to an email seeking guidance on young Russians in Washington who support Putin.\n\nA lawyer for Butina suggested speaking to Anton Fedyashin, the director of the school’s Carmel Institute of Russian Culture & History, in which Butina was active. Neither Fedyashin nor the press office at American University responded to inquiries. Susan Carmel, a local philanthropist who funds the center and is a friend of former Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, said through a spokeswoman that she was unavailable for an interview.\n\nRobert Ainsley, who oversees an exchange program for young opera singers between Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre and the Washington National Opera, did take my call. He said the program, which Carmel funds, has been an unmitigated success. “At least on an artistic and a cultural level there is no problem between these nations,” he said, though he noted that diplomatic tensions have made it more difficult to secure visas for Russian singers to come here.\n\n\n\n***\n\nOf course, life for young Russiantonians is not an unending stream of side-eye glances and faux glasnost. The standard of living here is far better than in Russia, where the gross domestic product per capita is about $9,000. And for a sizable number of young Russians who came to Washington fleeing persecution, the city is a haven.\n\nOleg Tomilin, a gay man from the city of Voronezh in southwestern Russia came to Washington in 2014 seeking political asylum. He is middle-aged but said he knows 40 or 50 gay Russian men in the area, mostly in their 20s and 30s, who are doing the same. One of them is 29-year-old Andrew Nasonov, who previously worked in Voronezh as a journalist and activist against anti-LGBT laws. Before he fled to Washington, he was accosted there by Russian police and accused of participating in a conspiracy to murder someone in Moscow.\n\nWhen he first arrived here four years ago, a gay couple provided Nasonov and his now-husband with free housing for a year in Columbia Heights and then Silver Spring, Maryland. Another gay couple provided them with free housing for another year in Falls Church, Virginia. When Nasonov, who has taken a break from activism and turned instead to making art, launched a GoFundMe to pay rent on a studio near the Takoma Metro station, Washingtonians he had never met put up the money for it.\n\nNasonov has no intentions of leaving the city. “For me to go back to Russia, it's like equal to death,” he said. “I’m afraid of it.”\n\nThat’s what Karina Orlova, 32, feared when she fled Moscow for Washington three years ago. An opposition journalist, she made statements about the January 2015 Charlie Hebdo massacre and images of the prophet Muhammad that earned the ire of Chechen Muslims. Orlova was used to hearing from cranks, but after Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman who rules Chechnya as Putin’s vassal, spoke out to condemn images of Muhammad, she began receiving credible death threats from Chechens on Facebook.\n\nIn February 2015, opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was murdered outside the Kremlin, apparently by Chechens tied to Kadyrov, and Orlova decided to move to Washington. Here, she writes for Echo of Moscow, an opposition radio station, and for subscribers to her channel on the Russian messaging app Telegram, about American culture and politics.\n\nWhen she divulges her occupation to people in Washington, they often respond with a knowing smile. “When you tell people you’re a Russian journalist, you have to explain you’re not propaganda,” she said.\n\nOverall, she is a fan of her new home.\n\nShe was heartened to find a popular anti-Putin slogan scrawled in Cyrillic on a bathroom wall at Solly’s, a dive bar on U Street, and has even contributed some graffiti of her own to the D.C. streetscape. Shortly after arriving here, she came across posters advertising RT, the Kremlin-backed media outlet, on H Street—a hip section of Northeast Washington—and vandalized them with a marker, writing “Putin’s motherfuckers” and “stop war in Ukraine.”\n\nThat attitude does not play well back home.\n\nAfter volunteering with So Others Might Eat, a D.C.-based charity for the poor, she wrote a post saying the homeless in Washington eat better than patients in Russian hospitals, where the food is notoriously lousy, provoking fierce criticism in Russia.\n\nIn Washington, though, she feels welcome. “Americans are really nice and polite people,” she said. “They’re better than Russians actually.” Just a little more on edge these days.\n\nBen Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.", "name": "Tinder Woes, Suspicious Landlords and Snarky Bosses: Young and Russian in D.C.", "description": "Washington’s young émigré crowd is beginning to feel like they’re living in a spy novel.

Brittany: It's scary, and you're allowed to be scared. Lorenzo: It's frightening, especially when you don't know anything about it. Wendy: A lot of people just don't know even where to start. One thing I always recommend, which is what helped me, is finding a good doctor because psoriasis is not a one-size-fits-all disease. Dr. Goldman: Because it is a chronic condition, I think it is important to form a partnership with your dermatologist so to optimize therapy. Dr. Jaber: There are so many wonderful treatments for psoriasis and it's just as important for each patient to determine what the best treatment is for them. Wendy: A topical might work for some people, whereas it might not work for other people, like it didn't work for me. Dr. Jaber: She might choose an oral medication or injectable medication, but it really depends on each patient. Wendy: Currently I'm using a biologic treatment, which has cleared my skin. Dr. Goldman: I'm not necessarily their counselor or their internist, but I'm going to mention that a healthy lifestyle can improve psoriasis. Go out there, be physically active. I think a little sunlight helps people. Brittany: You know, to eat better, to treat your body better. Dr. Goldman: Several patients have lost weight and their psoriasis got better. Brittany: Try meditation, try yoga, try something. Lorenzo: I wrote a journal. I know what I'm eating, I know what I'm feeling, I know what the weather is, did it flare up here, did it flare up there. You actually can live your life around this chronic disease. Dr. Strachan: Having psoriasis can be stressful, and stress can cause psoriasis, so managing your stress is important. Brittany: There's going to be bad moments, and you're allowed to have bad or sad days. Have the sad day, and that's it, the next day you have to get up and start your life over again. Lorenzo: Talk to people, help people. Wendy: I do actually go to a therapist and that seems to help me a lot. Brittany: Find a community or a friend or somebody that has psoriasis. Dr. Jaber: Go on the National Psoriasis Foundation website, it's a great resource for patients. Brittany: We're all there for each other, we're a family. Wendy: Don't give up. Don't just live with the disease because you can get help and you can live a normal everyday life. There are treatment options out there, there is support groups out there. Lorenzo: Own this disease, I know that sounds funny. You really can maneuver your life around it. It's not going to ruin me, it's not an end all at all. It's manageable, you can live with it, you can own it.\n\nPeople with psoriasis are also prone to developing some other illnesses, which are risks themselves for heart disease, such as:\n\nObesity\n\nType 2 diabetes\n\nHypertension (high blood pressure)\n\nMetabolic syndrome\n\nWhat causes the complications to the heart?\n\nLong-term inflammation in your arteries leads to damage in the arterial walls. This can lead to atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. When there is damage along your arterial wall, substances in your blood, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), can hook on to the wall and become stuck, narrowing the blood vessel. As it becomes harder for your blood to flow past the obstruction, your heart has to work harder, leading to heart disease. Fatty deposits stuck to the wall could also break off and travel through your blood stream to your heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke. Additionally, chronic smoldering inflammation anywhere in the body leads to elevated levels of chemical mediators that are directly related to atherosclerotic heart disease.\n\nResearchers have also found other problems that are unique to people with psoriasis and may increase their heart disease risk:\n\nPeople with psoriasis have thicker, denser LDL that can clog up more easily\n\nThey don’t have as much “good” cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which works against LDL\n\nThey may take medications, such as acitretin (Soriatane), that can increase LDL and decrease HDL\n\nCombined with the higher risk people with psoriasis have for obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or metabolic syndrome, all patients with psoriasis need to take steps to prevent heart complications.\n\nHow can heart problems caused by psoriasis be prevented?\n\nYou can help reduce your risk of heart disease, a heart attack, or stroke caused by psoriasis by managing your illness as well as possible, and by living a healthy lifestyle. Along with your doctor’s advice, here are some ways you can help yourself:\n\nFollow your psoriasis treatment plan : Take your medications as prescribed by your doctor to treat your psoriasis. If you have any concerns about the drugs, speak with your doctor or pharmacist. Don’t stop treatment without discussing it first with your doctor.\n\nEat a heart-healthy diet : Eating a heart-healthy diet not only helps reduce your risk of developing heart disease, it also helps reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and other illnesses that can be related to lifestyle. If your doctor has advised you to lose weight and you don’t know where to start, ask to meet with a dietitian, who will be able to help you develop new eating patterns.\n\nExercise : Speak with your doctor about starting an exercise plan if you don’t exercise already. For some people, regular exercise is a daily walk; for others, it’s participating in team sports. Find an activity that will keep you active and that you’ enjoy, so you’ll stick to it.\n\nReduce your stress levels : This may be easier said than done, but stress can increase the risk of heart disease, so reducing stress is important. Being physically active can be one type of stress reliever, as can participating in activities such as yoga, meditation and mindfulness. Therapy with a counselor may help you learn how to manage stress.\n\nQuit smoking : If you smoke and find it hard to quit, speak to your doctor about options that may help you.\n\n: If you smoke and find it hard to quit, speak to your doctor about options that may help you. Undergo regular heart disease screening: Talk to your doctor about how often you should be screened for heart disease and what tests you should have.\n\nIf you experience any signs or symptoms of a heart attack or stroke, call 9-1-1 immediately for emergency help.\n\nLiving with a chronic disease such as psoriasis has its challenges, but by being proactive and and taking care of yourself, you can reduce your risks for heart disease and other illnesses.", "name": "What Psoriasis Does to Your Heart", "description": "While psoriasis is a skin disease, it can also affect other parts of your body—including your heart.", "url": "https://healthguides.cnn.com/advances-in-psoriasis-treatment/what-psoriasis-does-to-your-heart?did=t1_atftxt", "id": "bf740eac295f4f41eb1ae00b2824edd8fbe71933", "keywords": ["help", "does", "know", "disease", "doctor", "risk", "stress", "dont", "dr", "psoriasis", "heart"], "timestamp": "2016-06-13T18:56:43+00:00"}

Describing a “leadership style” that is “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective,” the official cited “early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment” that were dropped because “no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis.” Instead, he said, cooler heads are seeking “to steer the administration in the right direction until—one way or another—it’s over.”\n\nControversy has focused mostly on whether this official should be praised for curbing Trump or blasted for writing anonymously. But there’s another question that’s trickier: Can the 25th Amendment be used to send Trump back to Manhattan? Ratified in 1967, the amendment has four sections. Section 1 restated more or less what’s in the Constitution: that if the president is removed from office because of death or resignation, the vice president becomes president. Section 2 allows for the replacement of the vice president when the office is vacant; it was used to make Gerald Ford vice president after Spiro Agnew’s resignation in 1973, and to install Nelson Rockefeller after Ford’s ascension to the presidency. Section 3 sets forth when and how the president can voluntarily transfer his powers temporarily—as, for example, George W. Bush did twice when undergoing colonoscopies. But this debate centers on Section 4, which has never been invoked. This section lets the vice president and a majority of Cabinet secretaries (“or such body as Congress may by law provide”) declare the president “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” making the vice president the “Acting President” until the president, through a complex process, is deemed fit to return to office.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCan Trump be removed from office under this amendment? Or would doing so provoke a constitutional crisis, as the Times’ essayist feared? Some critics have attacked the official for not going forward with Section 4, suggesting that the internal undermining of Trump is dangerous or undemocratic. The history of the 25th Amendment, however, suggests that our unnamed informer is on solid ground.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe concern with presidential inability dates at least to the 1880s, when an assassin shot President James Garfield, who lay dying for 79 days. During that long stretch, Garfield was largely unable to carry out any presidential duties, but these were summer months, the presidency was a less substantial office, and, while some matters went neglected, no urgent need for his leadership arose. Still, Vice President Chester Arthur and others debated how to proceed, and Arthur did not want to look like a usurper. The original text of the Constitution says that in case of presidential inability, the powers and duties of the office devolve on the vice president—but it doesn’t say what constitutes inability or how it is determined. In his December 1881 message to Congress, Arthur, now president, noted many unresolved questions: “What is the intendment of the Constitution in its specification of ‘inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office’ as one of the contingencies which calls the Vice-President to the exercise of Presidential functions? Is the inability limited in its nature to long-continued intellectual incapacity, or has it a broader import? What must be its extent and duration? How must its existence be established?” He called on Congress to take up these and other related questions.\n\nBy the time of Woodrow Wilson’s presidency, however, the answers remained murky. And when Wilson suffered a major stroke in 1919, there was renewed discussion of legislation to clarify these questions. But the Republican-led Congress took no action to remove Wilson, even temporarily, fearing Democratic reprisals and voter backlash. Wilson himself showed no inclination to resign. In the event, his wife, Edith, nicknamed the “Presidentress,” and Wilson’s doctor and friend, Dr. Cary T. Grayson—neither of whom were elected officials—ended up making many decisions in his name.\n\nEfforts to resolve the issue took on new urgency in the nuclear age, when the danger of a mentally unfit or incapacitated president starting a war assumed apocalyptic dimensions. Dwight Eisenhower suffered several health crises, including a heart attack in 1955, a bout of crippling ileitis in 1956, and a stroke in 1957. His precarious health, and the ugly reputation of his vice president, Richard Nixon, prompted Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1956, to warn voters about putting Nixon one heartbeat away from nuclear control. In March 1958, after winning reelection, Eisenhower and Nixon signed an agreement providing that in the event of presidential inability, the president would inform the vice president (if possible) and the vice president would serve as acting president, exercising the powers and duties of the office. The president himself would decide when he was no longer inabled—notably, legislators used that word and not “disabled,” which can imply a surmountable handicap—and reassume the powers and duties of the office. John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson signed a similar agreement in 1961.\n\nKennedy’s assassination in 1963, along with the continuing specter of nuclear war, finally spurred the ratification of an amendment to resolve the confusion. Although Kennedy died quickly, people wondered what would have happened if he had lingered comatose in Parkland Hospital. “Has the Congress prepared the presidency adequately for the possibilities of a violent age?” New York Times columnist James Reston asked. “Is the rule of presidential succession satisfactory for these days of human madness and scientific destruction?”\n\n\n\n***\n\nSenator Birch Bayh of Indiana led the charge for a remedy. Drawing on the work of a young member of the American Bar Association, John D. Feerick, Bayh argued that Congress had to solve the questions around entitled inability—how it is defined, who initiates the question of whether it has occurred, who resolves the issue when it has been raised, and who decides if and when the inability has ended. Bayh drafted an amendment that made its way through Congress. Senate Minority Leader Everett M. Dirksen emerged as a key opponent; though he also favored an amendment, he wanted the broadest language possible that would empower Congress to determine presidential inability—a “blank check,” in Bayh’s view. In contrast, Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York wanted the amendment to define “inability” more closely, with more precision about the “gravity” and “duration” of the incapacity that would warrant action. Short of that, he wished for examples of what did not count as an inability.\n\nDuring hearings in 1964 and 1965, members of Congress debated what constituted “inability” in Sections 3 and 4. Some, such as Representative Richard Poff of Virginia, suggested that Section 4 should be used when the president was simply “unable or unwilling to make any rational decision.” But the burden of the congressional commentary was to conclude, as Feerick wrote, that “unpopularity, incompetence, impeachable conduct, poor judgment, and laziness [did] not constitute an ‘inability’ within the meanings of the amendment.”\n\nSo what did count? In a 1992 book, The President Has Been Shot, physician Herbert L. Abrams examined the situations in which the amendment’s framers intended for Sections 3 and 4 to be invoked. Section 3—the temporary transfer of power—applied, in his judgment, during “planned, major surgery,” other surgery requiring general anesthesia, and “the use of psychoactive drugs in significant amounts.” It could also be invoked, he said, in the event of “serious presidential illness”; “the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or of any other progressive, mentally disabling conditions”; if the president or his physician believed “that an illness, injury, or emotional condition is interfering with his judgment or ability to govern”; or during “any anticipated situations in which the president will be unable to communicate with his government,” such as a nuclear strike.\n\nAs for Section 4, Abrams said its use was more “complicated and delicate.” It applied during such serious situations as “loss of consciousness,” “significant alterations of the president’s cognitive faculties or inability to communicate,” “serious injury to the president following an accident or attack on his person,” “terminal illness,” and “progressive, mentally disabling conditions.”\n\nThe legislative debate over the amendment and the prevailing interpretations of its meanings suggest that, despite its vagueness, it doesn’t apply to someone like Trump. Trump has an extreme personality, with many negative qualities—as the Times' op-ed writer notes, he is “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.” Some might judge him to be a grandiose narcissist or even a pathological liar. But having a personality disorder or even certain forms of mental illness doesn’t necessarily render a president unfit to govern (Lincoln suffered from depression). And in fact, Trump is not “unable” to serve as president, as would be required to invoke the 25th Amendment. He is actually a high-achieving, high-functioning person who has excelled in business, entertainment and now politics. He hasn’t suffered from a crippling stroke, a psychotic break or dementia. He is, we would argue, temperamentally unsuited to be president—but that is a reason to vote against him, not to resort to a never-used clause in a constitutional amendment. If Cabinet officers tried to use Section 4, Trump would surely challenge them in court and in the court of public opinion—setting up a constitutional crisis that would make the Clinton impeachment and Bush v. Gore look like schoolyard spats. Trump might conceivably refuse to leave office even if ordered by the Supreme Court—at which point Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ loyalties would really be tested.\n\nSo what can be done to rein in Trump’s “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective” style? According to the Constitution, impeachment is supposed to be used only for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” Even if Trump has committed such crimes, convicting him would require the votes of 17 Republican senators—which aren’t likely to be forthcoming soon. For those who worry about Trump’s governance, the answer is to vote him out when he’s up for reelection, in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the best hope for the nation is for senior officials in the administration who are less impulsive and more reasonable than Trump to mitigate his worst inclinations—precisely what the anonymous White House official says some are attempting to do. Doing so is fully constitutional and far from unprecedented: Nixon’s aides often defied orders he made while drunk or in an emotional froth, and Reagan’s advisers famously sought to quietly set things right when his inattention or rhetorical recklessness caused trouble, as often happened. The Trump officials who are using their duly constituted power to try to avert disaster may or may not be “unsung heroes,” but surely it is better than the alternative—of trying to exploit a clause in the Constitution to cashier a president through nonelective means.\n\nDavid Greenberg, a professor of history and journalism and media studies at Rutgers, is a contributing editor at Politico Magazine.

Tom Kean of New Jersey, a Republican who chaired the 9/11 Commission, and former Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), the commission’s vice chairman — don’t criticize Trump and avoid any hints at partisanship.

In Iraq, the extremists were offering unhappy Sunni Muslims an alternative to the Shiite-dominated central government.\n\nCountries such as Russia and China, meanwhile, have increased their economic and military outreach to the governments of “fragile states.” The assistance offered by China and Russia, such as loans or military aid, generally doesn’t come with requirements to respect human rights, exhibit transparency or other facets of good governance.\n\nThis lets China and Russia bolster their influence, and also “allows predatory governments to avoid reforms and has been shown to have increased corruption.” Populations in the developing states are more likely to lose faith in their governments and, as a result, be more willing to support alternative rule offered by extremists.\n\nIn Africa, the report states, “Moscow is by far the largest weapons supplier. … When the United States denied Nigeria’s request for Cobra attack helicopters because of human rights concerns, Russia stepped in and also agreed to train Nigerian security forces.”\n\nChina, the report notes, is “Africa’s largest single-country trade partner and its biggest creditor,” to the point where some African countries’ failure to repay their loans could allow the Chinese to take control of much of their infrastructure.\n\nSeparately, regional rivalries, such as that between Iran and Saudi Arabia, are fueling violence, extremist ideology and despair across the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nIran, the report states, is “operating more than a hundred religious institutions in Africa.” The Saudis, who between 1982 and 2005 “spent $75 billion to fund mosques, madrassas and religious television channels,” are lashing out at Iran in places like Yemen.\n\nIntra-Arab rivalries, such as that between the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are further exacerbating tensions, the report states.\n\nThe report is the first of at least two to be produced by the Task Force on Extremism in Fragile States. The first focuses on laying out the reasoning behind why a new strategy to prevent extremism is needed and establishing some principles of what it should look like; the next report, due in 2019, will propose a comprehensive strategy to implement.\n\nThe task force was established at the behest of Congress and is housed at the U.S. Institute of Peace. Its members include prominent Republicans and Democrats, including Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser for Trump.\n\nThe report selectively quotes Trump to buttress some of its points. It emphasizes aspects of the fight against terrorism that might appeal to him, such as by criticizing Iran.\n\n“It was not intended as a rebuke of the president in any way, shape or form,” said Stephen Hadley, a national security adviser to former President George W. Bush who served on the task force. “The co-chairs made very clear that our objective is to try to create a bipartisan consensus that would embrace both the executive branch and the Congress on how to address this problem.”\n\nIn a call with reporters, Hamilton and Kean cast the new report as a way to follow up on the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission. The commission had three main recommendations: attack terrorists and their organizations; protect against and prepare for terrorist attacks; and stop the growth of terrorism.\n\nThe new report “in a way is the continuation of the third point of the 9/11 report — that you have to find a way to prevent terrorism to begin with,” Kean said.\n\nThe pair also stressed that they’ve been encouraged by their contacts with aides to the president. “Obviously, they’re not going to commit to something one way or the other, but they have said they ‘like what we are doing, we want to keep in touch with you, we think it can be useful to us,’” Kean said.\n\nIntentionally or not, the report’s recommendations highlight Trump’s often-inconsistent approach to foreign affairs — a personal vision that can seem out of sync with his own administration’s official National Security Strategy.\n\nThe report says the United States needs to partner with other governments, local and national, to come up with strategies to reduce the allure of extremism. But Trump, through his rhetoric and use of tariffs, has badly rattled America’s relationships with even some of its staunchest allies, raising concerns about the ability of alliances such as NATO to present a united front on global challenges.\n\nTrump has also sought to improve relations with Russia, even though his administration, under congressional pressure, has imposed sanctions and taken other measures to rein in Moscow. The president has at times praised the Chinese leadership, but he has also slapped tariffs on the Asian giant.\n\nWhile Trump took office promising to “bomb the s--- out of” terrorists, he has made human rights and the promotion of democracy a low priority while expressing favorable views toward autocratic leaders. The report, meanwhile, stresses that it is crucial to motivate governments in fragile states to be more transparent, less corrupt and more responsive to their citizens.\n\nFuture U.S. efforts to strengthen fragile states don’t have to be expensive, the report states — a possibly subtle signal to Trump, who has tried to dramatically slash U.S. spending on foreign aid only to run into resistance from Congress.\n\nThe report acknowledges that strengthening fragile states to resist extremism and improve governance is the work of many years: “We cannot solve the problem of extremism within the term of a single presidential administration.”\n\nIts conclusion, however, is that there’s no time to waste.\n\n“For a preventive strategy to succeed, it will need to outpace attempts by extremist groups to undermine fragile states,” the report states. “The time to put a preventive strategy in place is now.”\n\n", "name": "Growing Russian and Chinese influence could spark extremism, task force says", "description": "The report is authored by key members of the 9/11 commission.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/11/russia-china-trump-extremism-report-813718", "id": "a854751782e9eb91a39e44e199e8c984d3e189c3", "keywords": ["president", "way", "russia", "fragile", "states", "trump", "task", "russian", "chinese", "extremism", "force", "spark", "governments", "report", "influence", "growing"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

Shortly after the election, Trump announced a 35 percent tax on companies that moved jobs overseas. And now, Trump shows little sign of backing off an escalating trade war, using the blunt instrument of tariffs to bludgeon China and other countries while U.S. manufacturers seek cover from foreign retaliation.\n\nBut as other executives and trade associations take a public stand against the president, the National Association of Manufacturers and its president, Jay Timmons, have struck a close — if still uneasy — partnership with Trump, betting it’s wiser to be on the inside than out as the administration wages a risky fight with the global business community.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“You can scream and yell all you want. I’ve never particularly found that to be effective,” Timmons said in an interview, when asked about corporate pushback on Trump’s tariffs. “We have somebody who is in office who has had a very specific view of the world when it comes to trade—for four decades—so he’s going to do what he’s going to do.”\n\nTimmons has emerged as an unlikely Washington power center under the Trump administration, enjoying easy West Wing access and a bond with a president whose tactics have unnerved NAM’s largest members even as Trump plays industry booster on a national stage.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Timmons has redirected resources to take advantage of NAM’s new platform and amped up hiring, bringing on White House spokesman Michael Short, Mitch McConnell speechwriter Brian Forest, and Michael Shapiro, a former adviser to House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nOn Friday, Timmons announced a multimillion-dollar acquisition of the Manufacturing Leadership Council, a research and networking group — a deal that will expand NAM’s reach.\n\nTrump has benefited, too. NAM regularly supplies the White House with factory-floor venues — and a ready audience — for rallies and events. Timmons himself was instrumental in pushing tax reform legislation, helping the president land a crucial and early policy win. The trade group keeps the White House supplied with success stories to help Trump boast about his progress.\n\nTimmons has also struck up a rapport with the president, despite their strikingly different styles and backgrounds.\n\nTrump roared in to drain the swamp in Washington, a place Timmons has called home since 1983. Trump is a grandstander, quick to anger, who has been married three times. Timmons, an openly gay husband and father of three, is soft-spoken and not easily provoked. Trump came up in the rough-and-tumble world of New York real estate. Timmons has roots in Rust-Belt manufacturing.\n\n“We’re not focused on personality, politics or process,” Timmons said, explaining NAM’s relationship with Trump. “I don’t think of us as bipartisan, I think of us as post-partisan.”\n\nTimmons met Trump for the first time in June 2016 at the invitation of campaign donor Harold Hamm, CEO of energy company Continental Resources. In a two-hour meeting with other industry executives at Trump Tower, Timmons made a pitch for free trade and tax cuts. He left impressed with Trump’s questions.\n\nThat didn’t stop him from taking a shot at the candidate later that month in an op-ed supporting TPP after Trump called it a “disaster.”\n\n“Some politicians have decided that it’s better for their political careers to spread myths about the TPP—and other trade agreements—than to deal with the facts,” Timmons wrote. “They have chosen to mislead voters.” Tagging Trump, he followed up with a tweet calling the candidate’s protectionism “a plan for losing.”\n\nThe relationship continued being rocky after the election, when Trump threatened to slap a steep tax on companies that outsource and went after the Air Force One contract owned by Boeing, a NAM board member.\n\nYet the incoming administration assured manufacturers it had their backs. Two days after the Boeing threat, Vice President-elect Mike Pence was at NAM headquarters promising to make good on a manufacturing agenda. Trump’s transition team asked NAM Chairman David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric, to compile a list of regulations the industry wanted to kill.\n\nIt helped that Timmons had an early in. He was friends with Rick Dearborn from their days on the Hill, when Timmons worked for Sen. George Allen of Virginia and Dearborn was with Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Dearborn led the Trump transition and eventually would be named a White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nBy March of last year, Timmons and his members were in the West Wing talking tax reform with the president. As the meeting wound up, Trump issued an impromptu invitation.\n\n“I was sitting next to the president and the meeting was over and he said, ‘Well OK, well thank you very much. Hey, does everybody want to see my office?’” Timmons said. “He says, ‘Come on, follow me.’”\n\nTimmons, a player in Washington politics for decades, had never been inside the Oval Office. That visit wouldn’t be his last.\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, speaks during a meeting at the White House on March 31, 2017. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\nThe Timmons-Trump alliance was cemented during tax reform. Timmons was key to getting the legislation passed, according to former Senate aides, pushing tax breaks for mom-and-pop businesses and providing cover to Republican members who took politically risky votes. Timmons pitched the final bill as a fair deal for businesses, helping ensure its passage.\n\nBut in the thick of the tax battle, Timmons broke from the White House, going to the mat against a Trump nominee. Trump had appointed Scott Garrett to lead the Export-Import Bank, which guarantees loans for foreign buyers of U.S. exports. As a congressman from New Jersey, Garrett had pushed to shutter the agency, and had enraged some members of his own party by withholding dues to the National Republican Congressional Committee because it recruited gay candidates.\n\nWhen Timmons called the White House to talk about the importance of the bank, Trump called him back. It was another first for Timmons.\n\n“He returned the call. I appreciated that,” Timmons said. “I’ve never had a president call me before.”\n\nThe kinship continued. In September 2017, in the thick of the tax and Ex-Im battles, Trump used a meeting of NAM’s board of directors to give a major speech predicting the tax bill would be “rocket fuel” for the economy. Timmons thanked Trump with a red bumper sticker that said “Friend of Manufacturing.”\n\nA month later, it was Trump’s turn to play host. From the Oval Office, the president declared Oct. 6, 2017, National Manufacturing Day. Timmons and more than a dozen NAM members posed behind the Resolute Desk to mark the occasion.\n\n“That was one of the best days of my life,” Timmons said. “It represented everything we’ve been working for.”\n\nWhen the Senate rejected Garrett’s nomination in December, Trump didn’t lash out at Timmons. He asked for new candidates. One name offered up by NAM: Kimberly Reed, a Treasury official under President George W. Bush. When Trump nominated her, Timmons praised the pick as a “sterling choice.”\n\nThe president signed the tax bill into law a few days later, and Reed’s confirmation looks assured.\n\nThe wins kept coming for both sides. Four months after tax cuts took effect, a NAM survey found evidence they were working, handing Trump an opportunity to crow about his signature legislative win in a Rose Garden ceremony. Timmons was back at the West Wing in May, working on the administration’s apprenticeship program with Ivanka Trump and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta.\n\nNow the Trump-Timmons partnership is being tested as the president marches the country toward a full-blown trade war and NAM has shown little power to stop him. He has upended decades-old trade treaties and questioned the loyalty of multinational corporations. Another $200 billion in China tariffs is in the works and automakers could be targeted next. The president on Friday threatened even more punishing taxes on Chinese imports if Beijing doesn’t change its trade and technology policies.\n\nBut while organizations like the National Retail Federation have publicly scolded Trump for a “reckless escalation,” Timmons has taken a more diplomatic tack.\n\n“It’s not the way I would negotiate it, but the last time I looked I wasn’t elected president,” Timmons said. “If this is a better way to encourage investment here in the United States, and create jobs and wage growth, we’ll have to see.”\n\nBut as trade conflicts mount, NAM’s diverse membership is giving Timmons some room to maneuver. In 2006, NAM’s smaller members mounted a revolt against the multinationals that typically set the group’s trade agenda, pushing them to endorse legislation that would give the U.S. power to retaliate against China and other countries that manipulate their currency to gain an export edge.\n\nThe effort failed, and some of those same small companies now are cheering Trump’s tariffs and big-stick swagger.\n\n“I’m extremely happy,” said William Jones, president of Penn United Technology Inc., a precision tooler near Pittsburgh. “He’s adding tariffs, but the endgame is to bring everybody to the table and renegotiate. We haven’t had anybody to this point willing to do this and play hardball.”\n\nIn June, more than 50 business groups lined up behind legislation that would curb Trump’s ability to impose tariffs for national security reasons. In a letter to Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute and dozens of other groups wrote that they were “deeply concerned” about the president’s unrestricted use of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.\n\nNAM’s signature was conspicuously absent, its influence effectively neutralized by some of its biggest members, which support tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\n“NAM members who are steel consumers feel like we are in Groundhog Day,” said one manufacturing lobbyist unhappy with the group’s low-key approach. “We don't understand why we're here again and our trade association is still sidelined on this issue.”\n\nSo far, Trump isn’t budging on tariffs, and it’s unlikely Timmons can change the president’s mind.\n\n“It’s fair to question the extent to which any outside organization has been able to move the needle on this. But it’s very clear to say that because of the objective approach the NAM has taken, they are taken very seriously by the White House,” said Kevin Kolevar, vice president of government affairs at Dow Chemical Co., a NAM member. “When they publicly disagree, and they do, they’re still a big part of the conversation.”\n\n", "name": "Fighting against Trump’s trade war from within", "description": "As other executives blast the president, the National Association of Manufacturers is gambling that it’s better to stay cozy with Trump.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/11/donald-trump-trade-war-tariffs-813711", "id": "4ce2bd60e261633fd39ebcad2e0ec28430373309", "keywords": ["tax", "white", "president", "trumps", "nam", "war", "trump", "fighting", "house", "trade", "national", "timmons"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

Shortly after the attacks began, the most powerful man in the world, who had been informed of the World Trade Center explosions in a Florida classroom, was escorted to a runway and sent to the safest place his handlers could think of: the open sky.\n\nFor the next eight hours, with American airspace completely cleared of jets, a single blue-and-white Boeing 747, tail number 29000—filled with about 65 passengers, crew and press, and the 43rd president, George W. Bush, as well as 70 box lunches and 25 pounds of bananas—traversed the eastern United States. On board, President Bush and his aides argued about two competing interests—the need to return to Washington and reassure a nation and the competing need to protect the commander in chief. All the while, he and his staff grappled with the aftermath of the worst attack on American soil in their lifetimes, making crucial decisions with only flickering information about the attacks unfolding below. Bush struggled even to contact his family and to reach Vice President Dick Cheney in the White House bunker.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe story of those remarkable hours—and the thoughts and emotions of those aboard—isolated eight miles above America, escorted by three F-16 fighters, flying just below the speed of sound, has never been comprehensively told.\n\nThis oral history, based on more than 40 hours of original interviews with more than two dozen of the passengers, crew and press aboard—including many who have never spoken publicly about what they witnessed that day—traces the story of how an untested president, a sidearm-carrying general, top aides, the Secret Service and the Cipro-wielding White House physician, as well as five reporters, four radio operators, three pilots, two congressmen and a stenographer responded to 9/11.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrologue\n\nAndy Card, chief of staff, White House: We woke up in Sarasota, Florida, at the Colony Resort. There was a terrible stench in the air—the red tide had killed a lot of fish that had washed up on the shore. I remember being struck by that smell coming from Air Force One the night before. We’d gone off to dinner in Tampa. It was unusual for President Bush to stay out late like that, but it was a relaxing evening.\n\nAri Fleischer, press secretary, White House: The day couldn’t have begun any better or more beautifully.\n\nGordon Johndroe, assistant press secretary, White House: The day starts off very normally—the president went for a run, and I took the [press] pool out with the president. I remember I got stung by a bee, and I asked Dr. Tubb if he had something he could give me for the swelling. He said, “Yeah, we’ll get you something when we get to the airplane.” Needless to say, I promptly forgot about it that day.\n\nSonya Ross, reporter, Associated Press: This was a garden variety trip. It was low-ranking staff and a lot of the top journalists didn’t come. It was a scrub trip.\n\nMike Morell, presidential briefer, Central Intelligence Agency: I walked into his suite [for the president’s morning intelligence briefing]; he was surrounded by breakfast foods and he hadn’t touched any of it. He asked me if I’d gone to the beach the night before, and I told him I’d just gone right to bed. The second intifada was well underway then, and the briefings at that time were very heavy on Israeli-Palestinian stuff. A good bit of the briefing that morning was about Israeli matters. There was one thing that caught his attention, and he picked up the phone to call Condi [Rice] to ask her to follow up on it. There was nothing in the briefing about terrorism. It was very routine—just him, me, Andy Card and Deb Loewer from the Situation Room.\n\nAndy Card: The president was in a great mood. He had that George W. Bush strut that morning.\n\nB. Alexander “Sandy” Kress, senior education adviser, White House: The whole point of the trip was education. He was pushing No Child Left Behind as Congress was coming back to Washington. [Secretary of Education] Rod Paige and I briefed him ahead of his remarks to the press. It was a beautiful day—we were in his suite. He was in a really good mood. We were out of the Oval and he was relaxed. Those were probably the last carefree moments he had in his term.\n\nAndy Card: I remember literally telling him, “It should be an easy day.” Those were the words. “It should be an easy day.”\n\n\n\nI. Emma Booker Elementary School, Sarasota, Fla.\n\nAri Fleischer: Back in 2001, no one had iPhones or BlackBerrys. I had this high-tech pager on my belt—it was two-way, in that you could send back one of like 14 preprogrammed responses. For the day, it was pretty fancy-fancy stuff. As we were driving to the first stop for the day, I got a page from Brian Bravo, who put together the White House news clips.\n\nBrian Bravo, press assistant, White House: My job was to just scour the news—TV, the AP wire, Bloomberg. I just spent my time at the desk [in the White House], feeding the news all day to the White House staff. I actually had a buddy in New York who called me. He worked in a tall office tower and had seen the first plane hit. It was word-of-mouth intel, but then I started to see TV starting to cover it. To get to the pagers they used back then on the road, I’d have to parse any story down to a few short words. I just said, “A plane has hit the World Trade Center.” At that point, no one knew what it meant.\n\nAri Fleischer: I got out [of the motorcade] thinking this must’ve been some kind of terrible accident.\n\nBrian Montgomery, director of advance, White House: When the motorcade arrives, I get out and I was running towards the limo—I always run towards the limo—and Mark Rosenker, the head of the White House Military Officer, says to me, “Dr. Rice needs to talk to the president.”\n\nAri Fleischer: Karl Rove told [the president] first.\n\nKarl Rove, senior adviser, White House: We were standing outside the elementary school. My phone rang. It was my assistant Susan Ralston, saying that a plane had hit the World Trade Center—it wasn’t clear whether it was private, commercial, prop, or jet. That’s all she had. The boss was about two feet away. He was shaking hands. I told him the same thing. He arched his eyebrows like, “Get more.”\n\nDave Wilkinson, assistant agent-in-charge, U.S. Secret Service: Eddie Marinzel and I were the two lead agents with the president that day. The head of the detail was back in Washington. We heard, “There’s an incident in New York.”\n\nBrian Montgomery: There was this group of students, all young ladies in uniforms and teachers, all oblivious to all of this. They had no idea what was going on. The president was very gracious and greeted them, and then said, “I need to go take an important telephone call.” He went into the holding room and went directly to the STU-III [the secure telephone].\n\nAri Fleischer: There’s always a secure telephone waiting for the president, but in the nine months he’d been president, I don’t think we’d ever used one before an event like that. Condi was holding for him.\n\nAndy Card: We were standing at the door to the classroom, when a staffer came up and said, simply, “Sir, it appears that a twin-engine prop plane crashed into one of the World Trade Center towers.” We all said something like what a tragedy. I remember I was thinking about the passengers—how much they must’ve worried as they realized what was about to happen. It was only a nanosecond, and then the principal opened the door and the president went into the classroom to meet the students.\n\nBrian Montgomery: We’re trying to get a TV for the hold room—all we could find was this massive 30-inch TV on a cart with rabbit ears.\n\nNew Window ‘The Safest and Most Dangerous Place in the World at the Exact Same Time’: Click to view gallery. | George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\n\nDave Wilkinson: We take everything extremely seriously, anything that could affect the presidency. We began speaking to experts back at the White House. No one knew anything. We’re asking ourselves, “Is there any direction of interest towards the president?” That’s the phrase, “direction of interest.” Or is this just an attack on New York?\n\nSandy Kress: I was back in the media room. There was some buzz about the first plane, people were watching it on a TV. Then there was a stampede across the media room as they saw the second plane hit.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam (R-Florida): I was brand new. I was a freshman [congressman]. We’d gone into the media center, when the main event was going to be, while we wait for the president and the children to read together in the other room. We were clustered around the TV and watched the second plane hit.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark, superintendent of communications, Air Force One: From all indications, it was going to be a simple trip. I had breakfast with one of the navigators, and we were talking about how we were having breakfast in Florida and we’re going to be back in time for lunch.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman, presidential pilot, Air Force One: We were all getting ready, based on the estimated departure time. All of us had already shown up at the plane.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: There were two TV tuners, worldwide television tuners [at my workspace on Air Force One]. They were like old-school rabbit ears—UHF and VHF frequencies. We didn’t have the ability to tune into CNN, Fox, or anything else. It was the Today Show, the strongest signal that day, and they’re showing pictures [of the Towers], smoke billowing out. I saw the second airplane strike. I said, “Oh shit.” I just dropped everything and ran downstairs to get Colonel Tillman: “You’ve got to come see this.”\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: It didn’t make any sense. It’s a clear-and-a-million day.\n\nPresident George W. Bush participates in a reading demonstration the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001, at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. | George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\n\nStaff Sgt. William “Buzz” Buzinski, security, Air Force One: Our job is to protect the asset [Air Force One]. The Secret Service is principal protection. We’re asset protection. We protect the plane 24 hours a day, even after the president has left. One of the advance [Secret Service] agents had told us about the first plane. Then about 17 minutes later, I see the same guy sprinting across the tarmac. He said, “Another plane hit the towers.” I knew instantly it was terrorism. We started to increase security around the plane—made it a tighter bubble.\n\nStaff Sgt. Paul Germain, airborne communications system operator, Air Force One: We thought it was weird even just when the first plane hit. People who know airplanes, that’s some real stuff right there. Big airplanes just don’t hit little buildings. Then, as soon as that second plane hit, that switchboard lit up like a Christmas tree.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: Everything started coming alive. We were hooked into the PEOC [the White House bunker] and the JOC [Joint Operations Center], for the Secret Service. They’re all in the link now.\n\nAndy Card: Another plane hit the other Tower. My mind flashed to three initials: UBL. Usama bin Laden. Then I was thinking that we had White House people there—my deputy, Joe Hagin, and a team were in New York preparing for the U.N. General Assembly. I was thinking that Joe was probably at the World Trade Center, that’s where the Secret Service office was, in the basement.\n\nMike Morell: I was really worried that someone was going to fly a plane into that school. This event had been on schedule for weeks, anyone could have known about it. Eddie [Marinzel, the lead Secret Service agent] wanted to get the hell out of there as fast as possible.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: There’s some debate within the staff that I can hear about how the president needs to address the nation. They’re saying, “We can’t do it here. You can’t do it in front of fifth-graders.” The Secret Service is saying, “You’re doing it here or you’re not doing at all. We’re not taking the time to do it somewhere else. We need to get him secure.”\n\nDave Wilkinson: We’re talking to folks back at the White House, we’re beginning to get the motorcade up and running, getting the motorcycle cops back, we’re ready to evacuate at a moment’s notice. All of a sudden it hits me: The president’s the only one who doesn’t know that this plane has hit the second building. It was a discomfort to all of us that the president didn’t know. The event was dragging on, and that’s when Andy Card came out.\n\nAndy Card: A thousand times a day, a chief of staff has to ask “Does the president need to know?” This was an easy test to pass. As strange as it sounds, as I was standing there waiting to talk to the president, I was reflecting on another time that I’d had to be the calm one: I’d been acting chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush when he threw up on the Japanese prime minister. I was all business in that moment. He’d refused to get in the ambulance—he didn’t want anyone to see the president get in the ambulance—and in the limo, he’s still sick and he’s getting sick on me. In the hotel, I take out my laminated “in case of emergency” card. I went down my checklist. I was telling people, “He’s not dying, he’s still the president.” My job that day was to be calm, cool, and collected. Not the same magnitude, of course, but I knew my job on 9/11 was to be calm, cool, and collected.\n\nAt left, George W.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum\n\nKarl Rove: I remember [Andy Card] pausing at the door, before he went in, it seemed like forever, but it was probably just a couple heartbeats. I never understood why, but he told me, years later, that he needed to spend a moment formulating the words he wanted to use.\n\nAndy Card: When I was standing at the classroom door, I knew I was delivering a message that no president would want to hear. I knew that my message would define the moment. I decided to pass on two facts and an editorial comment. I didn’t want to invite a conversation because the president was sitting in front of the classroom. I entered the room and Ann Compton, of ABC, in the press pool, gestured, “What’s up?” I gestured back to her, two planes crashing. She gestured “What?” Then the teacher asked the students to take out their books, so I took that opportunity to approach the president. I whispered in his ear, “A second plane hit the second Tower. America is under attack.” I took a couple steps back so he couldn’t ask any questions. The students were completely focused on their books. I remember thinking what a bizarre stage we’re standing on. I was pleased with how the president reacted—he didn’t do anything to create fear.\n\nEllen Eckert, stenographer, White House: There are six stenographers who work for the [White House] press office. One of us always travels with the president. I always said I typed fast for a living all over the world. [That morning] was uneventful until Andy walked in.\n\nAri Fleischer: For Andy to interrupt a presidential event, [we knew] it had to be of monumental consequence. You just didn’t do that.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: Everything started lighting up. We saw Andy Card whisper in the president’s ear. We still didn’t know what the hell was going on. We’re just monitoring the Secret Service and staff radio channels. It was chaos. What’s next? All of a sudden, other reports start coming in—explosion at the White House, car bomb at the State Department. We’re under attack. I was 35 years old. My military career and my perspective is, I’m thinking Cold War, the big bad Soviet bear. This was an extensive attack. Could this be a nation-state?\n\nGordon Johndroe: Having been in that room—and it wasn’t an issue until the Michael Moore documentary [Fahrenheit 9/11]—it would have been odd if he’d jumped up and ran from the room. It didn’t seem like an eternity in the room. He finished the book and went back into the hold room.\n\nKarl Rove: When the president walked back into the staff hold, he said, “We’re at war—give me the FBI director and the vice president.”\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine’s email of the week’s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

Dan Miller (R-Fla.), the other congressman traveling with the presidential party, and me], “We might be the only plane back to D.C. today.” He tells us that if we want a ride, we need to not have anyone notice us. If anyone notices us, they won’t let us back on board. We need to be inconspicuous quickly, so we went and just got in our vehicle in the motorcade. You could see the windows and hatches of the motorcade open up, the visible expression of the armaments that are always around the president.\n\nKarl Rove: Eddie Marinzel [from the Secret Service] came up to the president, he was sitting in one of those tiny elementary school chairs, and Eddie said, “We need to get you to Air Force One and get you airborne.” They’d determined this might be an effort to decapitate the government.\n\nDave Wilkinson: We ended up with a compromise—Andy Card said we have a whole auditorium full, waiting for the next event. There was no imminent threat there in Sarasota, so we agreed [the president could give a statement before we left.]\n\nBrian Montgomery: It was the fear of the unknown. We didn’t know if someone had put a biological agent or chemical agent at the school. He went to the auditorium. I remember looking at the students when he said, “America is under attack,” and these girls, their faces were saying, “What’s he’s telling us?”\n\nAndy Card: He gave a very brief statement, he started off and I cringed right away. He said, “I’m going back to Washington, D.C.” And I thought, you don’t know that. We don’t know that. We don’t know where we’re going.\n\nGordon Johndroe: I told the press we’d be leaving right for the motorcade. We have this joke, mostly with the photographers—no running. No running to catch the president. This time, I told them, “Guys, we’re going to have to run. We’re going to have to run to the motorcade.” Going down the highway, our 15-passenger van was barely keeping up.\n\nDave Wilkinson: The motorcade left there and in a very aggressive fashion we got to the aircraft. Intelligence information is always sketchy. When we’re riding is the first time that we hear that’s there’s something vague about a threat to the president. That ratcheted things up.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: On the motorcade back, there are all these protesters—it was still all about the recount—signs like, “Shrub stole the election.”\n\nAndy Card: In the limo, we’re both on our cellphones—he’s frustrated because he can’t reach Don Rumsfeld. It was a very fast limo ride. We didn’t know that the Pentagon had just been attacked, so that’s why we couldn’t get Rumsfeld.\n\nDave Wilkinson: We asked for double-motorcade blocks at the intersection. Double and triple blocks. Not just motorcycle officers standing there with their arms up, but vehicles actually blocking the road. Now we’re worried about a car bomb. The whole way back, we were using the limos as a shell game, to keep the president safe. At the airport, we’re no longer worried about the president waving to people. No handshakes, no hugs goodbye, it’s out of the motorcade, up the stairs, we just don’t know what the hell is going on.\n\nMike Morell: When we got back to the plane, it was ringed by security and Secret Service with automatic weapons. I’d never seen anything like that before. They re-searched everyone before we could reboard, not just the press. They searched Andy Card’s briefcase, he was standing right in front of me in line. They went through my briefcase, which was filled with all these classified materials, but I wasn’t going to object that day.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: As the motorcade’s coming in, I’ve got the 3 and 4 engines were already running.\n\nAndy Card: When the limo door opened, I was struck that the engines on Air Force One were running. That’s normally a protocol no-no.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: You never lose the excitement of seeing the motorcade. I’m on the back stairs watching as they pull up. I was wondering, “What’s the president thinking? What’s Andy Card thinking? What are they doing to make it happen?” You could feel it. You could feel the tension. We’d been attacked on our soil. You could see it on their face—Andy Card, Ari Fleischer, the president.\n\nSonya Ross: They brought out the bomb-sniffing dogs. They were drooling all [over] the luggage. I had dog spittle all over my bags.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Everyone other than the president and his senior staff enter through the back stairs, so about 80 percent of the passengers came past us. You could see fear and shock. People couldn’t believe what they had just seen. They didn’t know what to do.\n\nSandy Kress: Getting on the plane was different than it ever had been. There was a lot of attention to our credentials, who we were. We had to show ID and our badge, not just the badge. And this even though the crew knew most of us.\n\nEric Draper, presidential photographer, White House: The Secret Service wanted to get him on the plane as quickly as possible. I figured that I’ve got to stick like glue to the president. Obviously, I know it’s going to be a big day. My goal was to find him as quickly as possible on board, but Andy Card said at the top of the stairs, “Take the batteries out of your cellphone. We don’t want to be tracked.” That brought me up. “Are we a target?” I wasn’t thinking of that.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: President Bush comes up the stairs in Sarasota, now you watch him come up the stairs every day, that famous Texas swagger. He was focused that day. No swagger. He was just trucking up the stairs. He was a man on a mission. As soon as the passengers are on board, I fire [engines] 1 and 2.\n\nAndy Card: We’re starting to roll almost before the president gets into the suite.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: There was one van, maybe a press van, that was parked too close to the plane’s wing. I remember a Secret Service agent running down the aisle; they opened the back stairs, he ran down to move the truck. He never made it back on board. They didn’t wait for him.\n\nGordon Johndroe: We took off and it was something out of [the movie] Independence Day. That thing took off like a rocket. The lamps are shaking they’d fired up the engines so much.\n\nKarl Rove: [Col. Tillman] stood that thing on its tail—just nose up, tail down, like we were on a roller coaster.\n\nEllen Eckert: We were climbing so high and so fast I started to wonder if we’d need oxygen masks.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: It was the uncertainty. As we’re taking off, you’re still getting all this misinformation. Your head was spinning, trying to figure out what had actually happened. The only thing we knew for sure, because we’d seen it with our own eyes, was that the World Trade Center had been hit.\n\nAboard Air Force One, en route to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. Pictured from left are: Andy Card; Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary; Blake Gottesman, Personal Aide to the President; Karl Rove, Senior Adviser; Deborah Loewer, Director of White House Situation Room, and Dan Bartlett, Deputy Assistant to the President. | U.S. National Archives\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb, presidential physician, White House Medical Unit: The people who are the permanent, apolitical staff—the medical unit, the flight crew, the military aide—they were all well-versed in their emergency action plans, irrespective of who the president was, but they—we—didn’t have the relationship yet with the political staff. That trust was still coming. It’s a very different worldview for each side. It’s only time over time that you build those relationships, and there hadn’t been that much time. It’s hard enough for any administration—but that particular transition was so abbreviated and ugly as the 2000 campaign was—it was even harder. Those guys were still trying to put their government together. Everyone was excited because they were just coming back from the summer vacation and felt that they were going to hit their stride.\n\nAndy Card: I really think President Bush—I know President Bush took office on January 20, 2001—but the responsibility of being president became a reality when I whispered in his ear. I honestly believe as he contemplated what I said, I took an oath. Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. It’s not cutting taxes, it’s not No Child Left Behind, it’s not immigration, it’s the oath. When you pick a president, you want to pick a president who can handle the unexpected. This was the unexpected. That’s what the president was wrestling with that day. He recognized the cold reality of his responsibilities.\n\nEric Draper: Soon after we got on board, I see [the president] pop out of the cabin, he’s heading down the aisle. He says, “OK boys, this is what they pay us for.” I’ll never forget that.\n\nAndy Card: Even before we left the school, there was angst from the Secret Service that we don’t know what’s out there. As we were boarding the plane, someone had picked a reference to “Angel.” That’s the code name for Air Force One. Is someone sitting around with a Stinger missile? Was someone waiting for us at Andrews? Mark [Tillman] was reluctant to fly us back to Washington.\n\nKaren Hughes, communications director, White House: September 10th was my anniversary, so I had stayed back in Washington. I was scheduled to do a Habitat for Humanity event with [Secretary of Housing and Urban Development] Mel Martinez that required us to wear blue jeans. President Bush didn’t allow blue jeans in the West Wing, so I’d just planned to spend the morning at home. When the attacks began, the vice president sent a military driver to pick me up and bring me to the White House, because D.C.’s streets were so clogged.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg, F-16 pilot, call-sign “Hooter,” 111th Fighter Squadron, Houston: I had just gotten off alert at Ellington Field [in Houston], normally we pull 24-hour alerts, mostly for drug interdiction. I’d just gotten back into bed and was watching TV and saw the reports of a plane hitting the tower. Being an airline pilot, an air defense pilot, and the operations officer for the 111th, this was something that intrigued me. I wanted to stay up to see what happened. Then when that second plane hit, it eliminated any doubt. I had to get back to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Airborne, Somewhere over the Gulf of Mexico\n\nThe president’s private cabin and office, the “airborne Oval Office,” sit at the front of Air Force One on the main deck; stairs lead up to the flight deck and communications suite. Other cabins house the White House Medical Unit, staff, guests, security, the press and crew.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: The initial conversation was that we’d take him to an Air Force base, no less than an hour away from Washington. Maybe let’s go ahead and try to get him to Camp David. That all changed when we heard there was a plane headed towards Camp David.\n\nI made the takeoff, climbed out, probably 25,000 to 30,000—I gave it to the backup pilot. I had three pilots on board that day. I said just keep flying towards Washington.\n\nAri Fleischer: As we were flying out of Sarasota, we were able to get some TV reception. They broke for commercial. I couldn’t believe it. A hair-loss commercial comes on. I remember thinking, in the middle of all this, I’m watching this commercial for hair loss.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: Jacksonville Center [Air Traffic Control] was warning us about an unidentified plane in the area. I said let’s change direction and see if it follows. It didn’t.\n\nAndy Card: Blake Gottesman was my personal aide, but he was filling in that day as the president’s aide. I said, “Blake, it’s your job to make sure that people don’t come up to the suite.” No one comes up unless the president calls for them.\n\nAri Fleischer: We got a report there are six aircraft still flying in the U.S. that aren’t responding and could still be hijacked. We’re thinking that there are still six missiles still in the sky. We’re getting a report that a plane “was down near Camp David.”\n\nKarl Rove: Andy and I are there with the president. The president gets this call from Cheney—we didn’t know who it was at the time, we just knew the phone rang. He said “yes,” then there was a pause as he listened. Then another “yes.” You had an unreal sense of time that whole day. I don’t know whether it was 10 seconds or two minutes. Then he said, “You have my authorization.” Then he listens for a while longer. He closes off the conversation. He turns to us and says that he’s just authorized the shoot-down of hijacked airliners.\n\nI’d never heard the word ‘decapitation attack’ before.”\n\nAndy Card: The president is sitting at his desk, and I’m sitting directly in front of him. I witness the president authorize the Air National Guard to shoot down the hijacked airliners. The conversation was sobering to hear. What struck me was as soon as he hung up the phone, he said, “I was an Air National Guard pilot—I’d be one of the people getting this order. I can’t imagine getting this order.” There was a greater degree of reality than many other presidents would have experienced.\n\nKarl Rove: He was so even-handed. He was just so naturally calm during the day.\n\nDave Wilkinson: We didn’t expect the breakdown of communications. Every kind of communication that day was challenged. Even the president talking to the Situation Room was challenged. The communications network did not hold up.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: All the comms that we would normally have, some of them are no longer available. We’ve got multiple systems—commercial and terrestrial systems—and they’re all jammed. I started to have tunnel vision: What the hell is going on? Did someone sabotage our comms? It wasn’t until later I realized all the commercial systems were all just saturated. It was all the same systems the airplane pilots were using at the same time, talking to their dispatchers. We as Air Force One didn’t have any higher priority than American This or United That.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We started having to use the military satellites, which we would only use in time of war.\n\nAri Fleischer: I’d never heard the word \"decapitation attack\" before, but people like Andy, who had been there during the Cold War and had the training, he knew what was going on. The training and the thinking of the military and the Secret Service is just so profoundly different, but that was the psychology and mood that took hold aboard Air Force One. There are still missiles out there and the Secret Service says to the president, “We don’t think it’s safe for you to return to Washington.”\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: It was very somber [at the air base]. We got these cryptic messages from Southeast Air Defense Sector. We knew we’re on the hook now—it might not be for Air Force One, but for anything. Houston’s the fifth-largest metro region, it’s got all this oil and gas infrastructure. I asked maintenance to put live missiles and arm up the guns. Two heat-seeking missiles and rounds from a 20-mm gun isn’t a lot to take on a hijacked plane, but it was the best we could do.\n\nAndy Card: Then we hear that Flight 93’s gone down. We’re all wondering, Did we do that? It wasn’t a big deal on the plane. It lingered deepest in the president’s conscience. Most people on the plane hadn’t been privy to that conversation.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: All of us thought, we assumed we shot it down.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: All the folks were coming up to the communications deck with various requests, a Secret Service agent comes up and says, “The president wants to know the status of the first family.” He had this look on his face. I have to tell him I don’t have a way to find out. I can’t fathom what that was like for the president.\n\nDave Wilkinson: Once we heard a plane had crashed into the Pentagon, that’s when we said, “Well, we’re not going to go back to Washington.” It’s all about that “direction of interest.” At the start, the threat’s right now in New York. Then the plane hit the Pentagon, and it was about our seats of government. Hearing all of this, we’re thinking that the further we’re away from Washington, the safer we are.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We get this report that there’s a call saying “Angel was next.” No one really knows now where the comment came from—it got mistranslated or garbled amid the White House, the Situation Room, the radio operators. “Angel” was our code name. The fact that they knew about “angel,” well, you had to be in the inner circle. That was a big deal to me. It was time to hunker down and get some good weaponry.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: We dispatched two fighters to go protect Air Force One.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: Now our security’s tremendous, but we had press on board, there were press that weren’t part of our regular traveling party. We put a cop at the base of the stairs. No one was allowed upstairs. That was something we’d never done before.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Will Chandler [the lead Air Force security officer] was summoned to the front. Then he stayed up there, providing security at the cockpit stairs. That got us thinking: Is there an insider threat? [Colonel Tillman’s] putting someone at the flight deck. You just don’t know who’s who.\n\nStaff Sgt. Paul Germain: Colonel Tillman says at that point, “Let’s just go cruise around the Gulf for a little bit.” That was our Pearl Harbor. You train for nuclear war, then you get into something like that. All the money they pumped into us for training, that worked. We could read each other’s minds.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Will [Chandler] told us, “Guys, this is our time. 100 percent security, all of the time. We gotta get the president back.”\n\nDave Wilkinson: Colonel Tillman took us to a height where if an aircraft was coming towards us, we’d know it was no mistake. Talking to him, I was confident we were safer in the air than we were anywhere on the ground.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: I took us up to 45,000 feet. That’s about as high as a 747 can go. I figured I wanted to be above all the other air traffic, especially since everyone was descending to land.\n\nAnn Compton, reporter, ABC News: We were standing in the press cabin. A lot of people were too nervous to sit down. A Secret Service agent was in the aisle and he pointed at the monitor and said, “Look down there, Ann, we’re at 45,000 feet and we have no place to go.”\n\nKarl Rove: There was acrimony. President Bush doesn’t raise his voice. He doesn’t pound the desk. But as we made it across the Florida peninsula, they [Andy Card and Tom Gould] kept raising objections [about returning to Washington]. At one point, Cheney and Rumsfeld called [and advised against returning to Washington].\n\nAri Fleischer: Andy took the side of the Secret Service. Looking back, it’s pretty obvious that you don’t put Air Force One down at a known, predictable location when the attack’s still unfolding. You preserve the office of the president. It was pretty straightforward.\n\nDave Wilkinson: He fought with us tooth and nail all day to go back to Washington. We basically refused to take him back. The way we look at is that by federal law, the Secret Service has to protect the president. The wishes of that person that day are secondary to what the law expects of us. Theoretically it’s not his call, it’s our call.\n\nEric Draper: As a group, you had Tom Gould, Andy Card, and a couple Secret Service guys saying you couldn’t return to Washington. He was visibly frustrated and very angry. I was just a few feet away, and it felt like he was looking through me. It was really intense. He just turned away in anger.\n\nKarl Rove: Gould came in and said, “Mr. President, we don’t have a full fuel load. We’ve got too many extraneous people on board. We can’t loiter over Washington if we need to.” He suggested, let’s get to a military base, drop off the unessential personnel, fill up with fuel, and reassess. The president got the argument, but he wasn’t happy about it.\n\nAri Fleischer: We didn’t have satellite TV on the plane. The news would frustratingly come in and go out. So I was not aware of the punishing coverage that the president was receiving for not returning to Washington. The anchors were all asking, “Where’s Bush?” They instantly criticized him.\n\nSonya Ross: We didn’t know where we were going, but they must’ve been circling, because we kept watching the local feed of a Florida station going in and out. That was our tiny window into the outside world.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: We had limited communications, that’s for sure, but the president and Air Force One were never without secure communications. We just had two lines—one for the president and one for the mil aide. We were never out of touch entirely. All the other staff or the other Secret Service agent, we just couldn’t provide them the calls they needed. There were a couple times when the vice president wasn’t available, but we never lost communications with the ground.\n\nAndy Card: One of the president’s first thoughts, from Sarasota to Barksdale, was Vladimir Putin.\n\nAmerica could have had no better ally on 9/11 than Russia and Putin.”\n\nGordon Johndroe: [Putin] was important—all these military systems were all put in place for nuclear alerts. If we went on alert, we needed Putin to know that we weren’t readying an attack on Russia. He was great—he said immediately that Russia wouldn’t respond, Russia would stand down, that he understood we were under attack and needed to be on alert.\n\nAri Fleischer: Putin was fantastic that day. He was a different Vladimir Putin in 2001. America could have had no better ally on September 11th than Russia and Putin.\n\nEllen Eckert: We were watching that second plane hit on a replay. It wasn’t hitting me yet what had happened, until I saw that second plane hit. I remember thinking “Holy mother of God.” I was sitting back with the press corps and they said, “Go find out what’s happening.” I’m like, “Oh, right, they’re going to tell the steno what’s happening.” Ari came back to the press cabin, and said, “Please don’t call anybody, please don’t tell anyone where we are for national safety, keep our location secure.” Everyone said, “Absolutely, how’s the president?” Everyone was really obedient.\n\nSonya Ross: Khue Bui [one of the photographers] was crouched in front of me and we were talking about our families, people we knew in New York. Ann [Compton of ABC News] and I were trying to come up with timelines—what time was it when Andy Card came in and whispered to the president. Ann’s time and my time were about two minutes apart. We were listening through headsets to the television, but we weren’t really paying attention. Then I heard the reporter say, “The tower’s collapsing.” I looked at the TV and had a completely shocked reaction. I heard Khue’s camera snap.\n\nEric Draper: We were in the president’s office when the Towers fell. You knew that there’d be a loss of life in a catastrophic way. The room was really silent. Andy Card, Ari, and Dan Bartlett were there. There’s an image of the president, with his hands on his hips, just watching. Dan had a friend who worked in the Towers. He was very emotional. Everyone peeled off one by one and the president just stood there, alone, watching the cloud expand.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: There were times when the emotion would just well up. Just that sick feeling, that sorrow. It was the overwhelming stress, like when a friend or family member is dying. That’s the closest thing I can explain what it felt like that day.\n\nAndy Card: I asked the military aides, “Where are we going?” I want options. I want a long runway, a secure place, good communications. They came back and said Barksdale AFB. I said, “Don’t tell anyone we’re coming.”\n\nDave Wilkinson: Colonel Tillman said, “What about Barksdale?” It was about 45 minutes away. We discussed it, it’s the perfect compromise—it’s close and it’s secure and we can let off a lot of passengers there. We needed somewhere that had armored vehicles.\n\nBush confers with, from left, Karl Rove, Andy Card, Dan Bartlett and Ari Fleischer, prior to delivering remarks at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. | U.S. National Archives\n\nAndy Card: I went into the president’s cabin and told the president, “We’re going Barksdale.” And he said, “No, we’re going back to the White House.” He was pretty hot with me. “I’m making the decision, we’re going back to Washington, D.C.” He’s firm as can be. I just kept saying, “I don’t think you want to make that decision right now.” He went back and forth. It wasn’t one conversation, it was five, six, seven conversations. He was really frustrated with me.\n\nEric Draper: I remember following the president and Andy Card into the nose of the plane, the president’s cabin. They’re in a very heated discussion over returning to Washington. They’re arguing, but also having the president take telephone calls at the same time. They’re watching the live news coverage. It was controlled chaos.\n\nAndy Card: We were all thinking about the very credible idea that there was more to come. Is there a plane heading to Los Angeles? A plane headed for Chicago? Something on the train? Is there a truck bomb heading across the George Washington Bridge? We had lots of angst over the White House itself. We even had the fog of war trying to figure what was going on in the White House. There’s a fire in the Eisenhower Office Building—well there was, but it was just in a garbage can.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We asked for the fighter support. We heard, “You have fast movers at your 7 o’clock.” They were supersonic, F-16s from the president’s guard unit. They led us into Barksdale.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: We’re flying around, all we still have is local TV. The only benefit was that anything broadcasting was broadcasting the attack. Whatever I locked into, it’d only be good until we flew out of range. We were trying to understand from those pictures like anyone else. It was a whole paradigm shift from what I’d thought about conflict and war growing up. It was a new age.\n\nSandy Kress: There was a lot of discussion about who did it. There was nothing anybody knew. But it was lots of talk—and some fear. I remember the plane banking back across the Gulf. We knew there was a change of plans and direction, but something was diverting the plane.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: [Rep. Dan Miller and I] went up to the president’s cabin and he gave us a briefing. He told us that “One way or another” all but a couple planes were accounted for. That was his phrase “one way or another.” He told us Air Force One was headed to Barksdale and was going to drop us off there. When we left the cabin, I turned to Dan and said, “Didn’t you think that was an odd phrase?” He didn’t notice it. I said “‘One way or another,’ that sounds like that there’s more to it than that.” I said, “Do you think there’s any way we shot them down?” We were left hanging.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck, commander, Barksdale Air Force Base, Shreveport, La.: I was the commander of the 8th Air Force. We were in the midst of this big annual exercise called GLOBAL GUARDIAN. They loaded all the bombers, put the submarines out to sea, put the ICBMs at nearly 100 percent. It was routine, you did it every year.\n\nA captain tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Sir, we just had an aircraft hit the World Trade Center.” I started to correct him, saying, “When you have an exercise input you have to start by saying, ‘I have an exercise input.’ That way it doesn’t get confused with the real world.” Then he just pointed me to the TV screens in the command center. You could see smoke pouring out of the building. Like everyone else in aviation that day, I thought, “How in a clear-and-a-million day could someone hit the World Trade Center?”\n\nKaren Hughes: Since I was home, I saw quite a bit of TV coverage just like the American people were seeing it, and I realized that it looked like the American government was faltering. I was on the phone with my chief of staff at the White House when she was told to evacuate. I could actually see the Pentagon burning. But I knew that lots of government was functioning—planes were being grounded, emergency plans were being implemented. I thought someone should be telling the American people that, so I wanted to talk to the president.\n\nWhen I called the operator to try reach Air Force One, the operator came back on the line and said, “Ma’am, we can’t reach Air Force One.” Mary Matalin had passed along that there was a threat against the plane. It was just chilling. For a split second, I was so worried.\n\nGordon Johndroe: I was sitting across the table from Mike Morell in the staff cabin. I asked, “Mike, is something else going to happen?” And he said, “Yes.” That was a real gut punch. We were going to be attacked all day long. There were so many rumors—the State Department, the Mall, the White House.\n\nBrian Montgomery: I asked [Mike Morell] who he thought this was. He said “UBL.” No hesitation. “Who’s UBL?” Those of us not up on the lingo of Langley, we had no idea.\n\nMike Morell: The president called me into his cabin. It was packed with people. The Democratic Front for Liberation of Palestine had issued a claim of responsibility for the attack. The president asked me, “What do you know about these guys?” I explained that they had a long history of terrorism, but this group doesn’t have the capability to do this. Guaranteed.\n\nAs I was leaving, he said to me, “Michael, one more thing. Call George Tenet and tell him that if he finds out anything about who did it, I want to be the first to know. Got that?” I said, “Yes sir.”\n\nSonya Ross: I got the first readout [report] from Ari. The answers we were getting there were pretty incomplete. Ari and his team were giving us the best answers they could. I was nervous. I was thinking—it seems really morbid—but I was thinking, “What if they come after the president? We all turn into ‘and 12 others.’ No one knows your name if you go down with the president. But Eric Washington, he was the CBS sound guy, he had his seat reclined, his feet up. He said, “What are you worried about? You’re on the safest plane in the world.”\n\nAir Force One was the safest and most dangerous place in the world at the same exact time.”\n\nGordon Johndroe: [Air Force One] was the safest and most dangerous place in the world at the exact same time.\n\nKaren Hughes: When I finally did reach Air Force One and spoke with the president, the first thing he said to me was “Don’t you think I need to come back?” He was just champing at the bit to come back. I told him, ‘Yes, as soon as you can.’ Everyone has different roles and I wasn’t thinking about the national security side—I was just thinking about it from a PR perspective.\n\nAndy Card: Mark [Tillman] said, “I don’t care what he says, I’m in charge of the plane.”\n\nDave Wilkinson: The president once told me that the biggest piece of advice he’d gotten from his mother when he became president was always do what the Secret Service says. I reminded him of that several times that day. The president and I knew each other very well—we’d spent a lot of hours at his ranch—and kind of tongue-in-cheek several times that day, I said, “Remember what your mother said.”\n\nAri Fleischer: One of the recurring themes of September 11th is how much of the initial reporting was wrong. I keep that in mind every day now as I watch President Obama and world events. In normal situations, there are many ranks and many filters in government, so that only that which is proven and vital reaches the president. All of that broke down on 9/11. No one in the security apparatus wanted to be negligent in not passing things along. The media was part of that too. All those filters broke down.\n\nAndy Card: The fog of war is real. You can be in a car accident and everyone in the car crash has a different perspective. Take that and multiple that a million times. The first estimates of the casualties were so way off. 10,000 people in New York, 1,000 people at the Pentagon.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: There were so many people coming up to the upper deck, because we weren’t picking up the phones downstairs. It got too crowded. Finally, someone came up and told everyone to get out. The only member of the staff that was up with us was Harriet Miers—she was sitting at one of the CSO seats, with a legal pad taking historical record.\n\nAndy Card: The president’s wondering about his wife, his kids, his parents. Then he’s wondering, is there another city? What’s next? And we’re all thinking, we can’t do anything about it. We’re in a plane, eight miles high in the sky.\n\nDave Wilkinson: We called Mark Rosenker up to the front of the plane and told him to get us on the phone with the commander at Barksdale. He gave us full assurance that the base would be locked down.\n\nAndy Card: I was comforted to find Barksdale was already on alert. It was going to be secure. No random terrorist would have mapped that Barksdale was where the president was going to go. We didn’t have to ring some bell and everyone would run out of the firehouse. Everyone was already out.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: We were already in a practice THREATCON Delta, the highest threat condition. I said lock her down for real. My deputy came in, Lt. Colonel Paul Tibbets—his grandfather was the pilot who flew the Enola Gay [which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima]. He told me that at THREATCON Delta, general officers have to wear sidearms. I tried to refuse, but he insisted. So I was wearing my sidearm, which I never do.\n\nWe got this radio request—Code Alpha—a high priority incoming aircraft. It wanted 150,000 pounds of gas, 40 gallons of coffee, 70 box lunches, and 25 pounds of bananas. It wouldn’t identify itself. It was clearly a big plane. It didn’t take us long to figure out that the Code Alpha was Air Force One.\n\nAnn Compton: We were landing going into Barksdale, Ari came back to the press cabin and said, “This is off the record, but the president is being evacuated.” I said, “You can’t put that off the record. That’s a historic and chilling fact. That has to be on the record.” It was a stunning statement, about the president trying to hold the country together but facing a mortal enemy. The president cannot be found because of his own safety. That sent chills down my spine.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. Barksdale Air Force Base, Shreveport, La.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: Going into Barksdale, there’s this plane that appears. The initial fighters were with us. I still remember the F-16s starting in on this guy. Bearing, range, altitude, distance. You see the F-16 rolls off, they ask, “Hey, who has shoot-down authority?” I say, “You do.” That was a big moment. It turned out just to be a crop duster, some civilian flyer who didn’t get the word.\n\nGordon Johndroe: You cannot hide a blue-and-white 747 that says “United States of America” across the top. You can’t move it secretly through the daylight. Where does local TV go when there’s a national emergency? They go out to their local military base. We’re watching ourselves land on local television. The announcer’s saying, “It appears Air Force One is landing. We don’t have any specific information whether the president was on board, but Air Force One was last seen leaving Sarasota.” The pool is looking at me like, “We can’t report this?”\n\nBrian Montgomery: As soon as we landed, Mark Rosenker [director of the White House Military Office] and I went off the back stairs. There’s this guy who looks like General Buck Turgidson from Dr. Strangelove, big guy, all decked out in a bomber jacket. He was straight out of central casting. We said, “What do you need?” He said, “See those planes? Every one is loaded with nukes—tell me where you want ’em.” We look over and there are just rows of B-52s, wingtip to wingtip. I joked, “Gosh, don’t tell [the president!].”\n\nWe got this radio request—Code Alpha—a high priority incoming aircraft. It wanted 150,000 pounds of gas, 40 gallons of coffee, 70 box lunches and 25 pounds of bananas. It wouldn’t identify itself.”\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Barksdale was going through a nuclear surety inspection. They already had these cops in flak jackets and M-16s. They were all locked and loaded. It’s pretty no-joke when you’re assigned to a nuclear base already. But you still knew that this was going to be different. As soon as we landed, they surrounded the aircraft.\n\nCapt. Cindy Wright, presidential nurse, White House Medical Unit: I remember just how different it was, landing at Barksdale. Everything just had changed in an instant. We’d got off the plane and we were at war.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: When we landed there, looking out towards the flight line, it looked like a war game. You had guys in flak jackets, weapons, heavy equipment and vehicles, guns mounted on top. All facing away from the aircraft.\n\nDave Wilkinson: My biggest concern was the Humvees. Would they be there? We had guys from our local field office rushing over, but they didn’t get there until after. When I saw the four or five Humvees pull up, I had a real sense of relief. One of the other agents raised the concern that the Air Force wanted to drive the president—we [the Secret Service] are normally the only people who drive the president. I said, “That’s the least of our concerns. If the general’s signing off on the guy driving, that’s fine with me. Let’s just let him drive the vehicle.”\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We let the president out through the bottom stairs, because you want that low vantage point in case there’s a sniper.\n\nAri Fleischer: Normally, there’s a whole infrastructure that flies ahead of the president. It’s an armed city, full of Secret Service agents and armored vehicles. But on that day, even the Secret Service is down to just the essential crew aboard the plane. All that was waiting for him in Barksdale was this uparmored Humvee, with room for a standing gunner. The regular Air Force driver, he was nervous and just driving as fast as could be. The president told him to slow down. The president said later he most felt in danger [on 9/11] right there on the runway.\n\nAndy Card: The guy was driving really fast, and in a Humvee the center of gravity isn’t as low as you think. The president said, “Slow down, son, there are no terrorists on this base! You don’t have to kill me now!”\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: I went down to the tarmac to see about having the plane refueled. We could carry 14 hours of fuel. I wanted 14 hours of fuel. I was worried that they weren’t going to have enough fuel trucks, but it turned out we’d happened to park over a hot refueling tank they used for bombers. This civilian is arguing with our crew, “The fuel pits are only authorized for use in time of war.” This Air Force master sergeant—God bless him—overhears this and roars, “We are at war!” He whips out his knife and starts cutting open the cover. That defines to me what the day was like.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: [The president] had landed already and I was on my way to meet him. He was on his way to the conference center. I gave a sharp salute, and his first words to me were, “I guess I put you on the map.” He was really disarming that way. He told me he needed a secure phone to call Governor Pataki, so I took him to my office. As he started making calls, he stopped for a second: “Tell me where I am?” I said, “You’re on the east side of the Red River in Bossier City, Barksdale Air Force base, near Shreveport, Louisiana.”\n\nBrian Montgomery: Once the president got into that private office, Andy Card came out and said this is an opportunity to call your loved ones, but don’t tell them where you are.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: We get to Barksdale, keep in mind that we haven’t really had good TV images. We were all overwhelmed with emotion, because we were all catching up to where everyone else had had a couple hours to process. I called my wife and said, “I’m safe. I can’t tell you where I am.” And she said, “Oh, I thought you were in Barksdale? That’s what I saw on TV.”\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: The horn went off again [at Ellington Field in Houston] and [F-16 pilot Shane Brotherton and I] launched. There was so little information, you had to do things on faith. When we launched, we didn’t even know what the mission was. We were told, \"You need to intercept the Angel flight.\" Well, we had no idea what that meant. We’d never heard Air Force One called that before.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: Andy Card and Karl Rove came into my office with him.\n\nKarl Rove: This is the first point where he gets fully briefed. All three strikes are over, so we know the extent of the damage. His first instinct was to bring together the leaders of government, but everyone had dispersed. It’s just amazing how technology has changed. At the time, the only way to get everyone together was to go to Offutt Air Force Base, the nearest facility that had multiple-site video teleconferencing. Now the president travels with a black Halliburton case that has a screen that can do it through any broadband outlet. It’s amazing.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: I went into the base situation room. I told them I needed to get this guy underground. Where were all the places that I could do that? Offutt was the best choice.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: People forget how much confusion there was that day about what was actually going on. We’d never been attacked like that before, at least since Pearl Harbor. Intel [officers] were coming in all the time. One said that there was a high-speed object moving towards his Texas ranch [in Crawford]. I saw him start thinking about who was at the ranch. It turned out to be a false report.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: I was thinking—I’ve done these Combat Air Patrols over southern Iraq for hundreds of hours, enforcing the no-fly zone, and now I’m doing it over the United States. It was really strange. No one else was airborne. It just felt so serious. We had all this resolve that day.\n\nEllen Eckert: To wait for the president, they took us to the Officers’ Club. I was basically the only person on the trip who smoked cigarettes—or so I thought. While we’re standing there, all of a sudden everyone’s asking for a cigarette. “Wait, you don’t smoke?” Everyone was so whipped up.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: Everyone was busy doing their own thing. The president was looking over the remarks he wanted to give the country. He asked the room, “I use the word ‘resolve’ twice in here—do I want to do that?” No one was answering him, so I said, “I think Americans probably want to hear that.”\n\nBrian Montgomery: We got with someone from the base, and found this rec room or something like that with a bunch of memorabilia on the walls. Gordon and I started rearranging everything—got some flags, found a podium. We knew this was important. Everyone wanted to see the president.\n\nGordon Johndroe: Barksdale was a blur. It was really chaotic. No one really remembers the president’s statement there. It was bad lighting, bad setting, but it was important to have him say something to the nation. That statement is lost to history.\n\nSonya Ross: I dictated a brief report to my colleague Sandra Sobieraj [back in Washington], and then I left my phone on, so she could hear the president’s brief statement. The statement was supposed to be embargoed until we left, so I was trying to curl the phone up under my notebook, so no one would notice it was still on. It gave us a brief head start, because the wire [services], we always need to be first. He said, “Our military at home and around the world is on high alert status. And we have taken the necessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government.” He reiterated that it was a terrorist attack and urged people to be calm. It was very general.\n\nEllen Eckert: I’d never seen the president look so stern. I was lying on the ground at the president’s feet. We didn’t know if the [TV news] feed was working, it was so iffy, so I was there lying down with my mic above my head in case no one else was recording his remarks.\n\nAndy Card: We didn’t want attention to where we were until we left. We videotaped the statement, so that it went out as we left.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: After the press conference, he came back to my office. He hadn’t seen video of the Towers come down yet. He was sitting on my couch and watched the Towers fall. He turned to me, just because I was there, and said, “I don’t know who this is, but we’re gonna find out, and we’re going to go after them, we’re not just going to slap them on the wrist.” I said, “We’re with you.” I knew he meant every word.\n\nAri Fleischer: Andy Card made the decision to chop down the number of passengers. We didn’t know where we were going. We had no infrastructure. We had no motorcade. Anybody non-essential had to be left behind, that included all the congressmen, which they weren’t pleased with. Several White House staffers had to get off. Andy asked if we could take the press down to three. I thought five was the absolute minimum.\n\nSandy Kress: Most of us had stayed on the plane in Barksdale. We were sitting on the runway for a good bit. We were thinking, “Is this a broader attack? Was someone out there looking for us?” It was towards the end of the stop in Barksdale that Brian [Montgomery] came through and told us that we were all staying behind in Louisiana. We understood that the president was continuing on, but that he was not going back to D.C. Our role had been to help him with that trip, and that was over. It made sense.\n\nRep. Adam Putnam: As we’re just waiting on board, supply trucks come up and start unloading food—tray after tray of meat, loaf after loaf of bread, just hundreds of gallons of water. We realize they’re equipping that plane to be in the air for days. It was really unnerving.\n\nGordon Johndroe: We thought at that point that we were not going to Washington for several days. We needed to shrink down our footprint. We didn’t know how many people could be fed, watered, clothed, and supported wherever we were going. It was difficult telling half the press pool that they weren’t coming with us. It was half \"We’re missing the story of our lifetimes,\" and then their personal reaction: \"You’re leaving us in Louisiana and the airspace was shut down.\"\n\nSonya Ross: They herded us out to a blue school bus. Some of us had rumors that they’d shrink the pool. I was thinking I had to fight to get a spot. I didn’t want to have to explain to my boss that I got left behind. I was just going to do my best to get on the plane. Gordon came on the bus. He read off who was going to come with them: AP reporter, AP photographer, TV camera, TV sound, and radio. Everyone else, he said, was going to be left behind. At that point, Judy Keen, the newspaper reporter from USA Today, and Jay Carney, the magazine pooler, they raised a stink. I just scooped up my stuff and ran.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: In the conference room, waiting for the transportation to be squared away, we were sitting around the table, wondering what brought the Towers down. At that point, no one understood that steel melted at such-and-such a temperature. We just couldn’t believe the towers had come down. When it came time to take the president back [to Air Force One], they brought up this Humvee with a .50-cal machine gun mounted on top. I don’t know if he was fearing a Governor Dukakis moment in that tank, but he wanted to ride in a different vehicle. He pointed to our supervisor of flying vehicle. It was a white minivan, which we called “Soccer Mom,” so we drove him out in a minivan.\n\nKarl Rove: As we’re driving back out, [the president] says to me something like, “I know this is a dodge, just they’re going to try to keep me away, but I’m going to let them have this one [and go to Offutt] and then we’re going home. “\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: [As the president’s heading up the stairs] I said to him, “These troops are trained, ready, and they’ll do whatever you want them to.” He said to me, “I know.” We traded salutes. He was on the ground an hour and 53 minutes.\n\nBuzz Buzinski: I saw [the president] walk up the front stairs. You could see how mad he was. You could tell how much emotion he had, the anger inside. As soon as he got on board, it was all business.\n\nSandy Kress: They sent the vice president’s plane down for us, and we eventually boarded it to go back to D.C.\n\nSonya Ross: As we left, they didn’t know how long we’d be gone. They told us that they’d arrange accommodations if we had to be gone a day or two. I told my bureau chief, “I don’t know where we’re going and I don’t know how long I’ll be gone.”\n\nEllen Eckert: Ari told me I was off the plane. The press were not happy, but I was fine—I was thinking, I’m safe here in Louisiana. But then the plane’s fired up, it’s loud, we’re all standing nearby, and Gordon came back to the back stairs, he yells, “Ellen, Ari says get on the plane! He’s changed his mind!” That’s not what I want to do—but then I thought I’m ashamed of myself. Everyone else was getting on that plane. I was the last one on board.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. Airborne, Somewhere Over the Plains\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: We watched Air Force One come up, but we still don’t really know anything. It’s pretty impressive, seeing Air Force One come up in the air.\n\nLt. Gen. Tom Keck: As he takes off, two F-16s pulled up on his wing. That made me think that we were finally getting our act together. I forgot I ever said this, but Kurt Bedke, one of the other officers, told me later that as we watched them fly away I said to him, “Do you feel like you’re in a Tom Clancy novel?”\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: We just started following [Air Force One] north. At some point, I was expecting them to turn east and head to Washington. The longer we’re heading north, the more realize something’s still unsettled. They still don’t feel safe returning to Washington. We only had maps for Texas and Louisiana that day on board. There was no idea that we’d go any further than that. I asked for a tanker to come meet up, and after I hook up, I asked him for every radio channel between here and Canada.\n\nAndy Card: We could finally get some television coverage. You could see the buildings on fire. You saw the replay of the collapse. There were lots of tears. There were lots of quiet moments staring at a TV screen. No conversation. There were prayers. And the fear. It wasn’t even a roller coaster, because we were just in the pits. Oh my god, that’s terrible. And that’s worse. And that’s even worse. All the time, we’re being handed notes, taking telephone calls, giving orders.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: It was an eerie silence on the radio. There’s just no one in the air. We’re just talking among ourselves [the fighter pilots] on our radios. “I wonder if we’re going to Canada?” A lot of, “Man, this is fucked up.” I’m also talking the guys through what happens if we have to shoot someone down. The world’s watching, let’s be by the book and let’s do everything we can to protect the president. You’re going to do everything you can to avoid it, but, as a last resort, if a plane’s going to try to hit Air Force One, I need you guys to think about it. I’m saying, “We’re going to do our best to get them to say ‘you’re approved’ over the radio.”\n\nYou’re going to have think about how you’re saving lives by taking lives. You have to think through that the missiles might not do the job. You may have to employ the gun. Typically our gun sight doesn’t account for a plane that big. We know this would be a plum target, but we also figure no one would expect Air Force One right now to be flying north over Kansas.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: The whole day was eerie. There were no radio calls. Controllers were telling us about suspicious planes—I had no idea there were so many crop dusters in America.\n\nEric Draper: Everyone was starving for information. We couldn’t hear anything unless the plane was flying over a major city.\n\nAri Fleischer: There was no live television. It put us in a very different spot than most Americans that day. People around the world were just riveted to their television sets. We had it intermittently on Air Force One. We had it in Barksdale at the base commander’s office. But there’s no email on Air Force One back then. When you’re in the air, you’re cut off. It was absolutely stunning, standing next to the president as he was talking to the vice president then holding the phone off his ear because it cut off.\n\nEllen Eckert: The plane is like the Twilight Zone. It’s really eerie. There’s just no one on board anymore. The staff cabin is empty, the guest cabin is empty. That’s when it was really coming apart for me. I saw one of the agents was standing in the hallway, and I went up to him, \"So this is the safest place to be? This is Air Force One, right?\" He said, \"Well, listen, don’t mention this, but we might as well have a big red X on the bottom of this plane. We’re the only plane in the sky.\" That was scary. I went into the bathroom and used one of those Air Force One notepads to write a letter to my family—six siblings and two parents. They’re never going to see this, it’s going to burn up in a fiery inferno. One of the flight attendants opened the door and comforted me and gave me a washcloth to wipe. “We’ve got this. We’re all together.”\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: [As we flew to Offutt] some of the commercial systems finally began to become available. One of the phones actually rang, I picked it up, it was my chief: “How are things going?” “Well, chief, we’re a little busy.” None of the crew were allowed to make calls to our families. Everyone was just locked in. It probably actually helped a lot of us get through the day.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: Fifteen minutes after we tanked up, we saw Air Force One start to descend. I did the math and figured out they were probably headed to Offutt. Well, now we had a full tank of gas. You can’t land like that in a small plane, so we were doing afterburner 360s at 7,000-feet to burn off enough gas to land our planes.\n\nMike Morell: On the way from Barksdale to Offutt, the president asked to see me alone—it was just me, him, and Andy Card. He asked me, “Michael, who did this?” I explained that I didn’t have any actual intelligence, so what you’re going to get is my best guess. He was really focused and said, “I understand, get on with it.”\n\nI said that there were two countries capable of carrying out an attack like this, Iran and Iraq. But I believed both would have everything to lose and nothing to gain from the attack. When all was said and done, the trail would lead to UBL. I told him “I’d bet my children’s future on that.”\n\nHe asked when we’d know. I walked him through recent cases—in the [1998] East Africa [Embassy] bombings, it had been a couple days, the [2001] USS Cole [bombing] had taken a couple months, the [1996] Khobar Towers [bombing] it had taken over a year. It may be quick or it may be a long while. The whole time, I didn’t realize the CIA had already figured it out.\n\nWhen I finished, he didn’t say anything, we just sat there. It felt like three, four, five minutes. It was getting awkward. I finally said, “Is there anything else, Mr. President?” He said, “No, Michael, thank you.”\n\n\n\n\n\nV. Offutt Air Force Base\n\nBuzz Buzinski: Landing at Offutt was probably the one funny moment of the day. I’m a big guy—6-foot-4, 270—but Will [Chandler’s] also a huge guy, he’s a 6-3, 250. We always said he’s got hands the size of a TV screen. Well, we’re the first two off the plane. The rear stairs are always down first, you get off and guide the front stairs in. When we get off, underneath the jet are five or six maintainers, who were trying to plug the plane into ground power. No one told us they’d be there—all we see are this group of five guys. Chandler yells: “Clear the area!” He just let out this bellow. Well, it was like cats scattering—they dropped radios, dropped the cable. They’re panicked—there’s this big guy coming at them. It was hysterical. I just laughed.\n\nAdm. Richard Mies, commander, U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Offut Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska: Without knowing whether he was coming to Omaha, we’d taken the initiative to start preparing, working with the 55th Wing, which runs Offutt. We’d started to evacuate the main quarters that could be used for VIPs, and install some of the protection there that’d be needed in case he needed to spend the night.\n\nWe didn’t know that he was coming to Offutt until about 15 minutes before. There wasn’t much communication with Air Force One at all. There wasn’t going to be any pomp and circumstance. I had my driver and a Secret Service agent who we had, and the three of us went out to the runway to greet Air Force One. It was just a plain Chrysler.\n\nDave Wilkinson: By the time we got to STRATCOM, there were like 15 to 20 planes still unaccounted for [nationwide]. People will say it was only six, but there were a lot more than that. For everything we knew, they were all hijacked. But, even as we landed, they started to kick them off quickly.\n\nAdm. Richard Mies: I decided to bring the president down into the command center via the fire escape entrance. That was the most expedient option. I’d never used it before. It was there for emergencies. I had them open it from the inside.\n\nBrian Montgomery: There were a lot of airmen in battle gear lining the route to the bunker. We pull up to this five-story office building, and instead of walking in the front door, the admiral says, “No, we’re going in there.” We head into this concrete building, just a door. We went down and down and down, pretty far underground.\n\nAt left, President George W. Bush arrives Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001, at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. At right, Bush, Admiral Richard Mies, left, and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card conduct a video teleconference at the base. | Courtesy of the George W. Bush Presidential Library\n\nGordon Johndroe: The president went into the bunker. It was chilling. I’m watching [the president] with the press from the motorcade and they go into this building and they’re gone. When we got to Omaha, we were tired. Our energy, the stress had ebbed and flowed. A sadness kicked in when we got to Omaha. We didn’t really have time to reflect before then.\n\nEllen Eckert: When he went into the bunker, wow. That’s still a scene in the movie in my head all these years later. Clearly the only way to go was down. We just stood outside, waiting. We smoked a million cigarettes, all my new chain-smoking friends.\n\nEric Draper: I finally had a chance to call my wife, I said, “Honey, I’m going to be home a little late tonight.” I could hear her laugh through the phone, even as she was crying. She said, “I saw you with the president, so I knew you were OK.”\n\nAdm. Richard Mies: We went directly into the command center. That really caught his attention. All these soldiers, they’re all in battle dress. CNN was prominently displayed—a lot of footage of the two towers. We had four to six TV screens, all energized. I sat him down where I normally sit, and walked him through what he was seeing, so he had an awareness.\n\nAndy Card: It’s right out of a TV movie set—all these flat-screen TVs, all these military people, you can hear the fog of war, all these communications from the FAA and the military. But it’s tough for the military folks—they all want to stand and show respect to the commander in chief, but you can tell they want to sit and do their jobs. Everyone is schizophrenic, half-sitting and half standing, everyone’s moving around. After a few minutes, the president turned to me, “I want to get out of here, I’m making it hard for these people to do their job.”\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: All the rules that fighter pilots spend their lives living by were now out the window. When we landed [at Offut] we got more gas and picked up maps for the rest of the country. There are always maps and approaches for the country in base operations, but all the maps always say, \"Do not remove from base operations.\" We just took all of them and stuffed them in our bag.\n\nColonel Tillman walked into base operations and we finally started to get some information. The president was actually an alumni of our unit in Houston. Colonel Tillman told us, “he feels comfortable with you guys and wants you to continue us.” We told him we’d sit back about five miles—you don’t get that close to something that valuable, for all sorts of reasons—but if something happened, we can eat up that range real quick.\n\nAdm. Richard Mies: The VTC was just the three of us, the operator, and his military aide. There were just five of us at most. There was no real audience. We listened as everyone reported in. Richard Clarke [of the National Security Council], [Transportation Secretary] Norm Mineta, [Deputy Secretary of State] Richard Armitage, [National Security Adviser] Condi [Rice], [CIA Director] George Tenet. Most of the initial conversation in the VTC was focused on who did this. There was a lot of speculation. It was too early to make definitive. Then we were talking about: How do we restore some sense of normalcy quickly, both for New York and for the country? And then how does the president get back to Washington?\n\nMike Morell: When Tenet explained that he had evidence pointing to Al Qaeda, the president turned around and looked at me—his look clearly said, “What the fuck happened here?” You were supposed to tell me first. I tried to explain with my look that I was sorry—I didn’t know how my message had gotten lost. I went to a nearby office and called Tenet’s assistant, angry. I felt like I’d let the president down.\n\nAndy Card: When George Tenet said it was Al Qaeda, it wasn’t like dawn breaking over Marblehead. We all suspected that it was Al Qaeda. I’d thought that since the classroom door. It wasn’t that dramatic of a moment actually. It was just a confirmation. Think of what it would’ve happened if he’d told us that it was Russia, China, or another nation-state? Or an American splinter group?\n\nDave Wilkinson: We felt like we were probably pretty safe and it could be prudent to go back. Everyone went around the room [on the video conference], the vice president kicked it off, and everyone said their piece. Finally, the president said to Brian [Stafford], my boss [the Secret Service director], “Brian, Dave and Eddie are just doing their job and telling me I can’t go back to D.C., but I think it’s time for me to come back.” Brian did a good job—he explained [to the president] that it was a heightened security environment, and we’re were going to relocate you and move you if the slightest thing comes up.\n\nBrian Montgomery: Once we got to Offutt, you would have had to tie him down to keep there overnight.\n\nJulie Ziegenhorn, public affairs officer, Offutt Air Force Base: We were working at our desks and all of a sudden, there was the President striding down the hallway. He walked right out the front door, waving to us. He shouted, “Thanks for all you’re doing!”\n\nGordon Johndroe: We’re there with the pool and our Secret Service agent says, “Oh my gosh, we’ve got to go right now. The president’s leaving.” Ann [Compton] was on with Peter Jennings. I didn’t want to panic her or the nation by making it seem like we were leaving abruptly, but we needed to leave. I mouthed, “We have to go.” She was on the radio and she said, “I’m told we’re leaving. I don’t know where we’re going.” Peter Jennings said, “Godspeed, Annie.”\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: We thought he was going to be there for a while. I was in base operations and someone came in and said, “I think the president’s headed back to the plane.” I said, “Nah.” He said, “No, I’m pretty sure I just saw him drive by.” I started to race back to the plane. He’d already gotten there. He’s waiting at the top of the stairs and told me, “Tillman, we got to get back home. Let’s get back home.”\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: No one told us that Air Force One was leaving, so we’re like, “Oh shit, are they starting up?” We’re racing to get our planes in the air, but it takes some time. We met the minimum safety requirements and hit the air. A 747 configured like that, gosh, that’s a fast airplane. We didn’t want to go supersonic, it’d burn up too much fuel, so we talked to them, and we had to reel them in.\n\n\n\n\n\nVI. Airborne, En route to Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, D.C.\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: I’m doing .94 Mach. The fighters only have so much gas. We went as fast as we could across the United States. F-16s were coming out of D.C. to meet us, everyone was joining up with us. We had F-15s with us too.\n\nMike Morell: On the flight to Andrews, I finally got this packet full of all the intelligence CIA had. It included the talking points that George Tenet had used to brief the president, but there was still a lot he hadn’t been able to say. I shared all those details with the president. The second half of the packet was a set of intelligence passed to us by a European ally explaining that it had detected signs that Al Qaeda was planning a second wave. When I was showing that to the president, I could tell from his reaction, it struck him: “Gosh, this could happen again.” This isn’t over.\n\nAndy Card: When he talked to his dad, his dad reinforced George W. Bush’s desire to get back to Washington. That made me feel a little guilty, but by then we were on our way back.\n\nEric Draper: I asked Andy Card at one point, “Who did this?” “Al Qaeda.” I’d never heard of Al Qaeda before.\n\nAndy Card: By the time we’re coming from STRATCOM, it was kind of skeleton crew aboard. The closer we got to Washington, the more the president wandered.\n\nBrian Montgomery: I found the president at the front of the staff cabin at one point. I just said, “We’re going to hit ’em hard, right, when this is all over?” He just said, “Yes, yes, we are.” I knew that look in his eyes. He was mad.\n\nEllen Eckert: The president came back to the press cabin, I asked him if he was doing OK, and he said yes. I asked, “Have you spoken to Mrs. Bush?” He said, “Yes, she’s fine.” He patted me on the back, twice. Then Doug Mills [the AP photographer] said, “Keep your spirits up.”\n\nThe president said, “We won’t let a thug bring this country down.”\n\nSonya Ross: I was typing away [in the press cabin], working on my notes [when the president came in], and I don’t think he saw me at first. I started typing that quote down, and he heard me typing and turned to me: “Hey, off the record!” He didn’t say anything else.\n\nEllen Eckert: He gave Sonya the stink eye.\n\nGordon Johndroe: There was one time when President Bush slipped back there—I was in the staff cabin with Andy Card and don’t know how he got back there—and he came in and said, “I just spoke with the press.” He saw my face and said quickly, “Don’t worry, it’s OK. It was off the record.” He was trying to be a very calm and comforting presence to everyone.\n\nThe president is consoled by presidential nurse Cindy Wright, of the White House Medical Unit, aboard Air Force One. | Eric Draper/George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\n\nEric Draper: Everyone was trying to take it all in. I took this picture of Cindy Wright, a White House nurse, rubbing the president’s back. At another moment, the president had his arm around Harriet Miers as they walked down the plane.\n\nCapt. Cindy Wright: What’s funny about that picture is I don’t really remember being compassionate or ministering to him—I do remember that he came in to check on me and the team. It was amazing to me that he was walking through the plane checking on us. I was in the medical compartment. It was still fairly new in the administration, so we knew each other from talking and being at the ranch, but that was the first time we hugged—I’m a big hugger, and he is too.\n\nAnn Compton: We were finally able to say on the record—I called my bureau and told them—that the president was heading back to Washington and would address the nation from the Oval Office.\n\nSonya Ross: I had started on the White House beat on September 11th, six years earlier. I said to Ari at some point, “This is my White House anniversary.” He laughed, “Some anniversary party you threw.”\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb: The thing at that moment I was most worried about was a biologic [attack]. In the unlikely but high-risk scenario, I thought there was little harm to be prophylaxing the staff with antibiotics. It seemed like almost science fiction. I gave everyone on the plane a week of Cipro. I hoped by the time they ran out, we’d have figured out the fog of war and know whether we needed to continue measures.\n\nBrian Montgomery: I noticed that Dr. Tubb was walking and talking to each person. He’d lean over and whisper to each person, pat them on the shoulder, and he’d hand over a little envelope, like what the military uses to put pills in. He got to me and said, “Monty”—that was my nickname—“how do you feel?” I said, “Other than the obvious, physically, I feel fine.” “You don’t feel disoriented?” “Nope.” Then he said, “Have you ever heard of Cipro? We don’t know what might’ve been in that school, so we’re just being careful.” I asked him, “What’s it used for?” He told me, “In case it’s anthrax.”\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb: It was scary later realizing later that fall anthrax wasn’t as unimaginable as we’d thought. That was a turning point for our society. I was suddenly real pleased with how we’d reacted on the plane.\n\nAt left, Marine One prepares to land on the South Lawn of the White House.

The president came back into the staff compartment. I was the only one awake. I said, “How are you doing?” “I’m just fine, thanks for asking.” One of the things that struck me, he transformed right before my eyes from a president who was struggling a bit with the direction of his administration on September 10th, to a wartime president, just in a matter of hours. I could already see this new confidence and power in him.\n\nGordon Johndroe: I don’t really remember eating, but the stewards put out some sandwiches and chips. The Air Force bills you for your meals aboard Air Force One, through the White House Military Office. I remember a couple days later getting a bill for $9.18. The bill said for meals on September 11th between Sarasota-Barksdale, Barksdale-Offutt, Offutt-Washington.\n\nMaster Sgt. Dana Lark: I’ve never felt more fatigued. I can’t remember anything as physical as that day. It just sucked everything out of you.\n\nMike Morell: The president’s mil aide [Tom Gould] was looking out the window on the left side of the plane, he motioned me over. “Look.” There was a fighter jet on the wingtip. He told me there was another one on the other side of the plane. In the distance, you could see the still-burning Pentagon. Throughout the day, all this is happening and you don’t really have the chance to feel the emotion. But that got me. Tears filled my eyes for the first time that day.\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: It was really a shock, but I remember thinking that the hole in the building, relative to the whole size of the Pentagon, is relatively small. It was symbolic. It’s a painful wound, but we’re big enough to absorb it.\n\nAndy Card : We kneeled on the benches to look outside, you could see the fighter jets came up pretty close to Air Force One. You just don’t see that on Air Force One.\n\nKarl Rove: I watched the fighters and I realized this was no ceremonial escort—this was the last line of defense in case there was a MANPAD [surface-to-air missile] on the approach to Washington. They were going to put themselves between Air Force One and whatever the threat was.\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb: As we’re coming in on final [approach], Dan Bartlett comes into my office and says, “Thanks, I took all those pills. Anything else I need?” I said, “What?! Absolutely not! That was supposed to be a week’s worth!” I’m flipping through the Physician’s Desk Reference, that huge book, trying to figure out what the toxic level of Cipro is.\n\nBrian Montgomery: [Dan] was real worried for a moment. After all that happened that day, Dan was going to die from Cipro poisoning.\n\nCol. Dr. Richard Tubb: I looked into it and told him, “Listen, you’re going to be fine. You might want to take an antacid.”\n\nCol. Mark Tillman: It was a long day. As we’re landing, I’m thinking, all I’ve got to do is get him on the ground, then I can hand him off to the Marines. I’m watching the fighters scream by underneath, doing suppression, trying to figure out if there was anything waiting for us. The landing itself, after everything, was entirely normal.\n\nGeorge W. Bush meets with his National Security Council in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center of the White House after addressing the nation. | U.S. National Archives\n\nMaj. Scott Crogg: We’d landed right behind Air Force One, so we saluted as Marine One took off. We knew the president was heading to the White House.\n\nAri Fleischer: There are several different routes that Marine One can take back, we took the most scenic, directly over the Capitol, down the Mall, at the Washington Monument, you bank right.\n\nAndy Card: We only flew at tree-top level, zig-zagging, to make it harder for a missile to hit us. We were really low to the water on the Potomac.\n\nAri Fleischer: Out of the front left of the chopper, the president had a clear view of the Pentagon. The president said to nobody and everybody, “The mightiest building in the world is on fire. This is the face of war in the 21st century.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEpilogue\n\nMike Morell: [In 2011], the very first telephone call that President [Barack] Obama made after we were sure we’d killed Osama bin Laden was to President [George W.] Bush. President Obama knew that I’d been with him on 9/11, and so he asked me to fly down to Dallas after the raid to brief President Bush personally. I went down about two weeks later and walked President Bush through every aspect of the raid. I thought I could see in his face some sense of closure.\n\n(Note: All titles and military ranks are presented as people were on September 11, 2001, and interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.)\n\nJournalist Garrett M.

She parked on the fourth floor, instead of the third, where she lived, according to the affidavit, possibly suggesting that she was confused or disoriented.\n\nWhen she put her key in the apartment door, which was unlocked and slightly ajar, it opened, the affidavit said. Inside, the lights were off, and she saw a figure in the darkness that cast a large silhouette across the room, according to the officer's account.\n\nThe officer told police that she concluded her apartment was being burglarized and gave verbal commands to the figure, which ignored them. She then drew her weapon and fired twice, the affidavit said.\n\nShe called 911 and, when asked where she was, returned to the front door to see she was in the wrong unit, according to the affidavit. Authorities have not released the 911 tapes.\n\nThe Dallas County medical examiner's office said Jean died of a gunshot wound to the chest. His death was ruled a homicide. Guyger was arrested Sunday night and booked into jail in neighboring Kaufman County before being released on bond.\n\nAt a news conference Monday evening, Merritt said two independent witnesses have told him they heard knocking on the door in the hallway before the shooting.\n\nHe said one witness reported hearing a woman's voice saying, \"Let me in! Let me in!\" Then they heard gunshots, after which one witness said she heard a man's voice say, \"Oh my God! Why did you do that?\"\n\nMerritt said he believes those were Jean's last words.\n\nAs for the contention that Jean left his front door ajar, Merritt said Jean was a \"meticulous individual\" who made it \"a point to close the door behind him.\"\n\n\"He put everything in a particular place,\" Merritt said.\n\nHe said Jean had a red doormat outside his apartment door. \"In fact, to ensure no one mistook his apartment the way this officer is claiming in this case, he went out and bought the biggest, brightest red rug and placed it right there at his doorstep,\" Merritt said.\n\nMerritt has represented relatives of an unarmed black teenager who was fatally shot in the back by a white police officer in June while fleeing a traffic stop near Pittsburgh.\n\nCrump is best known for representing the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. Martin, 17, was fatally shot in 2012 in Florida by George Zimmerman, a Hispanic man who was a neighborhood watch captain. Brown, 18, was shot to death in 2014 by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\"Black people in America have been killed by police in some of the most unbelievable manners,\" Crump said earlier Monday, citing \"driving while black in our cars\" and \"walking while black in our neighborhoods.\"\n\nNow, he said, \"we are being killed living while black when we are in our apartments.\"\n\nProtesters gathered at police headquarters Monday night in Dallas, The Dallas Morning News reported. Several dozen blocked traffic as they marched about half a mile from the headquarters. Police used pepper-spray devices to help control the crowd at one point.\n\nDallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson emphasized that her office was conducting its own probe, in addition to the investigation by the Texas Rangers. She will have the option of presenting more serious charges to the grand jury.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Guyger had an attorney.\n\nGuyger's blood was drawn at the scene to be tested for alcohol and drugs, Police Chief U. Renee Hall said, but authorities have not released results.\n\nJean grew up in the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia before attending college in Arkansas. He graduated in 2016 from Harding University, where he often led campus religious services as a student. He had worked for accounting firm PwC since graduating.\n\nJean wasn't the first person shot by Guyger. She shot a man named Uvaldo Perez on May 12, 2017, while on duty.\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed against Perez, police were looking for a suspect when Guyger and another officer were called to assist a third officer. Perez got out of a car and became combative with Guyger and another officer. A struggle began and Guyger fired her Taser at Perez, who then wrested it away from her. She then drew her gun and fired, wounding Perez in the abdomen.\n\nSgt. Michael Mata, president of Dallas' largest police union, the Dallas Police Association, said Guyger was a respected officer who worked on a high-risk team tasked with arresting some of the most violent offenders. On the day of the shooting, her unit had arrested multiple suspects for armed robbery, he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Terry Wallace and David Warren in Dallas and Ken Miller in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.", "name": "Attorneys question officer's account of neighbor's shooting", "description": "Attorneys for the family of a black man who was shot and killed by a white Dallas police officer who says she mistook his apartment for hers are criticizing an affidavit that gives a narrative of what happened.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/09/11/attorneys-for-family-criticize-affidavit-in-dallas-shooting.html", "id": "4a6f65e7615e07fb952f66b3f8485d28a74fff95", "keywords": ["shooting", "neighbors", "shot", "officer", "perez", "apartment", "account", "attorneys", "affidavit", "guyger", "jean", "dallas", "merritt", "question", "officers", "door"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

John Hickenlooper and other state officials late Tuesday, reigniting a debate over religious freedoms in the public square.\n\nJack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop claims in his lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver, that the state has renewed its “crusade” against him for refusing to create a cake that would have violated his religious beliefs.\n\nAccording to the suit, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that he once again violated the state’s nondiscrimination law when he refused to bake the cake. This time, it was for Autumn Scardina, an Arvada woman celebrating her birthday and the seventh anniversary of her gender transition.\n\nThe commission’s June opinion came despite Phillips’ earlier win at the U.S. Supreme Court over his refusal to make a cake for a gay wedding, the lawsuit says.\n\n“The state of Colorado is ignoring the message of the U.S. Supreme Court by continuing to single out Jack for punishment and to exhibit hostility toward his religious beliefs,” said Kristen Waggoner, legal vice president of Alliance Defending Freedom, the organization representing Phillips.\n\nHowever, the justices’ 7-2 decision in the cake maker’s earlier case was a narrow ruling that kept the state’s nondiscrimination laws intact but said the state commission did not appropriately weigh Phillips’ religious rights.\n\nHickenlooper told reporters Wednesday that he was not involved the commission’s most recent ruling, but said the issue is one of the most thorny he has seen during his public service career. He said he expects the issue to return to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“The first ruling from the Supreme Court did not address the basic issue,” he said, referring to the religious freedom issue, “and that’s what I think the U.S. Supreme Court will have to address this time.”\n\nThe Civil Rights Commission and attorney general’s office declined to comment Wednesday. Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican, has long been a supporter of the LGBTQ community.\n\nTuesday’s lawsuit reignites years of legal debate over how religious beliefs should be considered under Colorado’s public accommodation law. The 2008 state law forbids businesses from discriminating against customers on a variety of grounds including sexual orientation and gender.\n\nPhillips and his cake shop first made national news in 2012, when he declined to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of his religious objections to same-sex marriage. The years-long legal fight ended at the U.S. Supreme Court this June in a decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy, who has authored a number of landmark rulings expanding gay rights, indicated that the decision was not all-encompassing.\n\nAt the time, observers on both sides of the case said the limited decision meant the broader debate would continue to be litigated.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Scardina, a lawyer, filed a complaint with the commission claiming that the cake shop denied her request for a cake — blue on the outside and pink on the inside to represent her transition.\n\nA store employee declined the request because the custom cake would have expressed messages about sex and gender identity that conflict with Phillips’ religious beliefs, according to Scardina’s complaint with the Civil Rights Commission.\n\n“The woman on the phone did not object to my request for a birthday cake until I told her I was celebrating my transition from male to female,” Scardina wrote in her complaint. “I believe that I was not allowed to order a birthday cake because I requested that its colors celebrate my transition.”\n\nScardina on Wednesday did not return requests to comment.\n\nIn a June 28 decision letter, the commission wrote that there was probable cause to believe Masterpiece violated a state law by denying Scardina “equal enjoyment of a place of public accommodation.” The letter ordered the bakery and Scardina to attempt an amicable resolution by compulsory mediation, according to Phillips’ legal team.\n\nJim Campbell, another lawyer for Phillips, said in a statement that Phillips shouldn’t have to fear government hostility when he opens his shop for business each day.\n\n“We’re asking the court to put a stop to that,” Campbell said. “The arbitrary basis on which the state is applying its law makes clear that its officials are targeting Jack because they despise his religious beliefs and practices.”\n\nOne Colorado, the state’s largest LGBTQ advocacy organization, said the new lawsuit was one of several filed in an effort to legalize discrimination.\n\n“All people — including LGBTQ people — deserve to be served equally in public spaces, and no religious belief gives anyone the right to pick and choose whom they serve and what laws they want to follow,” Daniel Ramos, One Colorado’s executive director, said in a statement. “This is another attempt by the ADF to undermine laws that protect Coloradans in the areas of public accommodations, employment, and housing.”\n\nEarlier this year, the state’s civil rights commission became a political flashpoint during the state’s regular legislative session. Some conservative lawmakers attempted to shut down the commission in part because of its role in the Masterpiece cake controversy.\n\nUltimately, Hickenlooper signed a bipartisan compromise that extended the commission through 2027 and changed the makeup of the commission, requiring it be more bipartisan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the governor denounced discrimination, saying “it’s not what America stands for.” He also stressed that he understood the value of a person’s religion freedom.\n\n“This is a difficult question. When you’re talking about people’s religion, it doesn’t matter what religion, it’s one of the most tightly held American freedoms that we have,” he said. “It’s why millions of people fought and lost their lives.”", "name": "Masterpiece Cakeshop owner sues Hickenlooper, claiming religious persecution despite Supreme Court ruling", "description": "The owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop has sued Colorado Gov.

Rickard Öste, Oatly’s founder, discovered that by combining oats, water and a dash of canola oil, he could make a creamy, naturally sweet, dairy-free and gluten-free milk alternative that happened to go perfectly with just about everything. The rest of Europe caught on fairly quickly and 25 years after Oatly opened its doors, the United States joined the party.\n\n\n\nOat milk mania started to catch on in the U.S. in early 2018. It reached a fever pitch this summer — its ability to produce the perfect dairy-free latte has put it in particularly high demand in coffee shops — and baristas and grocery stores everywhere soon found themselves with an oat milk shortage.\n\nAs Oatly and other oat milk manufacturers scramble to soak, drain and package their oat milk as quickly as possible, the questions arise: What exactly is oat milk, why is it so delicious and is it good for us? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nHere’s why people can’t get enough of oat milk\n\nBy the time non-dairy milks have been mass-produced and splashed on top of our cereal, they’re in pretty good shape. But over the years, it’s taken a lot of trial and error to perfect the process of making soy milk, coconut milk and almond milk with just the right consistency and flavor. It’s also involved a lot of added ingredients, and they’re not always great for us.\n\n\n\nOat milk, on the other hand, is effortlessly tasty: Oats are fibrous and absorb water more easily than nuts do, leading to a naturally creamy consistency. Plus, oats are a little bit sweet, which only adds to oat milk’s deliciousness.\n\n\n\nWhile a handful of companies manufacture oat milk, Oatly is far and away the most popular. D.C.-based nutritionist Lisa Hayim said there’s also something to be said for the marketing around Oatly: It happens to have very cute packaging. “As a nutritionist who gets frustrated by fads and marketing to innocent consumers, this one doesn’t bother me,” said Hayim.\n\nYes, oat milk is also good for you\n\nWhy doesn’t the trendiness of oat milk bother Hayim? Because in addition to tasting great, it’s also packed with nutrition.\n\n\n\n“It’s a great addition to the crowded non-dairy nut milk industry because of its unique nutritional composition,” she explained. “Oat milk is going to bring in very little fat, but a bit of carbohydrate and just a small amount of protein. Some of its carbohydrate makeup comes from fiber, and the specific type of fiber could have cholesterol-lowering effects.”\n\n\n\nPlus, the fact that oats are naturally a little bit sweet makes it so that adding sugar isn’t necessary to make it taste great. That’s a dream for any nutritionist.\n\nAnd you can make it yourself at home, as shown in this video:\n\nCould oat milk be the best dairy milk alternative?\n\nSo what about coconut milk, almond milk and soy milk? Should we ditch them altogether in favor of oat milk? Hayim cautions against that, saying that the different non-dairy milks bring different nutrition profiles to the table.\n\n“It’s not that one is ‘better’ or ‘worse’ but the shift in macronutrient compositions should be considered,” explained Hayim. “Soy milk comes from the soybean, so you’re naturally going to get a decent amount of protein that is similar to regular cow’s milk. Almond milk (or any of the nut milks) come from nuts or seeds which are comprised of mostly fat. Depending on the amount of dilution, you’re likely to see a higher percentage of fat found in almond milk compared to oat milk. Coconut milk is also going to be higher in fat but will contain saturated fat.”\n\nWhile there’s no question that diversity is key nutrition-wise, it’s also worth noting that oat milk may be a more sustainable option than other non-dairy milks. For example, it takes six times more water to grow almonds than oats, according to the Water FootPrint Network. Plus, oat milk is a godsend for people with food allergies: Oats are nut-free and mostly are gluten-free (make sure to check the package, though!).\n\nLike other non-dairy milk, oat milk is sold in the refrigerator aisle and in non-refrigerated boxes. Brands like Elmhurst and Pacific Foods can typically be found in aisles near the boxed soups, while Califia Farms and Oatly are in the refrigerated section near the yogurt and eggs. As a word of warning, boxed non-dairy milks typically have more ingredients in them, but that’s not always the case. Just make sure to be a label detective while you’re picking out your oat milks.", "name": "What Is Oat Milk?

And his supporters often soak up the contradictory claims just as readily as he spits them out, taking it all in stride.\n\nCall it a belt-and-suspenders approach.\n\nWhen it comes to the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 campaign, for instance, Trump has simultaneously claimed that “there was no collusion” with the Russians, but, also, that “collusion is not a crime.”\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

(One could, however, argue that a great memory is one that selectively forgets unhelpful information.)\n\nAnd when it comes to the media, Trump constantly rails against the “fake news media,” branding journalists as “very dishonest people” while continuing to sit with journalists in the Oval Office and even praise some of his favorite punching bags mid-swing. A day after refusing to call on CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta at a news conference in England and bragging about his “takedown,” Trump last July, for instance, tweeted that Acosta was “actually a nice guy.”\n\nFormer Trump aides Gary Cohn Rob Porter are targets of the president’s ire for “leaking” to veteran reporter Bob Woodward. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo\n\nPeople who have interacted with Trump over the years said he can sell two opposing viewpoints because he doesn’t see them as such.\n\nWhen it comes to the Woodward book, in particular, “he has to call it fiction because it criticizes him, that piece is just a given,” said Jack O’Donnell, a former president and chief operating officer of the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City, who has since become a critic of his former boss. “He also loves attacking people. He’s comfortable when he’s doing that. As a tack, he doesn’t associate the two. He can say the book is fiction and then go out and attack individuals he thinks spoke to Woodward.”\n\nO’Donnell said it’s part of a classic Trump playbook. “The same person can be a good guy and a bad guy,” he said. “He does that regularly. He changes every five minutes because it’s all about the attention span, and who is the last person he spoke to, and what light does it put him in in any given moment. That’s what can change his whole approach.”\n\nOther longtime associates said in the case of the Woodward book, Trump would be better off changing tack completely: embracing the narrative whole hog, rather than trying to discredit it on multiple fronts at once.\n\n\"Trump is level-headed. It's the other guy who is taking the stuff off of his desk,” said Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, referring to a scene in the book where Cohn steals a letter off of the Resolute Desk to prevent Trump from withdrawing from a trade agreement with South Korea. \"My strong recommendation is Trump buys 1 million copies and carpet bombs them into every congressional district in dispute and he will win them all.\"\n\nBannon said Trump should stop bashing both the author and his former aides, because in his view the book demonstrates that Trump stayed the course, even beset by a set of advisers misleading him -- and that Trump, alone, understood how national security and trade deals are linked. “If he acts like a 5-year-old,” said Bannon, “I want more 5-year-olds on the National Security Council.”\n\nAnother former adviser said most of Trump’s anger is likely driven by the fact that he never had the opportunity to sit down with Woodward, despite the author’s repeated requests for an interview.\n\nBut even when it comes to whether or not Trump knew about the interview request, he appeared to want to bet on both sides of the coin: he claimed he didn’t know anything about Woodward’s attempts to reach him, while also admitting in the same conversation that “Sen. Graham actually mentioned it quickly in one meeting.\"\n\n“He has always spoken highly of Woodward over the years,” said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser. “He reveres these people. He would have loved to participate in this book.

Democrats have nominated a whopping 180 female candidates in House primaries — shattering the party’s previous record of 120, according to Rutgers’ Center for American Women and Politics. Heading into the final primaries of 2018 this week, Democrats have also nominated at least 133 people of color and 158 first-time candidates to run for the House.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe numbers are even starker in the districts without Democratic incumbents. In the 125 districts where a Democratic incumbent is leaving office or a Republican seat is at risk of flipping, according to POLITICO’s race ratings, more than half the nominees (65) are women. An overlapping group of 30 Democratic primary winners are people of color, and 73 of them have never run for elected office before, tapping into voter disdain for politics as usual.\n\nTheir success in primaries could herald a major shift in Congress, which is majority-white, majority-male and still mostly made up of former state legislators who climbed the political ladder to Washington. And the candidates could also mark the beginning of a new era for the rebuilding Democratic Party, which is counting on new types of candidates to take back the House.\n\n“These grass-roots candidates came out of non-political, non-traditional networks, meaning that they’re running very different kinds of campaigns than we’ve ever seen,” said Martha McKenna, a Democratic consultant who once led EMILY’s List, the pro-abortion rights group. “When a state legislator runs for Congress, that’s a formula we know. But when a nurse or a mom or a young veteran decides to run, their campaign looks and feels different, and in 2018, there’s a lot of power in that.”\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n“The way these new candidates will govern will also be different from what we’ve ever seen before,” McKenna added.\n\n(See POLITICO’s “Women Rule” Candidate Tracker.)\n\nRepublican women could also make history in a handful of House districts, though the GOP's 52 female nominees are dwarfed by Democrats' totals. In California, former state legislator Young Kim would be the first Korean-American woman to serve in Congress if she can hold a tough open seat for the GOP, while Lea Marquez Peterson, president of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, would be the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress.\n\nBut it was the Democrats' new wave of candidates that pulled some of the most stunning upsets of the primary season — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, both women of color, knocked off a pair of 10-term white congressmen in the Northeast: Reps. Joe Crowley of New York and Mike Capuano of Massachusetts.\n\nThey have also come out of nowhere to galvanize liberal activists with their personal stories and make some longtime Republican districts competitive by force of personality.\n\nAmy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who had never run for office before, defeated a fixture of Kentucky Democratic politics in a primary and is now threatening GOP Rep. Andy Barr in a conservative district. MJ Hegar, a fellow female veteran from Texas, also raised millions of dollars online after producing a viral Web video on her compelling life story, potentially dragging Rep. John Carter (R-Texas) into his first-ever tough race in his current district.\n\nHundreds of women signed up to run for office in 2017, but the results out of the early primary contests in Texas last spring signaled to national operatives that, “‘Oh, wow, this is sticking, and something has actually changed,’ we all were suddenly saying to each other after the first couple of primaries,” said Delacey Skinner, a Democratic consultant.\n\nNow, fully half of the Democrats on the House ballot in Texas are women, while Colin Allred, an African-American former pro football player, beat out million-dollar Democratic primary opponents to take on Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) in what could be the state’s top battleground district.\n\n“When you look at this large class of women candidates, it’s obvious, it’s no longer your average white guy in a red tie running,” said John Lapp, a Democratic consultant who led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006. “These candidates look and sound different from what we know Congress to be right now, so they start with credibility of being outside of that.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, an outspoken democratic socialist, came to personify the ideological lines dividing the Democratic Party in 2018. But nationwide, the diverse array of candidates coming out of Democratic primaries had an equally diverse range of views on popular liberal policies currently animating the left, like “Medicare-for-all“ and abolishing U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.\n\nFormer Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a moderate Democrat, won a hard-fought primary battle in Arizona, even after she was booed at a candidate forum for calling for reforms to ICE, rather than abolishment. Meanwhile, Kara Eastman, a first-time candidate and social worker, beat former Blue Dog Democratic Rep. Brad Ashford in Nebraska after running an unapologetically liberal campaign. Ashford, a former state legislator and one-term congressman, had the backing of the Washington establishment, including the DCCC, but Eastman said she was buoyed by the “momentum for candidates who want to represent real people.”\n\n“If you think about the reasons for why someone may have voted for Trump, they were looking for someone who’s going to get into Washington and break up the system,” Eastman said. “I represent some of that as a political outsider who’s new to this, running to fundamentally change the system.”\n\nTom Steyer, a billionaire Democratic megadonor and potential 2020 presidential candidate, acknowledged that “there’s a lot of cacophony,” around the Democratic Party’s direction, “but it’s democracy, and it means that people are going to be able to get a chance to listen and make up their minds,” he said.\n\nOne more major House primary remains for Democrats, pitting Maura Sullivan, a veteran and first-time candidate who worked in the Obama administration, against Chris Pappas, an openly gay member of the state executive council. Both are fairly mainstream, conventional Democrats, and while a handful of progressives in the race to replace retiring Rep. Carol Shea-Porter have gone to their left, the battle between the frontrunners has boiled down to biography and resources more than ideology.\n\nSullivan, a 38-year-old former Marine, emphasized in her ads and in an interview with POLITICO that she’s “a part of a group of women veterans running, and I think we approach service and the job differently because we come with a focus on the mission,” she said.\n\nEMILY’s List President Stephanie Schriock called Sullivan “the right candidate for this critical moment,” but Sullivan can’t put away questions about her residency. She moved to the area in June 2017 and acknowledged that she was asked in 2017 to consider running for Congress in Illinois or Virginia.\n\nPappas, in contrast, has focused on his local roots, touting his endorsements from both New Hampshire senators and arguing that Democrats across the country must “find our way forward from the local level up, so that requires a ground up operation … that’s how we retake the House,” Pappas said. “We shouldn’t be waiting for something to fall out of Washington D.C. to know what we should be talking about [in our districts].”\n\nRepublicans have seized on many of these first-time candidates, hoping to personally disqualify them this fall. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the flagship GOP House super PAC, rolled out more than a dozen TV ads in recent weeks, detailing everything from arrest records to sexual harassment allegations against the wave of new candidates.\n\nBut some Republican strategists acknowledged that the unprecedented number of female candidates could put the GOP further on defense in the general election.\n\nFemale candidates attract female suburban voters, “who are not trending toward us right now,” said Mike Noble, a Republican consultant based in Arizona. “Those suburban women are a key bloc that we’re tracking, and they’re not big fans of Trump.”", "name": "‘Something has actually changed’: Women, minorities, first-time candidates drive Democratic House hopes", "description": "White men are in the minority among Democratic House nominees.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/11/white-men-democratic-house-candidates-813717", "id": "943eecac2ac5c89c0efa34de7b04f36c9fb3001c", "keywords": ["women", "democratic", "hopes", "primary", "candidate", "actually", "changed", "running", "democrats", "rep", "firsttime", "house", "candidates", "drive", "minorities", "primaries"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

When “national security” shows up in the pages of leftist political publications at all, it’s usually as an object of criticism. Yet, were the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party to take over Washington—Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for one, seems to be burnishing her foreign policy credentials—the burden of national security would be on their shoulders. Which is why it’s important to acknowledge that ideological friction between progressivism and national security is not inevitable and these phrases need not be contradictions in terms. In recent months, even voices on the left have started to decry the absence of “the left wing’s foreign policy agenda” and acknowledge that progressives are historically far more comfortable advocating for social and economic justice at home than they are litigating what that should mean for U.S. conduct abroad.\n\nBut the argument that the left is totally silent on foreign policy simply isn’t true. Georgetown University’s Daniel Nexon recently proposed that “corporate power, concentrated wealth, environmental dangers, corruption” are threats that should galvanize a leftist foreign policy today. And as Princeton University scholar and longtime co-editor of the leftist Dissent magazine Michael Walzer has observed, the left’s common pursuit of social justice, economic equality and cultural pluralism at home extends to the global stage, in principle.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPeople on the left routinely oppose unilateral wars of choice, like Iraq in 2003, Syria in 2013, and the North Korean near-miss in 2017. A principled humanitarian argument for military intervention could’ve been made in the Syria case, and yet it was the left that most vocally agitated against any kind of involvement there because they saw it as an elective war. They advocate multilateral solutions to transnational problems like climate change and anti-corruption. Indeed, they believe environmental degradation and international corruption are major foreign policy concerns, a mild contrast with mainstream Democrats and a wild contrast with the Trump administration. And they support protecting human rights in countries with long-disenfranchised or oppressed populations. As the Bush and Clinton administrations chose to make China an economic partner in the 1990s, it was the left that marched in the street, supported sanctions on China and passed around “Free Tibet” stickers. Theirs is a moralistic, values-oriented foreign policy whether at home or abroad.\n\nThe problem, then, isn’t that the left lacks any foreign policy positions. Rather, it’s that those positions are sometimes in tension with one another and tell us little about progressive thinking when it comes to a security agenda even when they aren’t in tension.\n\nDifferent from Neoliberalism How?\n\nOne of the problems with the left’s principled foreign policy positions is that they resemble something the left has spent a lifetime rallying against: neoliberalism. For the left, the term “neoliberalism” has often had a pejorative association with capitalist empire; a ruling class controlling the global means of production while the rest of us take out loans for our avocado toast. Yet neoliberal foreign policy—especially as understood in the field of international relations—reflects a commitment to democracy promotion, human rights, economic interdependence, multilateralism over unilateralism, the primacy of upholding international commitments and the legitimacy of international institutions like the United Nations. In other words, a neoliberal foreign policy looks strikingly similar to what the left repeatedly advocates. It should thus be unsurprising that some neoliberals are of the political left.\n\nThere is one major difference: Neoliberals and the left have usually parted ways when it comes to prioritizing what I would characterize as process versus outcomes in foreign policy. Neoliberalism’s logic is one of process in the sense that certain types of conduct abroad over time produce a certain type of world. The earliest conviction of neoliberalism was the necessity of ensuring the free flow of commodities and capital across borders. That first principle eventually necessitated both the acknowledgment of some degree of protections for individual rights (ironically, human beings are capital too) and the legitimacy of international law—specifically the need to respect and enforce international contracts. Credible contracting, in turn, has meant sustaining the principle of international commitments. Some contracts, such as treaties promising to protect select U.S. allies, require the possibility of using force abroad in the name of enforcing American promises. The belief is that such commitments, when credible, actually prevent the aggression that might force the United States to make good on them. Thus, the sales pitch for neoliberal foreign policy is that its mutually reinforcing package of ideas—free markets, interdependence, democracy, human rights and institutions—encourages international cooperation, discourages conflict and promotes a shared sense of justice among nations, especially in the form of a rising economic tide that lifts all boats (global aggregate economic development). This was the logic behind postwar institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and, eventually, the World Trade Organization.\n\nFor certain segments of the left, however, transborder capitalism—which is only one part of the neoliberal bargain but the part on which the left has transfixed for decades—has produced unacceptable social and political outcomes in the form of stunted economic development, eroded sovereign control over national economies, displaced low-skilled workers and even spawned political corruption. These undesirable occurrences derive from the neoliberal tendency to treat an interconnected world economy as sacrosanct and the uneven distribution of wealth across the world as trivial or a necessary evil. The left likes that interdependence potentially inhibits conflict, that human rights have gone legitimately mainstream and that democracy has spread—all outcomes that have occurred thanks in part to (not despite) neoliberalism’s 20th century prominence. But at least some leftists loathe the idea that capitalism might have played a necessary role in producing these outcomes.\n\nThe left isn’t wrong to see a certain unfairness in the Reagan-Thatcher economic vision as applied to the Global South, or in the way the World Bank and IMF forced developing nations to relinquish economic sovereignty. There is both a logic and a moral imperative to treating extreme global inequality as a problem to be addressed through foreign policy. But emphasizing outcomes has led the left to adopt positions that don’t emanate from a clear theory of how means and ends are supposed to relate. How do you get to the just outcomes you prize? A focus on the content of ends leaves unanswered the question of means. This is where a coherent international agenda would be invaluable.\n\nThe world too easily throws progressive preferences into obvious conflict. Are you, for instance, willing to undo the strategic benefits of economic interdependence (such as the absence of great-power wars) if it more fairly redistributes the benefits of the global economy? Facing ethnic cleansing campaigns or genocides, what will staunch a rising civilian body count except for the threat or use of military force? It’s not that other parts of the political spectrum have questions like these figured out and the left doesn’t. It’s just that the left hasn’t grappled with these questions from a position of power and constrained resources, and there’s a strand of pacifism on the left that would not actually acknowledge the utility of force, even in instances where it would spare the mass slaughter of the innocent. A positive foreign policy agenda requires a statement of positive action—not just what you oppose, but what you stand for and intend to do.\n\nNo Theory of Security\n\nThere’s a second problem with progressive foreign policy preferences to the extent we can draw them out: None of it amounts to a statement about the hard choices involved in national security affairs. Put another way, the most identifiable tropes of leftist foreign policy tell us little about the kinds of foreign policy decisions the United States needs to make in order to secure itself in a tumultuous world.\n\nIt’s easy to say that trillions of dollars spent on defense should be diverted to health care and education, or that we should avoid ending up in another Vietnam quagmire. But if given the congressional power of the purse or the policy levers of the executive, what will the left decide on national security, even in broad strokes? The list of issues is long, but there are a few clusters of decisions on defense and geopolitics that would reveal much about whether the trajectory of the left ultimately skews toward the radical or the pragmatic.\n\nOn national defense:\n\nMilitaries can’t be built on-demand to meet the threats of the day. They have to be built in expectation of future challenges. What should the size and shape of the U.S. military be? What roles and missions does it need to be prepared to handle? What geopolitical risks is the left willing to accept by shrinking the military? What are the criteria for shrinkage? And how, if at all, should U.S. forces be globally distributed? Even if an empowered left believes the use of force should only take place within multilateral coalitions officially sanctioned by the United Nations, that has implications for force structure. A defense budget still has to be submitted to reflect that kind of mission set.\n\nOn nuclear disarmament:\n\nNuclear abolition has been a longtime passion project of the left. But would they seek rapid and unilateral nuclear disarmament whatever the existential vulnerabilities it might pose to the United States? An empowered left would doubtless pursue an arms control agenda with other nuclear powers, but 1) that’s a more modest pursuit than the utopianism of full disarmament, and 2) with rivals like Russia and rogues like North Korea, mutual threat reduction measures will only take you so far. President Barack Obama’s position embodied progressive leaning pragmatism—promoting a vision of a world without nukes and seeking out arms control negotiations where possible, but in practice acknowledging that some level of nuclear weapons both maintain deterrence between nuclear rivals and helps prevent allies like South Korea and Japan from going nuclear themselves. Could the left get on board with that?\n\nOn international order:\n\nRussia and China both seek spheres of influence that would override the formal sovereignty of their neighbors. If they had their way, and to some extent they currently do, they’d exercise exclusionary control over the foreign and economies policies of the smaller states along their geographic peripheries. This was the dominant mode of international diplomacy in the age of empires during the 19th century—great powers treating smaller powers like commodities to be swapped and hoarded. The current international system, built around institutions like the United Nations and an alphabet soup of treaties and regimes, formally recognizes the sovereign equality of states. In practice, of course, even the United States has frequently violated that principle of sovereign equality. But permitting Russia and China to do the same now would perpetuate one of the travesties of injustice that the left has railed against going back as far as Mark Twain—national self-determination for the powerful only.\n\nSo when assertive great powers erode the independence of smaller states—whether through predatory economics or hybrid warfare—will the left prioritize cooperation among the great powers for the sake of stability at the expense of smaller states’ preferences? Will the left enter defense cooperation arrangements that attempt to balance and inhibit assertions of influence by other great powers? Or will they staunchly defend the principle of sovereign equality among states, which at a certain point starts to resemble (ironically) neoconservatism? Senator Bernie Sanders used his only foreign policy speech in 2017 to simultaneously take issue with international financial institutions while still endorsing the liberal international order more broadly. Seeing the strategic bets of neoliberalism as something worth reforming rather than junking entirely, as President Donald Trump seems to have decided, implies not just pragmatism, but that Sanders sees some merit in the bets of the past.\n\nOn authoritarianism and democracy:\n\nIt’s one thing to say America won’t help overthrow democratically elected governments—as in did in Chile in 1973, for instance—or that it will no longer impose democracy on others through the barrel of a gun. But what kind of relationships will a progressive government cultivate with the growing number of dictatorships around the world? There are already laws in place preventing foreign military assistance to individuals known or suspected of human rights abuses, but what about foreign military sales to illiberal governments like Pakistan and Egypt? Or development assistance to countries at risk of being coopted by China, like the Philippines (still technically a U.S. ally) or the many vulnerable Pacific Island nations? For the sake of the China market, will the left make the same implicit deal as past presidential administrations—circumscribing a relationship with democratic Taiwan in various ways so that the United States can maintain a functional and profitable relationship with authoritarian China?\n\nPerhaps most important in the digital age, how will the left choose to regulate Silicon Valley’s Big Tech collaborations with dictatorships abroad that would use the technology of American companies to systematically oppress their own populations? Right now China is courting Facebook and Google even as reports emerge that it runs an oppressive surveillance state against its minority Uighur population and is developing a technology-based social credit system (yes, like the one in Black Mirror). The most prominent voices on the left speak out against large multinationals as a general proposition, but have said little about the specific issue of American technology going to work for neo-Orwellianism in China.\n\nProgressive views on foreign policy don’t leave many hints about how the left would answer important questions on national security like those posed above. This is a shame because America’s longstanding consensus in favor of liberal internationalism has been fractured, and nothing has replaced it. What’s more, there’s much within a liberal internationalist agenda that the left would probably like to salvage if it invested the intellectual effort in construction as much as it has criticism.\n\nThere’s an opportunity to articulate a moral foreign policy that nevertheless rejects neoconservatism; that promotes a fidelity to international order without robbing developing-world economies; that takes international commitments seriously without being the world’s police; that probes for opportunities to collaborate with great power competitors without turning a blind eye to their aggression against smaller states; and that balances the harm it sees in the wanton use of American power abroad with a recognition of the positive role it plays.\n\nThe left is more than capable of a principled national security agenda that actually does make America safer. But it requires eschewing old antagonisms and taking national security seriously, reckoning the left’s moral convictions and the outcomes they seek with the world as it is.\n\nVan Jackson is senior lecturer in international relations at Victoria University of Wellington, and global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.

Had the decision to publish the op-ed come to him, Woodward told CBS News, he “wouldn’t have used it. ”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNor is Woodward alone. Baltimore Sun media critic David Zurawik agrees with Woodward . Without the author’s identity being made public, Zurawik notes, the “op-ed massively adds to the cesspool of confusion about the most important story in American life right now.” And Nate Silver, editor of FiveThirtyEight, tweeted that though “it’s a complicated case” his “view is that this [op-ed] was too hot/complicated/important for an op-ed and should have been turned over to the newsroom to handle.”\n\nIt all adds up to a growing consensus among journalists and critics that the Times made a mistake in publishing this anonymously. This consensus is simply wrong.\n\nTo have insisted that the publication carry the author’s name, or to have rejected the piece entirely rather than grant anonymity, would have deprived the American people of directly communicated information from inside the White House. We need to remember: This is a firsthand report, spoken directly to the American citizenry, by somebody in a position of responsibility. It was largely unmediated—opinion editor James Dao has said the op-ed arrived in good shape, suggesting it wasn’t heavily edited—and anonymity guaranteed not only its publication, but its candor.\n\nIt was unlike anything we’ve seen so far, but not because of the information delivered. A profusion of news articles and television reports have described President Donald Trump’s behavior behind closed doors. Had this author simply handed their information to a Times newsroom reporter—as Silver would have it—this piece would have had little news value. In that sense, the critics are right that it doesn’t reveal much we didn’t already know.\n\nYet this essay is both qualitatively and descriptively different from anything we’ve seen yet in the Trump era, and that’s because its power, vitality and relevance emerge from its direct address. Focusing on the motives of the author, or the essay’s news value, is a mistake. In other words, it’s the medium, not the message. And to understand why this might be the most significant and consequential op-ed ever published, we need to think about why the page was invented and what purpose it was designed to serve.\n\nThe op-ed page, and the op-ed essay, were originally conceived by John B. Oakes, the editorial page editor of the New York Times. As early as 1956, Oakes wanted to start a new feature. The idea was simple: The Times would publish outside voices, in short, readable, and persuasive essays, on the page opposite its editorial page. It wasn’t entirely innovative—the old New York World ran an “Op. Ed.” page in the 1920s. But that page, supervised by legendary Editor Herbert Bayard Swope, was filled with regular house columnists like Heywood Broun, Alexander Woollcott and Franklin P. Adams. Oakes’ version would primarily publish outside contributions, and it would be designed to diversify—and even challenge—the institutional opinions presented under the Times’ own aegis.\n\nAmazingly, it would take almost 15 years for this innovation to come to fruition. Delayed by infighting, managerial incompetence and other factors having little to do with journalism, the first iteration of the Times’ op-ed page wouldn’t be published until 1970. By then Oakes’ original idea had been transformed. Within the newspaper, a working group convened in the late 1960s eventually settled on the formula that we recognize today: The page would feature provocative artwork, as selected by Lou Silverstein, the newspaper’s art director. It would host columns by both regular columnists and reporters (which had already begun appearing under the title “Topics of the Times”). It would have essays by outside contributors, offering information and insights unavailable elsewhere in the newspaper. And, because it would replace the lucrative obituary page, a quarter of the page would be reserved for a premium advertisement.\n\nWhen it premiered, nobody really knew the precise definition of an op-ed essay. Assistant Editor Herbert Mitgang was tasked with explaining it to putative authors. “These essays run 700 words,” Mitgang explained to the novelist Walker Percy, “and appear opposite the editorial page of the Times. The most successful pieces have been highly individualistic, opinionated, and pungent ... You will not get arrested if the piece is also witty.” But not everyone grasped the format’s essence. Mitgang exchanged ideas with Noam Chomsky, who did not take kindly to the editing process before finally abandoning the effort. “For some reason, I find it enormously more difficult to write 700 words than 7,000—a typical professorial defect, I suppose,” Chomsky wrote apologetically.\n\nFrom its inception, the op-ed page solicited the majority of its pieces. That’s a little secret that remains true to this day—the Times rejects the vast majority of submissions. “You just couldn’t get really good pieces and good bylines unless you dreamed them up yourself, so we solicited pieces,” Mitgang recalled. The pieces that came in—from both people asked to contribute and complete outsiders—were then edited and published. From the start, Oakes, editor Harrison Salisbury and Mitgang believed the audience wouldn’t confuse publication with endorsement. One surviving list of solicitation ideas (preserved in Salisbury’s papers at Columbia University) includes the prospects of asking Gus Hall of the Communist Party USA to explain “U.S. Communist priorities these days,” and having Robert Welch answer the question: “The John Birchers are flourishing, yes?” The editors knew the motivations of these contributors would be easily decodable to readers.\n\nTo the surprise of everyone save for perhaps Oakes, the page proved an immediate and resounding success. In its first six months, it earned a net profit of $112,000 on $264,900 of revenue. Even more surprising was that this success occurred in the context of a recessionary retrenchment, in which the overall operating income of the Times fell from $10.2 million to $6.8 million. As I’ve detailed elsewhere, the innovative feature’s combination of public service and remarkable profitability inspired newspapers across America to install their own versions.\n\nToday, we take the op-ed page, and the essays that fill it, for granted. It’s our familiarity with the forum that makes each of us an expert on what should—and shouldn’t—be published. Yet there’s no question that the journalists who originally conceived and developed the op-ed page – Oakes, Salisbury and Mitgang—would celebrate its current incarnation. Their innovation was designed specifically to give Times readers an opportunity to adjudge for themselves the value of unmediated communication that’s unique in the newspaper.\n\nCritics argue that by not forcing the author to identify her, or himself, the Times has made that process more difficult. That may be true. But when the Constitution was being debated in the United States, the Federalist papers weren’t shelved because nobody knew who “Publius” was. Rather, readers judged the case on the words, not the identification or motivations of the authors. There’s a long history of anonymity and pseudonymity in American journalism, and it exists for good reasons. That seems to be largely forgotten here.\n\nFinally, we all seem to be forgetting that newspapers exist to print news and information, not hide it from the public. Had this “senior official” come forward and the Times rejected the publication of the essay without identification, it would have committed journalistic malpractice. Think of all the instances when the Times withheld reports that contained vital information for the citizenry. It could have published the news of the Bay of Pigs invasion and possibly canceled that misadventure, and we’ll never know what impact the National Security Agency spying revelations the Times delayed in publishing would have had on the 2004 election.\n\nWe’re all better off with more unmediated perspectives from within the administration. If anonymity is the only way to obtain these, then it’s worth the trade-off. Only after publication can we debate the motivations behind the piece—as we all should.\n\nThat’s right: Had the Times not published the anonymous op-ed, we never would have been able to have this debate. That, in itself, vindicated publication—and redeems the vision of John B. Oakes.\n\nMichael J.

Leonard Lance of New Jersey, who opposed the first bill, said Friday on CNBC.\n\nTop House leaders will unveil the second tax overhaul bill this week.

The Senate is not expected to take up the bill in 2018 given the focus on speeding through judicial nominations and a Supreme Court confirmation — and because Majority Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) simply does not have the votes to pass a second tax bill.\n\nRepublican leaders “certainly directed us from the get-go to be ready to move this in September,” Brady told reporters last week. “It’s full steam ahead.”\n\nGOP officials have long acknowledged that they couldn’t pack all of their priorities into a measure that eventually become last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, because no Democrats supported the bill. They passed it with a slim margin of votes using a budgetary measure called reconciliation, which required only a simple majority in the Senate, and have long wanted to revisit the bill’s tweaks to the individual side of the tax code. Those changes are scheduled to expire after 2025, while the corporate tax changes became permanent under the new law.\n\nThis time, the White House and Treasury Department largely have taken a back seat in drafting the bill, though Brady, President Donald Trump, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have remained in close touch as the bill progressed. Ways and Means lawmakers also visited the White House in July to discuss the bill, and the committee is expected to mark up the new measure on Thursday after releasing legislative text early this week.\n\nThe White House’s main concern is that the individual tax cuts are made permanent, said one Republican close to the White House, calling the other proposals more “nickel-and-dime” stuff. Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump also have visited Capitol Hill to discuss various parts of the bill, according to one administration official.\n\nShahira Knight, the relatively new White House director of legislative affairs, who helped write the Republicans' first tax bill in close concert with top economic staffers and lawmakers, will help shepherd this 2.0 bill through the House, in addition to tackling the farm and multiple spending bills. Since the first tax bill passed, one of Trump’s top informal economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, has become director of the National Economic Council, putting into the White House a firm champion of cutting taxes to spur economic growth.\n\nSome administration officials have expressed regret about the way the individual side of the tax code turned out under the Republican tax bill. “The part of tax reform to me that was so important was really the corporate side,” said Gary Cohn, the White House’s former top economic adviser, at a Washington event in June. “One thing that haunts me,” however, is that Republicans were not able to make the individual income-tax cuts permanent, he said.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the amount of stock buybacks that have followed the tax law and maintain the law has done little to help the average worker, and they are likely to pound those themes again when discussing the second bill.\n\nDemocrats might have run from that fight in the past, given how often Republicans label them tax hikers. But these days, they are more than happy to relitigate last year’s tax law, which they have insisted from the start would heap savings onto corporations and the wealthy while leaving behind the middle class.\n\nThe more even ground on taxes shows up in polling, too. The new tax law has not been the political plus that many Republicans expected as they try to hold on to the House, only becoming less popular since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe House Republican preview of the new bill also floated a range of new tools for families to increase savings, including creating a new Universal Savings Account and making it easier to contribute to Individual Retirement Accounts.\n\nLawmakers and aides in both parties say it’s possible that retirement provisions could pass as part of a year-end tax deal after the election. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel’s top Democrat, previously have teamed up on bipartisan retirement savings legislation.\n\n“My feeling is that it’s fine. It is certainly smart to make the tax cuts permanent, but it is not urgent, because those don’t expire for many years,” said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and informal economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign. “I would still support the bill because it is probably a good thing for Republicans to always be on the offensive on cutting taxes.”\n\n", "name": "At-risk House Republicans say no to new tax bill", "description": "The White House and GOP House leaders are pushing a second tax reform before the midterms.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/09/house-republicans-tax-bill-trump-midterms-811255", "id": "a4f141130c47647e8d1c8b026c5a134fc8703436", "keywords": ["tax", "white", "bill", "individual", "atrisk", "second", "say", "republican", "economic", "permanent", "house", "republicans"], "timestamp": "2018-09-09T00:00:00"}

Facing ugly projections for a GOP rout, the president is trying to persuade voters to stick with Republicans by arguing they’ve delivered an economic turnaround. But many major gauges on economic growth and job growth were just as strong during parts of the Obama years, even without Trump‘s deregulation and deficit-boosting tax cuts.\n\n“One of the hypotheses that’s been floating around,\" Hassett said in the briefing, \"is that the strong economy that we’re seeing is just a continuation of recent trends.\" But \"economic historians will 100 percent accept the fact that there was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump, and that a whole bunch of data items started heading north.\"\n\nHassett made his case against the Obama economy in a series of charts that were also posted online, including measures of small-business optimism and business investment.\n\nThe charts showed capital investment to have declined by various measures during the second half of Obama's second term and then to have abruptly increased after Trump's election. A former Obama administration official countered that capital investment is rising globally, making it doubtful that it can be attributed to U.S government policy.\n\nThe former official also puzzled over the charts' presentation of data as a series of six-quarter averages rather than by the usual measure of a month, a quarter or a year. \"They form-shopped what they were doing,\" this person said.\n\nHassett conceded, however, that Trump erred earlier in the day when he tweeted, \"The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!\"\n\n“What is true is that it’s the highest in 10 years,\" Hassett said, noting, \"I don't run the council of Twitter advisers.\"\n\nWhat no one disputes is that under both presidents, unemployment fell and wages grew slowly. In a further sign that the Trump administration feels the lily of strong economic growth needs gilding, Hassett released a report last week recalculating after-tax wage growth to 1.4 percent over the past year; according to the standard measure used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average wage gains have during the past year run about even with inflation. (But on Friday, BLS reported that average hourly earnings in August were up 2.9 percent over the previous year, the best monthly performance in a decade.)\n\nErnie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI who worked at the Treasury Department under Obama, noted that some of Hassett's data were based on surveys of employers. \"I agree with Hassett that there does seem to have been a firming of sentiment,\" he said.\n\nBut Tedeschi said that recent increases in fixed investment were driven in part by expenditures for hurricane recovery and \"some one-time effects related to the tariffs.\" For example, he said, a recent surge in exports may reflect U.S. companies \"trying to get in before the tariffs took effect.\"\n\nThis article tagged under: Donald Trump", "name": "Trump fights to wrest credit for the economy from Obama", "description": "The White House, facing a brutal midterm landscape, is looking for ways to bask in the glow of a nine-year economic expansion.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/10/trump-obama-economy-775189", "id": "b3fe967717cee162a58f36bfbf75c9ed74e629d5", "keywords": ["fights", "white", "growth", "credit", "trying", "obama", "trump", "strong", "wrest", "economic", "house", "economy", "hassett"], "timestamp": "2018-09-10T00:00:00"}

Only 19 percent consider it very or extremely important that a candidate shares their own beliefs, and nearly half say that's not very important or not important at all.\n\nStill, most Americans see a role for religion in shaping public policy. A solid majority of Americans, 57 percent, want the influence of religion on government policy to extend beyond traditional culture war issues and into policies addressing poverty. Americans are more likely to say religion should have at least some influence on poverty than on abortion (45 percent) or LGBT issues (34 percent).\n\nThere is little public support for the campaign by some conservative religious leaders, backed by President Donald Trump, to allow clergy and religious organizations to endorse political candidates while retaining their tax exempt status. Such a change is opposed by 53 percent of Americans and supported by 13 percent. The rest expressed no opinion.\n\nTrump's stance on political endorsements by clergy is one of many reasons he has retained strong support among white evangelical Christians, despite aspects of his behavior and personal life that don't neatly align with Christian values. The AP-NORC poll found that 7 in 10 white evangelical Protestants say they approve of Trump, a Republican.\n\nThe importance of a candidate's religious faith varied across religious and political groups.\n\nAmong white evangelical Protestants, 51 percent consider it very or extremely important that a candidate has strong religious beliefs. An additional 25 percent think it's moderately important. Far fewer Catholics and white mainline Protestants considered this important.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of Republicans said it's at least moderately important that a candidate has strong religious beliefs, compared with 37 percent of Democrats.\n\nJack Kane, an accountant from Key West, Florida, was among the Republican-leaning poll participants who said it wasn't important to him whether a candidate was deeply religious.\n\n\"I'd much rather have a guy run the government and not spend all our money, instead of sounding off on what's going on in the church or on things like abortion,\" said Kane, 65, who describes himself as nonreligious. \"Who is Catholic, Jewish, Southern Baptist — I could care less, as long as they're going to carry the torch of freedom.\"\n\nKent Jaquette, a Republican-turned-independent and a former United Methodist pastor who lives near San Antonio, said he does not base his choice of candidates on their religious faith.\n\n\"In politics, you need to look at a person where their morals are, where their values are,\" he said. \"It may or may not have anything to do with their religion.\"\n\nJaquette also questioned the motives of evangelicals who support Trump.\n\n\"To me, it's supporting someone who gives no indication he intends to live a Christian life,\" said Jaquette, 63. \"I believe that Christians should do things that Christ taught — feed the hungry, visit people in jail, help immigrants.\"\n\nVeronica Irving, a 55-year-old Roman Catholic Republican who lives near Chicago, says it's extremely important to her that a politician has strong religious beliefs. She's disappointed that Trump doesn't demonstrate this more clearly through his behaviors and actions.\n\n\"It's not about what faith you come from — it's just important that you have faith,\" she said.\n\nAt the highest levels of political office, it's still rare for a politician to profess that he or she is an atheist; surveys indicate that roughly 10 percent of Americans do not believe in a higher power. In recent years, only a small handful of members of Congress have identified themselves as nonbelievers.\n\nHowever, there is some evidence of increasing acceptance of religious diversity — for example, the recent victories by Muslim-American women in Democratic congressional primaries in Michigan and Minnesota.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll found broad interest in religion having at least some influence on a range of policy issues.\n\nIn addition to the concern about poverty, 49 percent of Americans want to see religion have some influence on education, 44 percent on health care policy, 43 percent on immigration, 38 percent on gun policy, 36 percent on income inequality, 34 percent on foreign policy and 32 percent on climate change.\n\nFrom each of the largest religious groups, there was strong support for greater religious influence on poverty policy — 71 percent of white evangelical Protestants, 54 percent of white mainline Protestants, 75 percent of nonwhite Protestants and 67 percent of Catholics.\n\nThe Rev. Jim Wallis, founder of the Christian social justice organization Sojourners, said the poll findings signaled a potentially broader and more vibrant role for organized religion in U.S. politics.\n\n\"Religious issues are much broader and deeper and different from the issues chosen by the religious right,\" he said. \"The issues like poverty, immigration, what happens to the homeless — those are becoming the moral and political and voting issues for more and more Christians.\"\n\nThe findings were welcomed by Maureen Malloy Ferguson, a senior policy adviser for The Catholic Association, which depicts its mission as \"being a faithful Catholic voice in the public square.\"\n\n\"It's encouraging to see that so many Americans recognize that religion can be a force for good in society,\" she said.\n\nHowever, attorney Emilie Kao, a religious-freedom expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, questioned whether faith-based organizations might face roadblocks in trying to expand their role in social services. Some jurisdictions, she noted, have sought to exclude religious organizations from various activities, such as adoption and foster care, because of opposition to same-sex marriage and other beliefs.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Polling Editor Emily Swanson and AP writer Hannah Fingerhut in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,055 adults was conducted Aug. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

Of those, 3,076 are still under suppression orders that keep the details away from the public — 345 are felony criminal cases — as they work their way through the legal system, according to state computer records.\n\nUntil recently, no information about any of the suppressed cases was available publicly — not the names of the defendants, the charges they faced or even the identity of the judges who closed them — until The Post began questioning the practice.\n\nThe Post identified 66 felony cases that remained closed to the public — including homicides and sex crimes requiring registration as a sexual offender — even though the defendants had already been convicted and sentenced, some to lengthy prison terms.\n\nIn every suppressed case, The Post found, the judge’s suppression order and the reasons supporting it are shielded from public scrutiny. Courthouse employees and many law enforcement officials, including prosecutors, will not even acknowledge the suppressed cases exist, The Post found.\n\nThat means someone could be arrested, charged, convicted and sent to prison in Colorado without anyone seeing why, how or where, and whether the process was fair.\n\n“This sounds like the Star Chamber to me,” said Alan Chen, a constitutional law professor at University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law, referring to the 15th-century English court chastised for arbitrary rulings and secret proceedings. “Colorado is one of the worst states in terms of access to criminal court records for reasons I really have no explanation for. I’ve not heard of this being practiced anywhere else in the country. It’s frightening that if anything improper is going on, no one will know about it or have any way to find out.”\n\nAlthough courtrooms remain open to the public, including hearings for suppressed cases, the only way to know when a hearing is to occur is to be there when it is scheduled. A Denver Post reporter happened to attend one hearing in which a murder suspect pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and no public record of the event existed. The only way to learn the defendant’s name was to be there when the judge announced it.\n\nAccording to interviews and analysis of cases that were later opened to the public, the reasons behind a suppression order are varied: Prosecutors don’t want to alarm other members of a drug ring as they’re being rounded up; the case involves a juvenile defendant; or law enforcement says a criminal investigation is ongoing. Civil cases have been suppressed as well, typically — though not all — to shield victims of abuse or sexual assaults from publicity.\n\nBut there are other reasons as well. The Post found one criminal case — that of a board member and part-owner of the Broomfield Academy charged and convicted of felony sexual assault of a child and misdemeanor child abuse — in which prosecutors requested and received a suppression order to avoid publicity. The case remains suppressed.\n\nIt found another — of a member of the Adams County 14 school board eventually convicted with attempting to lure a child for sex — in which the judge ordered the suppression at the outset, without anyone even asking for it, because the judge “had concerns about releasing information,” records obtained by The Post show. The case remains suppressed.\n\nThe case of Clifford Galley, 28, convicted of attempted first-degree murder, was one of a number The Post found that remained suppressed long after the defendant went to prison. Galley was sentenced to 169 years in prison and won’t see freedom in his lifetime. Documents related to the case were suppressed after his arrest in 2013 and no one except for his lawyer, prosecutors or a judge could see them. Last month, a judge lifted the suppression order after The Post asked prosecutors questions about it. His appeal, however, remains suppressed.\n\nDenver Post emails to several of the judges responsible for suppressed cases went unanswered except for one, and that judge passed it along to state court administrators to respond.\n\nSuppressed cases are different than those sealed by the court, the reasons for which are limited by state law. Sealed cases are restricted to those where a defendant was exonerated or, under certain conditions, the case was dismissed, such as with a deferred sentence. Some low-level drug felonies can also be sealed under specific criteria.\n\nBy contrast, a judge may suppress a case for any reason at his or her discretion — usually, but not always, at the request of lawyers in the case, but most frequently prosecutors. Once a case is suppressed, it remains so until a judge reopens it, which The Post found often does not happen because neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors ever bother to ask.\n\n“This isn’t right; it can’t be right. It’s a chance for them to victimize our family all over again,” said Mark Chalfant, whose son, Mark, was killed in a Taco Bell parking lot in Aurora in July 2014. Four teenagers were convicted in the case — one as a juvenile — yet all the records remain closed under suppression orders three years later.\n\nHow news coverage of two high-profile sex-crime cases faded after they were suppressed by Colorado judges Douglas County sheriff’s officers had arrested one of their own — Deputy Robert “Mike” French — in the early hours of Feb. 9, 2013, on suspicion of trying to lure a 16-year-old boy into a sexual relationship. It was a Saturday and French, then 41, was taken to the Douglas County Detention Facility at about 3:30 a.m. He was kept there until he was to appear before a judge two days later. On Monday morning, before any word that French had been arrested was made public, Senior Deputy District Attorney Jay Williford asked a judge to suppress the case and all the information surrounding French’s arrest and the crimes he was accused of committing, court records show. The judge agreed. Continue reading\n\nAlthough media attention about the shooting and the arrests was widespread, the court cases were immediately suppressed. Only the 30-year sentence of triggerman Sterling Hook made a headline in a local newspaper a year later — after prosecutors released the information.\n\n“No one else ever gets to know what they’ve done,” Chalfant said, noting that no one other than family attended court hearings spread over a year. “That’s just wrong.“\n\nCourt records “critically important”\n\nOpen-records experts and several attorneys interviewed by The Post were troubled by the newspaper’s findings, saying it runs against the Colorado and U.S. constitutions and their guarantee of an open and accessible court system.\n\n“Court records in general are a critically important source of information for the public,” said Jeff Roberts, executive director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. “Without access to court records and proceedings, Coloradans can’t monitor the judicial system. They can’t know whether it’s working properly or not.”\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court in June refused to declare that access to court records is an absolute right guaranteed by the First Amendment or the Colorado Constitution. But that decision dealt with a specific document that had been sealed within a court file, not the entire case itself or its details.\n\nThe Post’s investigation also found:\n\n— Most suppressed cases had scant or no media attention, and the majority of the few that did were typically at the time of a defendant’s arrest, before anything was suppressed by a judge. Several suppressed cases did get press coverage when charges were filed and again after a defendant was sentenced, when prosecutors issued an announcement — but nothing in between.\n\n— Until recently, no trace of a suppressed case existed in the public-access computers the state provides at county courthouses throughout Colorado, or the online for-pay services that compile the same data and the state recommends to the public. That has changed since The Post began inquiring. Until last week, the public still could not see what charges had been brought against a person in a suppressed case or see any details about it, such as the next court hearing or any sentence given.\n\n— Sealed cases are restricted by law to only the judge who issued the order, and acknowledging their existence is prohibited. Public information about suppressed cases, however, per Colorado Supreme Court rule, should include names and case numbers, though the details of a case and the courtroom proceedings around it have been restricted. Despite that, court officials and some prosecutors’ offices still treat the two types of cases as the same and refuse to give any information about a suppressed case.\n\n— Public schedules posted daily outside of courtrooms, called dockets, show the cases being heard that day, including the names of defendants. If the case is suppressed, however, the docket only shows that a time is allotted for a hearing, but not why or for whom.\n\n— Even high-profile cases that received intense publicity are under suppression orders, meaning access to any of their court records today is prohibited. Among them: Aurora theater shooter James Holmes; witness killers Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray; and Jessica Ridgeway killer Austin Sigg. The media was able to follow these cases by appearing at a public court hearing to learn when the next was to be held. Many times prosecutors and defense lawyers say they simply forgot the case was still suppressed.\n\n“That’s very troubling”\n\nThe Denver Post began investigating suppressed cases in Colorado nearly a year ago after reporters were denied access to records and expressed concern about the practice. The Post obtained data from the State Court Administrator that helped it determine the extent to which suppressions have been used in each judicial district in Colorado. The Post then reviewed dozens of suppressed cases that have been unsuppressed to see how the practice was being used.\n\nSince 2013, there have been 6,707 cases suppressed by judges in Colorado, and the bulk of them were criminal cases, The Post found — misdemeanors first, then felonies, followed by civil court matters. A judge’s suppression order was lifted in 3,631 of them, meaning the public can now access the cases, sometimes soon after a defendant was arrested or parties to a civil lawsuit were served with court papers, records show.\n\n“Generally it’s one thing to suppress a (single) document, which is very legitimate, but when entire files begin to disappear from the public record, that’s very troubling,” Denver attorney Larry Pozner said. “We’re very skeptical in America of things done in the dark, and other than juvenile law, you can walk into an American courtroom and take notes, and they can’t say, ‘It’s none of your business, get out of here.’ ”\n\nThe Post’s analysis found that the number of suppressed cases varies dramatically from county to county. Prosecutors in La Plata County, where Durango is the county seat, have suppressed 366 felony cases over the past five years, the most by any jurisdiction, records show. But those cases were nearly always unsuppressed once a defendant was arrested and brought to court, the longest taking two years, The Post found.\n\n“It’s not uncommon to suppress a case until the defendant is arrested and the warrant served,” said Christian Champagne, district attorney for Colorado’s Sixth Judicial District that includes La Plata, Archuleta and San Juan counties. “Ours is an area where people come through and leave for long stretches of time.”\n\nIn the 18th Judicial District, which is made up of Arapahoe, Douglas, Lincoln and Elbert counties, 62 cases are still suppressed from public view even though the defendants have been tried, convicted and sentenced, The Post found, the highest among the state’s 22 judicial districts. The majority of the cases — 47, most of them from a single drug-conspiracy investigation from four years ago — are in Arapahoe County, followed by 14 others in Douglas County, and one in Elbert County.\n\nThat total doesn’t include 115 active felony cases that are still under suppression in the district — nearly half the statewide total, The Post found.\n\n“I still think there are some legitimate reasons on behalf of the safety of certain victims and witnesses … that we ought to have the ability to continue to suppress those,” 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler said.\n\nIn 2015, prosecutors asked that the Douglas County sex-assault case against Broomfield Academy then-owner and board member Michael Greenberg, 62, be suppressed because it likely would garner a lot of media attention. A television station reported his arrest. There was no media report after the suppression order was issued. The private school is to close this year, according to its website.\n\nThe case has remained suppressed ever since even though Greenberg pleaded guilty to felony sexual assault of a child in which he received a four-year deferred sentence, and to a misdemeanor charge of child abuse. He is a registered sex-offender in Centennial, records show. Following The Post’s inquiry, prosecutors have asked a judge to unsuppress the case.\n\n“Our office filed a motion to suppress, the reason being is that the case would be subject to extensive pretrial publicity,” Brauchler’s Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Rich Orman told The Post in an email, saying he and Brauchler were not consulted by the DA who handled the case. “This was a mistake, and we should not have sought suppression of a court file for this reason.”\n\nBrauchler said suppression orders sometimes are important to solving serious crimes, but concedes that once their usefulness is over, cases should not remain hidden from public scrutiny.\n\n“Already in many cases, specifically gang and some domestic violence cases, the concern over an individual’s own safety is so strong that if you can’t provide some other assurance, even in the short-term, I think we’ll lose out on cooperation from a lot of key witnesses,” Brauchler said. “But the public should maintain the ability to scrutinize what we do, why we do it and how we go about that.”\n\nAfter speaking with The Post, Brauchler’s office began unsuppressing many of the cases and instituted policies limiting how the practice should be used in the future. There are some cases, however, that Brauchler said should remain suppressed for the safety of the defendant — one of whom is serving a 16-year prison term in a rural county jail after having testified against another defendant who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, records show.\n\nThere have been no suppressed cases involving a criminal defendant in Denver District Court the past five years, the years The Post reviewed, according to records.\n\n“This is just a completely foreign procedure in my years of experience as a district attorney,” said former Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey. “In my 33 years, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never even heard of suppressing an entire case. How can you have cases that don’t even show up on a court docket? I’ve never seen such a thing.”\n\nExperts in open-records law say the practice of suppressing entire cases rubs against the grain of a system intended to be transparent.\n\n“The most outrageous, unjustifiable and unconstitutional thing you’ve found is the public being denied the right to know which cases are on file in our courts of law against which defendants, and to have access, at the minimum, to the indexes of those cases,” said Denver attorney Steven Zansberg, an expert on open-records laws who represents a number of media outlets including The Denver Post.\n\n“How is there a case where the public doesn’t know how or why someone is arrested or in prison?” he asked. “Courts throughout the land have held the public — we the people — have a constitutional First Amendment right to have access to those records.”\n\nMany cases suppressed\n\nWhen Frank Huner Jr., a 58-year-old Sedalia man, was charged in July 2017 with first-degree murder for allegedly killing his son, whom he said he mistook for an intruder, news of his arrest peppered the media.\n\nSince then, however, there’s been not a word about the Douglas County case — and not a single reference to it could be found anywhere among the state’s courthouse databases available for the public to search criminal and civil cases. Courthouse employees refused to identify the case even existed.\n\nDuring the course of The Post’s investigation, the State Court Administrator has changed the computer programs that provide the public with information about criminal and civil cases so that a defendant’s name, case number and the county where the case is being heard is displayed.\n\nUntil a week ago the public could not see the charges they faced or details about a suppressed case’s progress through the judicial system.\n\nSuch is the case of Daniel Pesch, a 34-year-old Littleton man charged in December 2017 for the 2010 murder of Kiowa High School science teacher Randy Wilson. The case has been suppressed since the moment it was filed, even though the media covered Pesch’s arrest. It’s only been recently unsuppressed after dozens of hearings. Still, several key portions of the case remain concealed from public view.\n\nAs well with Jeffrey Falk, 54, a former ThunderRidge High School math teacher sentenced in June 2016 to 21 years in prison for victimizing young boys and collecting “a library of child porn.” He had pleaded guilty in Arapahoe County district court to three counts of sexual exploitation of a child two months earlier.\n\nHis arrest in 2015 made headlines, but the four cases against him were immediately suppressed until he was sentenced. No other stories were published until after he pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and prosecutors later made a public announcement in June 2016.\n\nOne of the four cases against Falk was unsuppressed a month after that, records show — but the other three felony cases for which he was sentenced remained closed. That changed on June 13 after The Post began asking why.\n\nThe first-degree murder case in Adams County against juvenile Aidan Zellmer remains suppressed even though a judge has already ruled the 15-year-old is to stand trial as an adult.\n\nAnd despite media coverage about the case, the warrant affidavit that describes the evidence that led to Zellmer’s arrest remains suppressed, as well as any other information about the case against him.\n\nEven when a defendant has been charged, convicted and sent to prison, if the case is suppressed, some district attorney’s offices still treat it as if the matter has been sealed, even though the two are very different.\n\n“The short answer is that suppressed and sealed means the same thing to the extent the public is barred from access,” Denver district attorney’s office spokesman Ken Lane told The Post when asked to provide information about a suppressed case from 2013 in which Denver was the special prosecutor in a different county. “So, if whatever case you’re referring to is in fact suppressed by a court order, then respectfully, I’m not going to violate a court order and release case information to the public.”", "name": "Shrouded justice: Thousands of Colorado court cases hidden from public view on judges’ orders", "description": "Thousands of court cases across Colorado -- hundreds of them involving violent felonies -- are hidden from public view, concealed behind judges' orders that can remain in effect for years, The Denver Post has found.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP) Story Highlights Catholic church sex abuse victims and their advocates will protest today\n\nThey say the Archdiocese has done little to support victims of sex abuse\n\nThe Kentucky attorney general will seek the Legislature's permission to form a statewide grand jury to investigate Kentucky's Catholic dioceses in line with last month's damning report on Pennsylvania Catholic churches.\n\nThat report showed church leaders protected more than 300 \"predator priests\" for decades in six Pennsylvania dioceses because they were more interested in safeguarding the church and the abusers than in ministering to victims.\n\nDeputy Attorney General J. Michael Brown said his office has been in contact with Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and that his staff will \"in the near future\" draft legislation to put to lawmakers in Frankfort.\n\n\"We are working to secure justice for individual survivors who have reached out to the Attorney General’s office,\" Brown said in a statement.\n\nIn response, the Archdiocese told the Courier Journal that \"we have always cooperated with the authorities in our response to sexual abuse and will continue to do so.\"\n\nThe attorney general's announcement followed a protest at the steps of the Cathedral of Assumption in downtown Louisville, in which about two-dozen Catholic sex abuse victims and their advocates gathered to condemn the Catholic Church.\n\nThe group, which urged the AG to investigate dioceses here, demanded the Archdiocese of Louisville take 16 steps to rectify the legacy of widespread abuse.\n\nMore: Will more states follow Pennsylvania's lead and investigate priest sexual abuse? Here's what they say\n\nMore: New York attorney general issues subpoenas over sexual abuse in Catholic Church\n\nMore: Vermont authorities investigating orphanage abuse, bishop pledges full cooperation\n\nThe protest was one of nine held around the nation in the wake of Pennsylvania's grand jury report.\n\nThe local protesters, who included parishioners, victims, social workers and ex-Catholics, said both the Archdiocese of Louisville and the Catholic Church as a whole have failed to support victims of sex abuse and to hold accountable complicit church staff.\n\nSome waved signs demanding transparency, advocating for feminist theology or calling for parishioners to \"step up and be on the side of truth.\"\n\nFrank Diebold, a victim of abuse as an altar boy, drew a contrast between the way Papa John's handled its leader and how the Vatican is handling an accused cardinal.\n\nPapa John's ousted their namesake and founder, John Schnatter, shortly after executives learned he used the n-word in a conference call.\n\n\"And the Catholic Church can't get rid of a cardinal,'' Diebold said. \"Who's got more integrity? The pizza shop or the Catholic Church?\"\n\nThe Louisville Archdiocese paid $25.7 million in the early 2000s to 240 people who said they were sexually abused by priests, religious brothers and church employees.\n\nThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) says the archdiocese has not done enough to rectify those crimes and issued the following demands:\n\nStop using euphemisms like “inappropriate behavior” when speaking about sexual abuse of children, which includes rape and sodomy.\n\nFire employees who knew of the cover-up of sexually abusive priests.\n\nSeverely discipline any priests who knew of sexual abuse taking place.\n\nCut off all financial support to priests convicted of crimes.\n\nAppoint victims of priest sexual abuse to the Archdiocese of Louisville board that reviews allegations. (Archbishop Joseph Kurtz said the board until recently has had a victim member.)\n\nPost the names and assignments of credibly accused priests\n\nAmend the sex-abuse training document used by all employees and volunteers who work with children, which scarcely references priests as possible abusers.\n\nStop requiring victims to agree to confidentiality agreements to receive settlements.\n\nInvite victims to meet with seminarians and new priests.\n\nPut more women in prominent roles.\n\nEstablish support groups for victims.\n\nExplain to the public in greater detail what happens when the church commits priests to a \"life of prayer and penance,\" a form of dismissal from ministry following credible sex abuse allegations.\n\nList dates and locations of efforts showing what the archdiocese has done to help victims heal.\n\nProvide a complete list of settlements paid since 1990, including names of abusive priests and settlement amounts.\n\nLaunch a speaker's forum at Bellarmine University featuring the foremost authorities on sex abuse within the Catholic church.\n\nCommission a statue that commemorates victims.\n\nCal Pfeiffer, leader of the Louisville chapter of SNAP, said at the protest that walls need to come down between church leadership and victims.\n\n\"Forgiving is a tough concept, especially when some of the people that need to be forgiven don't even ask for it, don't reach out for forgiveness,\" he said. \"Forgiveness is also critical for victims and survivors in their healing. It would sure help if there was something to latch on to where they feel the church, Archdiocese, the pope are really behind them.\"\n\nThe group wants Kurtz to respond by the end of this month.\n\nKurtz on Monday released a statement saying that some suggestions he heard are already in place, others require action on a broader scale and a number of them are good to consider for the future.\n\nHe invited Catholics to join him in a prayer and fasting on Oct. 5 and said he will release a report in October that chronicles how the Archdiocese has handled sexual abuse.\n\nHe wrote that he also is traveling this week to Washington, D.C., to meet with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, where the group will discuss how best to report bishop misconduct and resolve complaints.\n\nMore: Trump on Catholic sex-abuse scandal: 'It's so sad to watch'\n\nMore: When boy told of sexual abuse, his parents asked the priest who raped him to counsel him\n\n\"I agree with the victim survivors and advocates that the truth of sexual abuse by priests and other Church leaders needs to be faced squarely. Silence is not the answer,\" he wrote in an email. \"There may have been judgement calls made over the years that individuals disagree with, and I respect their right to disagree.\"\n\nHe said he has consistently and promptly reported abuse to authority, removed offenders and communicated with local parishes.\n\nHe noted that a third-party audit recently found the diocese compliant with the “Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People,” created by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2002. Among other things, the charter calls on churches to create safe spaces for children, promptly and effectively respond to allegations, cooperate with civil authorities and help survivors heal.\n\nSince 2003, more than 48,000 volunteers and employees who work with children have undergone background checks and completed a workshop on ways to spot abuse.\n\n\"It's a need for us as a community to always repair and renew ourselves,\" Kurtz said. \"The Church of Jesus Christ is one that requires us to seek to protect one another and that is my intent.\"\n\nFollow Caitlin McGlade on Twitter: @caitmcglade.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2x2IRw6", "name": "Church sex abuse: Kentucky attorney general wants to investigate state Catholic dioceses", "description": "A Louisville group for Catholic Church sex abuse victims says little has been done to hold complicit church officials accountable.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/09/10/kentucky-attorney-general-investigate-church-sex-abuse/1262900002/", "id": "1c21409011fd99924c0cc262dadcdf26a620ed0f", "keywords": ["state", "sex", "catholic", "dioceses", "sexual", "wants", "kentucky", "archdiocese", "priests", "general", "abuse", "victims", "attorney", "church", "louisville", "investigate"], "timestamp": "2018-09-10T00:00:00"}

While significant aspects of the president’s broader agenda — including immigration and trade policy, and the proposed border wall with Mexico — remain mired in confusion, and as the administration struggles under the investigation into the presidential campaign’s ties with Russia, the E.P.A. and Interior Department have steadily pressed forward with rollbacks of environmental regulations.\n\n“In other areas of policymaking, like immigration and health care, they appear to have brought into the administration ideologues who don’t know a lot about policymaking,” said Cecilia Muñoz, who directed the White House Domestic Policy Council in the Obama administration. “But in climate change and energy, they appear to have brought in people who know exactly what they’re doing, and know exactly where the levers are.”\n\nThe pace of the proposals has not been slowed by the resignation in July of Scott Pruitt, who left the top job at the E.P.A. under a cloud of ethics scandals. Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who worked in the E.P.A. under the first President George Bush, is now the agency’s acting chief.\n\nThe E.P.A.’s new methane proposal, according to the draft seen by The Times, would loosen a 2016 rule that required oil and gas drillers to perform leak inspections as frequently as every six months on their drilling equipment, and to repair leaks within 30 days. The proposed amendment would lengthen that to once a year in most cases, and to as infrequently as once every two years for low-producing wells. It would also double the amount of time a company could wait before repairing a methane leak from 30 to 60 days.\n\nIt would also double the amount of time required between inspections of the equipment that traps and compresses the natural gas, from once every three months to once every six months. On the Alaskan North Slope, where oil and gas companies contend that harsh weather makes it difficult to conduct inspections, such equipment would only have to be monitored annually.\n\nIn addition, the E.P.A. proposal would let energy companies operating in states that have their own state-level methane standards follow those standards instead of the federal ones. That would include states such as Texas, where the pollution standards have been more lax than federal standards.\n\nIf implemented, the proposal would recoup nearly all the costs to the oil and gas industry that would have been imposed by the Obama-era regulation. The E.P.A. estimated that rule would have cost companies about $530 million by 2025. The E.P.A. estimates that the proposed changes would save the oil and gas industry $484 million by the same year.\n\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.", "name": "Trump Administration Wants to Make It Easier to Release Methane Into Air", "description": "In a victory for energy companies, the administration plans to roll back rules covering methane leaks and the “flaring,” or burning, of the potent greenhouse gas.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/climate/methane-emissions-epa.html", "id": "176879da00b70acc1c480b7585d48229e76228a9", "keywords": ["epa", "easier", "air", "proposed", "proposal", "proposals", "companies", "wants", "trump", "oil", "standards", "inspections", "gas", "administration", "release", "methane"], "timestamp": "2018-09-10T00:00:00"}

It’s a pilot project designed to demonstrate tiny homes, arranged in a community where rules are set by the residents themselves, should be part of the solution to combating homelessness in Denver.\n\nIt’s had its challenges. Two of the original residents returned to the streets after their neighbors asked them to leave for violating village rules. The village had to move about 200 feet in January — from one side of its lot to the other — at a cost of $25,000 because of now-changed city rules governing temporary residential structures. The city chipped in $10,000.\n\nBut Beloved has persevered. A year after opening, supporters are touting the results of a University of Denver study of the village as proof it is improving lives, both for its residents who were chronically homeless and in the surrounding community.\n\n“Unfortunately, the residents here have had to be the guinea pigs, but they have helped us sort out some of the issues that will help improve the model as we scale into the future,” Cole Chandler, a member of the Colorado Village Collaborative, said. “We intend to see dozens of these villages across the metro area.”\n\nThe study assessed the village from its opening on July 21, 2017, through April. Among the key findings:\n\nOf the 12 original village residents who participated in the study — one person declined — 10 remained housed through April. It goes beyond the scope of the study, but those 10 people are still in stable housing today, Chandler said,\n\nThree residents moved out of the village into housing of their own. Two of them, a couple, saved up for their own apartment, Chandler said. A third person was approved for Section 8 rental assistance.\n\nAnd all villagers — nine of whom were already working when they moved in — were either employed, in school or collecting disability, as of April. That fact also holds true today.\n\nTo read the full findings of the study, visit bartoninstitute.org/tiny-homes.\n\nThere were 5,317 people experiencing homelessness in Denver and seven surrounding counties in January, according to a point-in-time report compiled by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative. For Chandler, whose organization was created to help establish and support tiny home villages in Denver, the study demonstrates that more communities like Beloved should be built in the metro area and soon.\n\n“The idea was to build low-barrier housing for people with barriers to accessing the existing system” he said, noting each tiny home cost $22,000 to build. “With traditional housing-first scenarios, there are a lot of overhead costs with all of the support systems that they create, which are very helpful for a large portion of the population. We can do things at a lower cost.”\n\nThe study was performed by the DU’s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. It was commissioned by the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, also a part of DU. The institute has invested a combined $91,725in building and assessing the Beloved village and a proposed second village that Chandler’s group is seeking to build in Denver, director Rebecca Arno said.\n\nArno suspects the village’s self-governing model, with residents setting guidelines for behavior and other aspects of community life, has empowered the people living there.\n\nCersilla Wolf, one of the village’s charter members, has enrolled in college classes, opened an Etsy.com shop selling her own crocheted wares and began working at nearby Bigsby’s Folly Winery & Restaurant in RiNo, which reached out to the Colorado Village Collaborative about hiring a villager.\n\nWolf also has taken on the mantle of resident finder. She built a second, lofted bed into her home and brought in two other people struggling to find stable housing to live with her.\n\nFreddie Martin has been Wolf’s roommate since March after meeting her on the Metro State University campus. A history major who takes notes during village meetings to “create a historical record,” Martin said he hasn’t had a secure home in about a decade. He’s paid rent to live with friends but hasn’t been able to raise the money — including a security deposit and first and last month’s rent — to move out on his own. Now housed, he hopes to finish his degree in the fall.\n\n“This place has been a godsend,” Martin said.\n\nWolf’s first roommate, Kim Grier, lives next door now. The 27-year-old is trying to get a photography business off the ground while working at King Soopers.\n\n“When I got this house, this was the first place I ever had to live that wasn’t dependent on my emotional relationship with another person,” she said. “It’s a place that’s yours, where you can think.”\n\nThe DU study also examined the village’s impact on the surrounding neighborhood. Combining responses from a random sampling of nearby residents and a selective sampling of business owners, researchers found 78 percent of people in the area believe the village either didn’t hurt community safety or helped it — a perception supported by crime data.\n\n“Even the people who at the beginning of this process told me this will never work, this will be a disaster, have come back and said, ‘Wow, were we wrong,’ ” said RiNo Art District president Jamie Giellis. “It’s been awesome.”\n\nThe Village won’t be behind its colorful fence at 38th and Blake much longer. Chandler said an agreement is in place with a new property owner host, but he’s not ready to say where until more community outreach can be done. Colorado Village Collaborative hopes to raise $90,000 for a new commons building for the village when it does move, one with running water, three bathrooms and a full kitchen.\n\nUrban Land Conservancy, the nonprofit that owns the land Beloved sits on today, is moving forward with plans to develop the lot. The Walnut Street side will be turned into 66 affordable apartments in partnership with Medici Communities, conservancy president Aaron Miripol said. The Blake Street half will be sold to local developer McWhinney, which expects to build a 16-story mixed-use building that will also house Urban Land Conservancy’s office.\n\nColorado Village Collaborative was dealt a setback this month when Denver’s Landmark Preservation Commission voted that it could not proceed with building an eight-home women’s village on the property of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church at 2015 Glenarm Place because it didn’t fit with the surrounding historic district.\n\nThe vote was a temporary setback in Chandler’s view. He plans to meet next week with another property owner who he says has offered to host the women’s village for three years. He hopes to get it built before winter.\n\nMiripol, who has been involved with efforts to provide stable housing for people in need for decades, said he has been frustrated by the barriers that have cropped up and prevented the tiny home concept from growing in Denver and beyond. He hopes the results of the DU study will help turn the tide.\n\n“You can have a successful community like this. You can have an impact on people’s lives and you can do it in a way that is not harming the community, but in fact is very positive,” he said. “It’s important other folks step up and do this too.”", "name": "Tiny home village for homeless thriving in Denver’s RiNo district", "description": "A year after its opening, supporters are touting the results of a University of Denver study of the village as a proof it is improving lives, both for its residents who were previously experiencing chronic homelessness and in the surrounding community.", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/?p=3144383", "id": "a72f1fe9596904aa0b1f0b48b2594f6e1ffe6a1b", "keywords": ["village", "denvers", "study", "chandler", "villages", "homeless", "thriving", "denver", "community", "district", "housing", "tiny", "place", "rino", "residents"], "timestamp": "2018-07-27T12:00:24+00:00"}

That's concerning not just for Trump but for Republicans on the ballot this fall who are hoping Trump's approval numbers will be inching upward rather than downward with eight weeks left before November 6.\n\nThe roots of that rising disapproval may well be in the \"change agent\" question.

In a supplemental statement filed Saturday, lawyers for Trump said they would not seek to enforce any settlement and will accept Daniels’ claim that the contract was void or unenforceable. They also continued to insist that Trump was not himself party to it.\n\nHowever, Daniels' outspoken attorney Michael Avenatti said Friday that he views the legal tactic as a way of obscuring the truth.\n\n\"Michael Cohen is back to playing games and trying to protect Donald Trump. He is now pulling a legal stunt to try and 'fix it' so that we can’t depose Trump and present evidence to the American people about what happened,\" Avenatti wrote on Twitter. \"He is not a hero nor a patriot.

Fifteen years ago, Alvarado emigrated from San Luis Potosi in central Mexico, and has worked in the fields of California’s Central Valley ever since, picking food—broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, potatoes—and religiously listening to La Campesina, not for the prizes or the Mexican music, but because of the singular role it plays in the life of the farmworker community.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStop by any group of farmworkers here, and you’re likely to hear La Campesina. That’s as intended—the network was founded in 1983 by Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers with the goal of reaching farmworkers in the fields, and it is operated today by the Cesar Chavez Foundation. But where Chavez originally dreamed of programming that would serve the needs of Spanish-speaking immigrants by educating them about workers’ rights, today’s political climate demands something different to serve the immigrant audience. Though it’s happened largely out of the view of the mainstream news media, throughout Western states, La Campesina has adapted to the political moment by becoming something like the immigrant community’s version of Radio Free Europe—a voice of idealistic defiance broadcasting in hostile territory—at a time of deep partisan animus toward Latinos. Now, with nine stations across four states—from Yuma, Arizona, in the south to the tri-cities of Washington in the north, broadcasting in both AM and FM—it reaches more than 1 million regular listeners, many of them immigrants working in hotels, restaurants, and manufacturing or food-processing plants.\n\nWhile AM radio is often thought to be the turf of conservative talking heads, La Campesina’s KNAI is frequently the top-rated AM station in metropolitan Phoenix. In April, it had double the ratings of KFYI, the local station that carries Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck, competing against those broadcasting titans with regional Mexican music, resistance-themed commentary en Español, and practical life tips for getting by as a Latino immigrant in Trump’s America.\n\nAmong Campesina’s most popular regular segments: advice on what to do if approached by an agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For Alvarado, the radio contest winner, the prospect of being detained by ICE looms as her biggest fear. “We need to be on the lookout for la migra because they are going strong right now and they want us out of this country,” she says. It’s one of the main reasons she listens religiously to La Campesina: She and her colleagues carry a portable radio with them in the fields because they see the station as a lifeline.\n\nThat’s a role the radio network plays on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican listeners in San Luis Rio Colorado and Mexicali tune in to Yuma’s KCEC for its immigration-related programming. Other listeners as far south as Mexico City, Guatemala and El Salvador stream La Campesina’s programming online. All can hear tips on how to best avoid ICE and the resources available to them if they are detained.\n\n“We are a beacon of hope for immigrants and people who are coming to the country who do not necessarily have their footings here or don't necessarily know where to go for help,” says Cesar L. Chavez, grandson and namesake of the civil-rights leader and the general manager of La Campesina’s Bakersfield station for the past six years. “We try to guide them in the right direction.”\n\n“There is no wall for us,” says Maria Barquin, a longtime La Campesina employee who now directs programming for the entire network. “The signal crosses the wall.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe genesis of La Campesina came in 1962, when Cesar Chavez, along with leadership of what would become the United Farm Workers of America founded the National Farm Workers Association and adopted a resolution calling for the creation of a once a week, 30-minute Spanish language radio program to entertain and educate farmworkers. From that seed grew the vision for Radio Campesina, which formed in 1983 not as a single show, but an entire station—Visalia’s KUFW.\n\nToday, La Campesina’s programming consists of popular regional Mexican music hosted by colorful deejays, public service announcements and educational programming. Their daily network educational program, “Punto de Vista” (“Point of View”), covers topics related to immigration, health and education, with experts invited on to speak about those topics.\n\nWhen immigration raids expanded in California earlier this year, La Campesina adopted a new slogan to fits its more aggressive posture in opposing the crackdown—“La estación siempre en guardia,” or “the station always on guard.”\n\nHosts receive on-air phone calls from farmworkers who’ve encountered ICE and are willing to share their stories. Attorneys and psychologists offer educational commentaries, advising the immigrant community how to cope with the anxiety of family separation. In between, the station broadcasts an announcement from their current campaign: “Since the beginning of [the Trump] administration, the community has had to adapt to a new way of living. Millions of Latinos live in fear of seeing their families separated by an ICE detention. That is why at Radio Campesina, we are a station that is on guard against these actions. Here, we will tell you how to prepare your family with information that can help you in the case of a raid. Not having a status in this country does not make you a criminal. Get ready and act.”\n\n“We are protecting our community and informing them of their rights by giving them information about what to do if they get detained or if a friend gets detained,” says Barquin. This advice includes how to get representation by an attorney and how to secure their families and properties if they are deported.\n\nIn April, Radio Campesina’s team traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, to meet the migrant caravan that had traveled from Central America (and earned the ire of President Trump in the process), and broadcast a live show from across the border, hoping to create a bridge between immigrants wanting to enter the U.S and immigrants who are already there. Besides bringing together both sides of the border through their airwaves, La Campesina hoped to create awareness with all people, even those who are not part of the immigrant community.\n\nLa Campesina also traveled to the border in response to Trump’s family-separation policy. It broadcast live reports after every update on the issue. The crisis prompted the network to relaunch its annual “En guardia con mi voto” or “Get out to vote” campaign, with a more aggressive posture than ever before.\n\nThis summer, Campesina has expanded its efforts to reach a new audience: the sons and daughters of immigrants, people who see themselves as having a sort of dual identity. In Fresno, KBHH “Forge” has become the network’s first bilingual station (it already has an English-language station in Bakersfield; Forge is aimed at listeners who can speak both languages). “Forge” will follow the same strategy as its Campesina brethren but will play Top 40 music with a twist of Spanish-language songs.\n\n“The kids of those listeners of Radio Campesina are growing up,” says Barquin. “This generation needs to have empowerment maybe in a different language. We understand that they have the same roots as their parents in the culture that they love, but we also understand that the language and the music is something that is evolving as they come to a different country.”\n\nIt’s a country that, according to Alvarado, gives opportunities to immigrants that their homelands could not. “We came here to work, not to commit crime. We came here to progress,” says Alvarado. “We are not stealing, and they are not giving us anything for free. We are working for it.”\n\nOn the day Alvarado won lunch, local disc jockey Marimar Flores stopped by to help deliver it, and congratulated her on winning the contest. Alvarado’s fellow farmworkers let out a celebratory cheer and lined up for helpings of pork in green chile, salad, rice and beans. While they ate, a representative from a local health care provider taught them how to make a medical appointment. Throughout, it had the feeling of a celebration.\n\nWhen the food was gone and their plates cleared, the farmworkers waved goodbye to the radio station’s van as it drove away, kicking up dust in its wake.

As local sake brewers can attest, the path has been far cloudier for those trying to bring the traditional Japanese spirit to the masses.\n\nThanks to a law passed by the Colorado General Assembly this spring, the road map gets much clearer Wednesday. Sake, a rice-based beverage brewed like beer but noncarbonated and higher in alcohol like wine, has been added to the state liquor code as a “vinous liquor.”\n\n“As of Aug. 8, sake will be regulated like a wine in the state of Colorado,” state department of revenue spokesman Lawrence Pacheco said. “That means that residents will be able to buy sake in winery sales rooms.”\n\nIf things go according to plan, Colorado Sake Co. will open the state’s first sake tasting room in Denver’s RiNo district in September. The business, a self-financed operation based in a 1,000-square-foot brew space behind Wine & Whey at 3559 Larimer St., was a major driver behind the law change. Now, it hopes to be at the forefront of a sake wave.\n\n“We’ve always loved sake and we wondered why don’t more people drink sake,” Heather Dennis, one of the company’s co-owners said last week as she and her partners worked to stockpile inventory in advance of the new sales rules. “We realized it was an issue with access or lack of access. That’s why we want the tasting room. To introduce and educate people.”\n\nColorado Sake Co.’s origins date back to 2016. That’s when co-founder William Stuart went to an event where he tasted sake made by Denver-based brewer Gaijin 24886.\n\n“I said, ‘I can do that,’ ” Stuart recalled. He went home, found a recipe online and kicked his roommates out of the fridge so he could ferment his creation at the requisite 50 degrees.\n\nSake has four ingredients: rice, water, yeast and koji, an Asian culinary ingredient made of steamed rice that has sprouted mold spores. Unlike beer, where yeast is added to malted grain after it cooks to produce alcohol, all the ingredients in sake brew simultaneously in a process called multiple parallel fermentation.\n\nStuart said it took him a year to master making koji. From there, he experimented until developing a sake recipe he was pleased with. In May 2017, he and his partners went to the state to get a limited winery license. They were rejected.\n\n“We were told, ‘You’re manufacturing beer and you’re selling wine,'” Stuart said.\n\nBecause of narrow definitions in the state liquor code, a rule change was needed to include and regulate sake. While it is well-known to consumers — often served hot, or in the form of a shot dropped into a beer, much to the chagrin of its advocates and aficionados — it is only produced by about 20 brewers in the Unites States today, according advocacy group the Sake Education Council.\n\nAfter being denied a license, the Colorado Sake Co. team embarked on a journey through the state lawmaking process that included talking to legislators, dealing with lobbyists and fielding questions from wineries and big-time beer makers, Stuart said. Finally, with the help of primary sponsors state Sen. Lucia Guzman, D-Denver, and Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, the change was signed into law on April 11.\n\n“Ever since the days of Hakushika Sake in Golden, sake has kind of occupied this sort of gray area in the liquor code,” said Doug Caskey, executive director of the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board, an offshoot of the state department of agriculture dedicated to marketing local wine, cider, mead and, now, sake. “It was really great we got this law changed.”\n\nHakushika Sake USA Corp., a private Japanese company, shut down in 2001, state records show.\n\nGaijin 24886 lost its space because of the new law, founder and brewer Marc Hughes said. The facility was licensed for beer production, not wine. But Gaijin is focused on the positives. It is working on finding a new location with aims to open a tasting room by next summer. In the meantime, a few varieties of Gaijin can be purchased at Divino Wine & Spirits at 1240 S. Broadway.\n\n“There is a lot of interest in experimentation with different things in town,” Hughes said of sake’s prospects in a crowded Denver liquor market. “It’s just about finding the right way to capture it.”\n\nColorado Sake Co. isn’t being distributed in liquor stores at the moment, but its flagship varieties, American Standard and the cinnamon and vanilla flavored Horchata Nigori, are on tap at Mizu Izakaya in Highland. The restaurant, at 1560 Boulder St., carries at least 50 sakes per season. Colorado Sake Co. is the only American brand it stocks.\n\n“I think that it’s just incredible that we are going to have the opportunity to get sake into more and more consumers’ hands,” Mizu beverage director Jerrica Ash said. “My goal is to make sake a spirit that in every restaurant not just in Asian restaurants.”", "name": "Local sake brewers eager to take advantage as classification changes in Colorado", "description": "With more than 330 craft breweries operating in Colorado, home brewers have lots of examples to follow if they want to get their beer in front of the drinking public. As local sake brewers can attest, the path has been far cloudier for those trying to bring the traditional Japanese spirit to the masses.", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/?p=3158807", "id": "429d2b2c25ce94e41abdf8267637bdf985fd55e8", "keywords": ["beer", "brewers", "state", "local", "colorado", "went", "advantage", "eager", "changes", "wine", "classification", "sake", "liquor", "law", "tasting", "stuart"], "timestamp": "2018-08-08T12:00:22+00:00"}

That’s my main takeaway from reading 20 Bob Woodward books in the past four weeks. No one can beat Woodward at getting the story of the White House from the inside, from the perspective of the decision makers as they saw themselves. People tell Woodward things they shouldn’t, from the alarming (Trump aides swiping memos from his desk) to the mundane (Nixon trying to gnaw open a childproof cap on a pill bottle with his teeth). He may be the sole practitioner of a form that occupies a space between journalism and history, one that tries to balance immediacy with detail. When he’s onto a good story—the resignation of a president, Iran-Contra, America’s post-9/11 wars—there’s no one better, or at least no one better who’s faster.\n\nI began reading and ranking every freaking Woodward book—all of 20 of them; that’s almost 10,000 pages—when Fear, the new book about President Donald Trump, was announced last month. I read four on vacation in mid-August, then four more the next week, and then five more, and seven more. I learned a lot, even as I learned that not all palace intrigue is intriguing.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhy did I do it? Was it to uncover how the presidency has changed since Watergate? To prove that I could? So that you wouldn’t have to? All of the above. Still, I wouldn’t do it again, and neither should anybody else.\n\nPolitico Magazine acquired a copy of Fear this week, and I’ve read it. So here we go:\n\n\n\n***\n\n20. The Man Who Would Be President\n\nIt’s not quite accurate to say that I read this book, though I did turn every page. Co-written by David Broder, it’s a collection of articles, first published in The Washington Post during the buildup to the 1992 campaign, about Vice President Dan Quayle. Either Woodward or his publicist has banished the book from his website, which contains a lengthy description—and purchase button—for every other title that put his name on a dust jacket. Eighteen—soon to be 19—books, it says, and 12 No.1 bestsellers! But what about No. 20?\n\nSome Woodward acolytes argue that The Man Who Would Be President isn’t a book, because it was conceived and published as a newspaper series. You know, I’m looking at it right now, and it’s a book. It has pages and everything. Chapter 6 is titled, “The Vice President’s Driving Passion: Quayle Unleashes Competitive Energy on the Golf Course.” Woodward delights in uncovering details that presidents and senior administration figures have scrubbed from their official histories and omitted from their memoirs. Sorry, Bob. I found your smoking gun.\n\n19. The Price of Politics\n\nEver since State of Denial, his third book about the George W. Bush administration, Woodward has fashioned himself as much an analyst of the presidency as a just-the-facts conduit of White House secrets, gossip and intrigue. The Price of Politics cements this ascension from Washington Post cops reporter to D.C. eminence by opening with a first-person anecdote from the Gridiron Club dinner, one that condemns Barack Obama, then a newly elected senator from Illinois, as an inexperienced narcissist.\n\nAlas, then Woodward recedes from the story, a deadeningly thorough chronicle of the debt-ceiling negotiations between Barack Obama and John Boehner. Would I have been kinder to this book if it hadn’t been the 18th Bob Woodward book I read in the past four weeks? Maybe! But Michiko Kakutani called The Price of Politics “often tedious” when she reviewed it for the New York Times. Writing in the home turf of Woodward’s Washington Post, Jeff Shesol concurred, “If the hallmark of a Bob Woodward book is that it puts you in the room, you may well, before long, start clawing for the exits.”\n\nOr, as Woodward writes in the final paragraph, “There was so much effort, most of it sincere, but so little result.” He means the budget negotiations. I think.\n\n18. Obama’s Wars\n\nIt could be that No-Drama Obama just made for low-drama Woodward. There’s little that Woodward appears to enjoy more than quoting some presidential cursing, but no matter how impatient Obama gets with his generals in this account of his Afghanistan policy, POTUS stays PG-rated. “I’m pissed” is as profane as it gets, but even then “he didn’t raise his voice much.” (In The Price of Politics, Obama does tell some Democrats, “Stop this bullshit,” but still, Woodward says the president was only “close to losing his temper.”) At another moment, the best a frustrated Obama can muster is, “This presentation strains credulity.”\n\nIn both books, Obama is damaged by his distaste for politics and his newness to Washington. When Obama chooses Jim Jones as his national security adviser, Woodward writes, “He seemed to have reached the baffling conclusion that the lack of a personal relationship could be an asset.” John Podesta was “not sure,” Woodward adds, “that Obama felt anything, especially in his gut.” Instead, the president “intellectualized … essentially picking up the emotions of others and translating them into ideas.”\n\nBest anecdote: Richard Holbrooke, the newly appointed special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, invites the Pakistani ambassador to lunch at the Hay-Adams Hotel. Holbrooke insists on a public location “so it gets reported in the newspaper.” No one notices.\n\n17. Plan of Attack\n\nWhen the first Iraq war ended in 1991, there was a lot of talk about the end of America’s lingering “Vietnam syndrome.” By the time the second Iraq war began a decade later, Vietnam syndrome had been replaced by Gulf War syndrome, a national assumption that war could be brief, sterile and free of sacrifice. Plan of Attack is Woodward’s first, and definitely not last (he wrote four Bush at War books, amounting to more than 2,000 pages in eight years) stab at explaining what happened next.\n\nIt was heralded as Woodward’s comeback when it was published, but to my eye it’s the least of his four George W. Bush books. Plan of Attack is all war planning, but very little war, and it lacks the novelistic intimacy of Woodward’s best work. The tidbits that got Washington tittering 14 years ago (Colin Powell’s “Pottery Barn rule,” George Tenet’s “slam dunk,” Bush’s invocation of a “higher Father” than his dad) remain, and Plan of Attack is an important document of how and why the United States invaded with too few troops to win the peace (see: Donald Rumsfeld). But the characters in that drama are more vividly painted in Bush at War, and the consequences aren’t fully revealed until State of Denial and The War Within, which in many ways feel like Woodward’s attempts at a Plan of Attack do-over.\n\nUnderappreciated anecdote: The CIA floods Kurdistan with so many Benjamins to pay its sources that everything, “even a cup of coffee,” starts to cost $100.\n\n16. Maestro\n\nLike Plan of Attack, Woodward’s story of how Alan Greenspan helped create the prosperity of the 1990s feels like half a book. Unlike Plan of Attack, we never get the sequel, or the revision. There’s little about the asset bubbles—in stocks and in housing—whose bursting would define the next decade of economic policymaking, other than Greenspan’s uncertainty as to whether there’s anything he can safely do about them. This book, in short, could use some Ben Bernanke. (Janet Yellen, who was a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 1994 to 1997, does pop up now and again to fret that Greenspan isn’t putting on the brakes.) Still, we get an inside account of Greenspan’s Fed and its decision-making, not to mention his mastery of Washington schmoozing.\n\nMemorable anecdote: When Greenspan asked Andrea Mitchell to marry him, his proposal was so opaque that “either she had not understood what he was saying or it had failed to register”—on two different occasions.\n\n15. The Brethren\n\nWoodward’s first book after The Final Days, co-written with Scott Armstrong, begins as SCOTUS for Dummies: “The United States Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, is the final forum for appeal in the American judiciary.” While Woodward and Armstrong’s infiltration of the cloistered realm of justices and their clerks is impressive, the result reads like a collection of chronological anecdotes from the Burger Court, with little attempt to weigh their importance or meaning. Even so, anyone who thinks the Supreme Court wasn’t political in the 1970s will have their illusions dashed by reading about the vote-trading and logrolling in this book. And the deliberations over the Nixon tapes are like the second half of the political Law & Order episode that began in All the President’s Men.\n\nWoodward and Armstrong also gleefully track the Court’s struggles to define obscenity (“no erections and no insertions,” Byron White concludes at one point, and William Brennan’s clerks also apply what they call a “limp dick” standard: “Oral sex was tolerable if there was no erection”). The “humorous high point of most terms” was “movie day,” when justices and clerks watch the pornos under consideration in obscenity appeals.\n\nPossibly the most current sentences in the book: “It was only recently that activism on the Court had become ‘liberal’ activism, Rehnquist reminded them. Only forty years before, the Court’s activists were conservatives. The balance was once again shifting back, Rehnquist said. Once it had, liberals would be the ones calling for judicial restraint and chiding the conservatives for ignoring precedent.”\n\n14. Fear\n\nDonald Trump makes for pretty good copy, even if Woodward hasn’t turned up all that much—or at least all that much beyond the book’s jaw-dropping prologue, in which Gary Cohn lifts a document (an order to withdraw from a trade agreement with South Korea that Trump was about to sign) from the president’s desk. The theme, beyond Trump’s ignorance and dishonesty, is that the deep state is real: An “administrative coup d’état” has been carried out by Trump’s Cabinet and staff to contradict the president’s constitutional authority. For instance, when Trump tells James Mattis, “Let’s go in; let’s kill the fucking lot of them” after a Syrian chemical attack, Mattis hangs up and tells an aide, “We’re not going to do any of that.”\n\nIt’s also just super dishy. Trump says H.R. McMaster dresses like a “beer salesman.” Jared Kushner tells Steve Bannon of his father-in-law, “He doesn’t have a lot of cash.” Trump asks Kellyanne Conway, before offering her the job as his campaign manager, “Are you willing to not see your kids for a few months?” We go deep inside the Rex Tillerson “fucking moron” meeting at the Pentagon. An image of Trump’s handwriting—the words “TRADE IS BAD” on a speech he’s revising—is reproduced.\n\nAt the same time, you can tell that this one was put together on deadline. Woodward’s books are often most interesting when he inserts himself as a character and reveals his reportorial decision-making and the Post’s newsroom deliberations alongside the White House dope. In Fear, those moments of journalistic drama are replaced with moments in which Woodward reveals observations he made during his appearances on Fox News Sunday.\n\n13. The Agenda\n\nWhen I first read this book almost 25 years ago, I loved it. Clinton’s purple rages! Long-term interest rates! A surprise cameo by Atul Gawande!\n\nOK, I only noticed the Gawande cameo upon rereading it. We’ve got all the materials here for a great Woodward book—characters who are still historically important, and in ways (like Hillary Clinton) that weren’t fully grasped at the time. But while the passage of Clinton’s deficit-reduction plan in his first year in office was undeniably important, from the perspective of 2018 it feels like an odd choice for a book about Bill Clinton (not that Woodward could have known that in 1994). Also, there’s way too much David Boren.\n\nStill, The Agenda begins with a strikingly intimate scene, with Hillary and Bill Clinton seemingly in bed on an Arkansas morning in 1991, discussing why now is the time for Bill to run for the presidency. He describes James Carville nicely (“a bald, pointy head and riveting, almost sinister eyes”). There’s Quality Cursing (Bill Clinton: “You mean to tell me that the success of the program and my reelection hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders?”). The climax is striking, as Warren Buffett calls Bob Kerrey, the Democratic senator from Nebraska, to recommend that he vote for Clinton’s deficit-reduction plan.\n\nFrom a post-presidential viewpoint, here’s the most memorable quote in The Agenda: “If I don’t get health care done,” Clinton says, “I’ll wish I didn’t run for president.”\n\n12. The Commanders\n\nThis Bush at War prequel feels like the first time Woodward settled on the form he describes as “somewhere between newspaper journalism and history.” He set out to write a book about the Pentagon, presumably one that would resemble Veil, his book about the Central Intelligence Agency. The invasions of Panama and Iraq changed his approach, and his deadline. The main characters are Dick Cheney, then the defense secretary, and Colin Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the knowledge that the two men will be linked again in 20 years adds to the story’s salience.\n\n“This book is not about most of the things the military does,” Woodward writes of his method. “It is not about weapons procurement, defense budget fights, recruiting, training or military field exercises. With a few brief exceptions, it does not touch on the way the military has actually fought the wars of the last few years. It will not take you into the helicopters descending on Panama City, or to the desert tank battles in Iraq and Kuwait. It is above all a book about how the United States decides to fight its wars before shots are fired. The main setting is Washington, and the main action is the tug-and-pull among the players in the military decision-making process, both inside and outside the Pentagon.”\n\n11. The Last of the President’s Men\n\nA memoir of Alexander Butterfield, the Nixon aide who disclosed the existence of the president’s Oval Office taping system to the Senate Watergate Committee, this book is most notable for documenting what a weirdo Nixon was.\n\nIt also includes Woodward’s favorite Nixon White House anecdote, which appears in multiple books: Staff assistants in the Nixon White House were called “Higbys,” after Larry Higby, chief of staff H.R. Haldeman’s executive assistant. Eventually, Higby gets his own Higby, who becomes known as “Higby’s Higby.”\n\nButterfield is essentially hired as “Haldeman’s Haldeman,” but spends his early days hiding from Nixon, who is so introverted he won’t look at or speak to Butterfield for days. “If the president comes in, you just walk out,” Haldeman tells Butterfield. “It’ll spook him if he sees you.”\n\nIn an echo of a moment in All the President’s Men, Woodward calls Henry Kissinger at one point to talk about a Nixon memo acknowledging years of bombing “failure” in Southeast Asia. “That is true,” Kissinger says, before adding, “Now, you’re not going to quote me on this, are you?”\n\nWoodward writes, “Yes, I said I would.”\n\n10. Wired\n\nA book about comedy, drugs and rock ’n’ roll by an author who seems to understand none of them. Three decades later, Woodward’s idea of an au courant pop-culture reference is still Dynasty (in Fear) or Columbo (in The War Within). Woodward now describes Wired as a book about “the Hollywood drug culture,” and that’s probably a more accurate description of it than a biography of John Belushi, even if Belushi’s life is the window into that culture. A reader of Wired might wonder if Belushi was ever funny or charming, or why people kept hiring him—at Second City, on Saturday Night Live, for movies like Animal House and The Blues Brothers—if he was so unreliable and unpleasant to work with. You start to understand why, say, Nixon’s admirers resent the attention paid to Watergate at the exclusion of all else. But as a chronicle of one man’s addiction, with lots of bold-faced names—Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro are in the story of the night of Belushi’s death—this is quite a read.\n\n9. The War Within\n\nThe fourth Bush at War book could use more Dick Cheney. And like Shakespeare, Woodward’s tragedies tend to be better than the comedies. This one doesn’t end with a marriage, but it’s the best good-news Woodward book, the story of how David Petraeus and George W. Bush salvaged the Iraq war with the “surge” from 2006 to 2008.\n\nYet Woodward also uses this book to meditate on why the war went so wrong for so long. “The president and his team had become marketers of Bush’s certainty,” he writes. Rumsfeld sits in his office “trying to control the world through his snowflakes,” his short and constant Pentagon memos. Rummy seems to think that war is like welfare, that too much American security will “create a dependency among the Iraqis.” Colin Powell unloads for 20 minutes on the Iraq Study Group about the war-planning mistakes of Gen. Tommy Franks.\n\nWoodward writes, with unusual directness, “I have never doubted the sincerity of the president’s convictions. But convictions alone are not enough.” He concludes that Bush spent “three years in denial” about the Iraq war, that he was “intolerant” of confrontation and debate, and that he “engaged in the war rhetorically but maintained an odd detachment from its management.”\n\n8. The Secret Man\n\nThis is minor Woodward, but it’s incredibly enjoyable. Much of the first half reads like the footnotes to All the President’s Men. But it’s also the closest thing Woodward has written to a memoir, beginning with his first meeting with Mark Felt in the White House when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant. He discloses when he broke the rules of his agreement with Felt, including when he described him as “Deep Throat” in All the President’s Men. He admits to lying to a Post colleague, Richard Cohen, to wave him off the scent when Cohen was about to publish a column nailing Felt as Woodward’s source. It’s probably the best window we have into who Woodward is as a person and how he thinks. Plus, Nixon seems extra-weird—if not quite as weird as in The Last of the President’s Men—and Woodward quotes Kant.\n\n7. Shadow\n\nRichard Nixon is the Kilgore Trout of the Woodward literary corpus, a recurring character who just keeps showing up. In Shadow, Woodward looks at how Watergate—especially special prosecutors and independent counsels—affected the five presidents after Nixon, from Ford to Clinton. The Watergate metaphor is strained at times, and Woodward underplays the legacy of Gary Hart in the presidency of Bill Clinton, but there are lots of good stories here, including the time Jimmy Carter lied to Woodward and Ben Bradlee, and a powerfully sad post-presidential deposition of Ronald Reagan, who can’t remember anything and says, “It’s like I wasn’t president at all.”\n\n6. State of Denial\n\nA merciless recounting of the postwar planning—and lack thereof—undertaken by Donald Rumsfeld’s Pentagon, as well as a fuller chronicle of George W. Bush’s rise and fall. The four Bush at War books repeat some material, even sentences and what feel like paragraphs. You get the feeling that just as the administration kept trying to get the war right, Woodward kept returning to the story, trying to get a fuller, more complete picture. In the end, he wrote three books just on Iraq—Plan of Attack, State of Denial, and The War Within. This is the story’s second act, when everything looks as bad as it will ever get. It’s The Empire Strikes Back of Woodward’s Iraq trilogy.\n\n5. The Choice\n\nDisclosure: I’m from Kansas. The pleasure of recognition I get when Bob Dole says “Jiminy” (my dad would say “Jiminy Cricket”), or when he uses “visit” as a verb that means “sit and talk,” may lead you not to trust me on the merits of The Choice. This is the book, after all, that inspired Joan Didion to fillet Woodward in the New York Review of Books as a writer of “political pornography,” of “books in which memorable cerebral activity is virtually absent.”\n\nIf The Choice is pornography, all right then I’ll go to hell. If this book were written by Michael Lewis or Mark Leibovich, it would be regarded as a campaign classic. Hillary Clinton communes with Eleanor Roosevelt in the White House, and Bob Dole spends so much time talking to Woodward that even Woodward runs out of questions. Joe Lieberman (!) describes the arrival of Dick Morris in the White House as an “act of God” that will save the Democratic Party. And the cast includes not just Clinton and Dole but important later figures like Cheney, Powell and Hillary Clinton. George Will comes across as the George Conway of the 1990s, writing a column titled “Good Man … Wrong Job?” about Dole, the candidate for whom his wife, Mari, works as an adviser and speechwriter.\n\nYou should know there’s basically nothing about Ken Starr or Whitewater. You have to read Shadow for that. The only time the word “blowjob” appears in a book that covers the period when Bill Clinton met an intern in the Oval Office is when Scott Reed, Dole’s campaign manager, complains about Colin Powell getting “blowjob interviews” from the press.\n\n4. Veil\n\nLike The Brethren, Veil is very disconnected, bouncing from Nicaragua to Lebanon to Russia to Libya, but it’s tied together by the person of Ronald Reagan’s CIA director, Bill Casey, and the backdrop of Iran-Contra—as well as the reader’s knowledge that 9/11 is coming, which recontextualizes many of the events in the Middle East. As with All the President’s Men, Woodward is a character in the drama, and Ben Bradlee shows up, too, as the two journalists clash with Casey on what should be reported and when.\n\nWhen this book came out, some were skeptical that Woodward actually snuck into Casey’s hospital bed for a final interview—a near-deathbed confession that pays off much better than the interview he seeks with a dying Mark Felt, who suffers from dementia, in The Secret Man. I’ve read too much Woodward by now to be skeptical. Like Casey, “I believed.”\n\n3. Bush at War\n\nMy recollection of the reception of this book about the first 100 days after 9/11—a reputation that Woodward gets modestly defensive about in The War Within—is that it was a puff piece. But reading it now, George W. Bush comes off as the same president he is in the sequels: resolute but impatient and uninformed, with an administration riven by a conflict between Powell and Rumsfeld, who begins agitating for war with Iraq from the very start. This is my vote for “the best since The Final Days,” a riveting, novelistic account of a crucial moment in history. Is it the whole story? Of course not. It is, as Woodward concedes, “an inside account, largely the story as the insiders saw it, heard it and lived it.” Still, needs more Cheney.\n\n2. The Final Days\n\nThere’s a reason reviewers so often seem to be proclaiming that the latest Woodward book is “his best since The Final Days.” This book, the second of the two that were co-written by Carl Bernstein, is fantastic, the model for all that came after. Also, it helps that it’s about the only president to resign. As we said at the outset, if you’re going to be a fly, it helps to have a good wall.\n\nPlus, the ending now reads like a post-credits scene for the beginning of the rest of the Woodward cinematic universe, as newly minted President Gerald Ford writes one word on a memo, recommending his new chief of staff: “Rumsfeld.”\n\n1. All the President’s Men\n\nIt opens like a thriller, with burglars in a courtroom—one of whom soon discloses that he works for the CIA. All the President’s Men is a true crime story and also a newsroom drama, and the knowledge that Mark Felt was Deep Throat makes the book more interesting, not less, as it makes it easier to weigh Felt’s knowledge and his motivations. The elimination of what used to be the book’s central mystery also shifts the reader’s focus from Who Is Deep Throat? to Holy Cow, Two Metro Reporters Are Taking Down a President.

The red-white-and-blue “Cynthia for NY” cards on a table by the entrance did double duty as makeshift personal fans — a necessary relief in the muggy space.\n\nJamilah Lemieux, a prominent black writer Nixon hired as an adviser in July, introduced Nixon and conducted a 10-minute discussion with her about addressing black maternal mortality and racial justice more broadly. It was a way of acquainting black women with a progressive insurgent who desperately needs their votes and wants them to know she cares about the issues that matter most to them.\n\nIt seems to me the question should be, ‘Why isn’t racial justice at the center of every campaign?’ Cynthia Nixon\n\nThe conversation had its fair share of predictable crowd pleasers. When Lemieux asked why racial justice was “at the center” of Nixon’s campaign, Nixon replied, “It seems to me the question should be, ‘Why isn’t racial justice at the center of every campaign?’” The audience applauded.\n\nBut at other times, Nixon navigated the tricky waters of intersectional politics with fluency. She was well versed enough in policy to appreciate — and note repeatedly — that the higher rates of black maternal and infant mortality cannot be explained by disproportionate incidence of poverty among black people. Although income and education influence outcomes, racial disparities persist within categories: A baby born to a black woman with an advanced degree is about as likely to die as a baby born to a white woman with an eighth-grade education.\n\nAnd in New York City alone, black women are more than 12 times as likely as white women to die as a result of pregnancy, Nixon said, prompting audible gasps and a cry of “Jesus” from the audience.\n\n“That’s not just a crisis. That’s an epidemic,” she said.\n\nNixon did not offer much in the way of new policy prescriptions. In a rare bit of détente, she praised the work of her primary opponent — Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) — on the issue and promised to expand on it. In April he announced the creation of a maternal mortality task force to improve outcomes and a review board to examine the causes of every maternal death.\n\nBut the event was significant because of what it represented: A white, unabashedly left-wing candidate holding an event on an issue of particular importance to black women; pointing the finger at institutional racism, rather than class divisions; and showing her willingness to listen to black women.\n\nIn fact, after Nixon spoke, she literally took to the floor for a panel discussion of four reproductive justice experts who answered questions about black women’s health and racial disparities in health care from Lemieux and women in the audience. Photos of her seated humbly on the ground to listen to the panel went viral on social media.\n\nI wanna vote for the gubernatorial candidate that will sit on the floor and listen to black women speak about reproductive health for POC. #CynthiaForNY pic.twitter.com/oNDhNXUQZr — Nadya (@NadyaStevens) August 15, 2018\n\nThe event reflected a defining characteristic of Nixon’s underdog bid: Relentlessly courting voters in New York’s communities of color, which play a pivotal role in the state’s Democratic primaries.\n\nThe failure of progressive outsiders to break through in the urban black demographic in particular has prevented them from gaining a stronger foothold in New York politics and across the country.\n\nIn 2014, when Fordham University law professor and anti-corruption activist Zephyr Teachout challenged Cuomo from the left, she performed unexpectedly well upstate, enabling her to pick up more than one-third of the primary vote on a shoestring budget. Had Cuomo not racked up such high margins in the more diverse area in and around New York City, Teachout might have been able to unseat him.\n\nNixon’s outreach to voters of color, particularly in New York City, aims to win over these voters — or at least limit her losses — in a way that Teachout and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost New York’s 2016 Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton, never managed to do.\n\nIn addition to Lemieux, Nixon hired Brooklyn NAACP President L. Joy Williams as a senior adviser and made racial equality — in criminal justice, education and housing policy — key themes of her campaign.\n\nThe theme of the event was ‘listening to black women,’ and I think she gets that. Tanisha Green\n\nIt’s a strategy that has been apparent in Nixon’s itinerary as well as her rhetoric. Nixon kicked off her campaign at a black church in Brooklyn’s Brownsville neighborhood in March; the day after the maternal mortality panel, she joined Jumaane Williams, a city councilman running for lieutenant governor, at an event rolling out her universal rent control plan in central Brooklyn’s heavily African-American Ebbets Field public housing development. And when championing marijuana legalization, Nixon is fond of noting that the drug is already “effectively legal for white people.”\n\nNixon’s message appears to resonate with those who hear it — not least, many of the black women who braved the heat to hear her speak in Bedford-Stuyvesant.\n\nTanisha Green, a nursing assistant and psychology doctoral student, had already decided she was not voting for Cuomo when she entered the Ancient Light Studio that day. Among other grievances, she was frustrated that the strict eligibility rules of the two-term governor’s supposedly free college program precluded her son from attending the State University of New York at Purchase tuition-free.\n\nNixon, however, still had to earn Green’s vote — and by the end of the event, the former “Sex and the City” star had.\n\n“The theme of the event was ‘listening to black women,’ and I think she gets that,” Green said. “I don’t know if she always got that, but I think that she gets that it’s not just lip service — you really have to listen to us and include us.”\n\nNixon’s stands for the elimination of cash bail and other criminal justice reforms has also earned her the support of black civil rights activist Akeem Browder. His brother Kalief Browder took his own life at 22, after three years awaiting trial in jail on Rikers Island, most of it in solitary confinement.\n\n(Cuomo, by contrast, has backed ending cash bail only for select crimes.)\n\nBut there are still precious few signs that Nixon has made a dent in Cuomo’s support with black voters, let alone in the primary electorate at large. On Monday the final public poll before the Sept. 13 election showed Cuomo leading Nixon statewide by 41 percentage points. Cuomo held his biggest lead among black primary voters, 84 percent of whom said they planned to vote for him.\n\nIt’s an advantage that has contributed to Cuomo’s lead inside the vote-rich borders of New York City, where he is ahead by 50 points.\n\n“These polls talk to very few black voters,” said Nixon campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt. “They tend to make up just 20 percent of a sample of 500 voters — so the margin of error within that even smaller sample of black voters is huge. Given that the polls in general have been pretty off this year, it’s hard to put any stock in that.”\n\nLucas Jackson / Reuters Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (left) celebrates with his father, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, after winning a second term on Nov. 4, 2014.\n\nAn Incumbent With A Popular Father\n\nThe same powers of incumbency that have helped Cuomo with the broader electorate have solidified his hold on the black electorate. He has raised $36.5 million, which enables him to build on already widespread name recognition through television ads. Nixon, by contrast, has raised a mere $2.5 million, effectively putting TV airtime out of reach.\n\nAnd when Cuomo has visited predominantly black neighborhoods in New York since the start of the campaign, he has brought the power of the purse strings with him. At a press conference in Brownsville in July, he touted plans for 32 new community health centers in central Brooklyn. On Wednesday he went to the site of an old landfill on Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn to announce increased state investment in the forthcoming development there of what will be the largest state park in New York City. The park, he revealed on Wednesday, is to be named after Shirley Chisholm, a central Brooklynite who became the nation’s first black congresswoman in 1968 and ran for president in 1972.\n\nThanks to Cuomo’s influence and well-earned reputation for vindictiveness, Jumaane Williams is one of only two black elected officials in the state — along with Tiffany Garriga, a town council member from Hudson — to endorse Nixon.\n\nCuomo is running on a slate with New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, a candidate for attorney general who would be the first black woman to serve in that role in any state in the country.\n\nHoping for a similar boost, Nixon has run on a ticket with Williams, who shares her progressive ideology. There are some indications though, that voters — and key validators like The New York Times ― are assessing their candidacies independently.\n\nRegina Wheelock, a retired school safety officer, attended the Nixon-Williams rally at Ebbets Field Houses, where she lives. Wheelock said she plans to vote for Williams, whom she remembers from his youth, but still has to do more research on Nixon.\n\nLike Williams, Andrew Cuomo is more of a known entity for Wheelock. “I knew his father,” she said, referring to former Gov. Mario Cuomo. “I never was a political person, but his father spoke at my graduation.”\n\nBlack people have a reasonable relationship with the Cuomos ― him and his dad. Leah Daughtry\n\nAndrew Cuomo enjoys the support of many black voters who had a warm relationship with his late father.\n\n“Black people have a reasonable relationship with the Cuomos ― him and his dad,” said Leah Daughtry, an African-American pastor and Democratic Party official from Brooklyn, who recalled her father’s friendship with Mario Cuomo. She has not publicly endorsed anyone in the race, but she added, “It’s hard for me to conceive of not voting for Andrew, because of the familial relationship.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest obstacle to Nixon’s campaign is her lack of experience at a time when Democratic primary voters are furious about that flaw in President Donald Trump.\n\nNick Haby, a marketing professional and LGBT rights activist who runs her canvassing operation in Astoria, said that the Nixon skeptics he has met often unfavorably link her celebrity and the president’s.\n\n“We don’t want to try that again,” they say, according to Haby, who tries his best to convince them otherwise.\n\nRobert Green, who was impressed with a speech Nixon gave at St. Luke’s A.M.E. Church in Harlem on Sunday morning, had a different but related concern. His mother was close to the elder Cuomo, and Green said he is leaning toward voting for Andrew Cuomo on Thursday. Given Nixon’s lack of political experience, he said he had his doubts about her ability to stand up to the president.", "name": "Cynthia Nixon Needs Black Voters. She's Trying.

It’s a classic racist caricature: Williams appears as a hulk-like figure with unkempt hair and large lips reminiscent of the minstrel or the mammy.\n\nBehind Williams is her competitor, Naomi Osaka. Her appearance has been distilled down to its lowest-common-denominator characteristics: light skin, slim frame, blonde hair. She might as well be Maria Sharapova.\n\nCaricatures, by their nature, are meant to distort and exaggerate. But they’re also meant to be symbolic, representative; short-hand for a concept or idea.\n\nHere, the narrative is clear: Williams has been cast as the big, ugly, angry black woman. Osaka, by contrast, has been cast as the innocent white girl, even though she’s not even white.\n\n“It had nothing to do with gender or race.”\n\n\n\nHerald Sun backs Mark Knight’s cartoon on Serena Williams: https://t.co/i1NBGO8xJw pic.twitter.com/BTFONVWHh8 — Herald Sun (@theheraldsun) September 10, 2018\n\nMany tennis fans have pointed out that Carlos Ramos’ petty umpiring robbed both Williams and Osaka of what should have been a far less controversial match. But Osaka was robbed of something else: her agency, her identity, her story, and her blackness.\n\nIn interviews, Osaka has been adamant about embracing both her Asian and black heritages, conceding that while she represents Japan in sporting events, she doesn’t identify solely as Japanese. She proudly reps her Haitian side.\n\nYet Osaka’s biracial identity is inconvenient in a racist narrative that turns Williams into a stereotype. It’s more expedient to focus on all the things about her that aren’t stereotypically black: her light skin, her soft-spoken nature, her tear-filled apology after winning the match. In this way, Osaka is framed if not as a white woman, then as a more acceptable and palatable version of blackness ― as the type of black person that doesn’t make you acknowledge their blackness.\n\nBut there are actually two narratives at play here. There’s the one in which Osaka is reduced to a silent and silenced victim; tearful; not quite white, but not black either. Reporters ask her whether Williams’s “behavior” made Osaka lose respect for her, reinforcing coded stereotypes that have everything to do with colorism, model minority myths and the culture’s implicit hatred of black women like Serena Williams.\n\nAnd then there’s this other, opposing, well-meaning narrative that paints Williams as a feminist crusader, fighting for women’s rights and against double standards in a sport that most definitely has treated her unfairly on the basis of both race and gender in the past.\n\nIn the case of her match with Osaka on Saturday, Williams’ actions, the way she broke that racket, the way she demanded respect from the umpire, all serve to remind people of all the times she was forced to smile and grit her teeth at arbitrary clothing regulations, or frequent random drug tests, or racist slurs and boos from certain tennis audiences.\n\nI’ve struggled with this narrative, too, because while it is important and valid in so many respects, it’s also an oversimplification of what happened during that match.\n\nBecause what happened during the match wasn’t solely political. It was deeply personal. It was human drama played out for millions of people. It was bigger than any narratives we can thrust upon it. The cartoon, the headlines ― they’re all in keeping with a consistent and collective inability in the culture to see black women as complex and capable of expressing myriad emotions, from rage to joy to despair. Or to allow two black women to reach for excellence at the same time.\n\nKnight’s cartoon is what happens when we flatten whole human beings into types, when the story and its narratives become far more important than the nuance. In the process, racist and sexist assumptions are perpetuated and we strip people of their right to be weak and strong, of the totality of their humanity.\n\nHere is the bottom line: On Saturday, two talented tennis players ― one black, one Japanese and black ― played a deeply emotional game, and those emotions came brimming to the surface for a whole host of reasons.\n\nBut it wasn’t a matter of villain and victim, good and bad, black and white. Williams is an icon, a legend. And she’s a fallible and whole human being. Just as Osaka is more than just Japanese, more than tearful and endearingly apologetic. She’s a fierce competitor with a distinct personal history, not a symbol of acceptable blackness to weaponize against Williams.\n\nIndeed, she is many things, but what perhaps matters most is who she sees herself as, especially on the court:\n\n“I’m just a tennis player playing another tennis player,” Osaka explained after she accepted her trophy.", "name": "The Whitewashing Of Naomi Osaka", "description": "The U.S. Open tennis champion's biracial identity is inconvenient in a racist narrative that turns Serena Williams into a stereotype.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-whitewashing-of-naomi-osaka_us_5b967eb3e4b0cf7b004209b5", "id": "7e7c066fe98651d7940395ae6f8623e75fc18901", "keywords": ["white", "women", "tennis", "cartoon", "match", "narrative", "black", "racist", "whitewashing", "osaka", "naomi", "williams"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T11:16:52-04:00"}

That’s Nuts. Let’s make one thing absolutely clear: The polygraph is not a lie-detector test.\n\nSince Wednesday afternoon, when the New York Times published an incendiary op-ed by an anonymous senior Trump administration official—one in which the author admits to “working diligently from within to frustrate parts of [the president’s] agenda and his worst inclinations”—the White House has been in a panicked hunt for its author.\n\nThe op-ed could scarcely have come at a worse time for the White House, where hackles were already raised over the contents of Bob Woodward’s newest book, Fear, which paints a portrait of an unstable president out of his intellectual depth and surrounded to some degree by aides who have to work day and night to prevent him from engaging in reckless and destructive behavior.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn order to track down the members of what the Times op-ed termed the “steady state”—that is, senior aides who keep in check a president they view as erratic but whom they are enabling in order to achieve their own policy objectives—Senator Rand Paul recently raised the prospect of subjecting everyone in the White House who holds a security clearance to a polygraph examination in order to root out leakers—even those who share unclassified information.\n\nWe have a combined 30-plus years of experience handling issues surrounding the polygraph, including past congressional testimony on the topic. Relying upon that experience, we can say with considerable confidence that Sen. Paul’s proposal is ridiculous, completely counterproductive and sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nLet’s make one thing absolutely clear: The polygraph is not a lie-detector test. It does not determine if you are telling the truth. The examiner reviewing the readings from the polygraph cannot determine if you are telling the truth. No matter how much Hollywood might try to convince you otherwise, the polygraph is not a mechanized version of truth serum.\n\nThe polygraph is merely a device that evaluates various physiological reactions your body makes when answering questions. It measures your heart rate, respiration and perspiration, among other things. Examiners are trained how to “read between the lines” in terms of what those measurements may suggest about the truthfulness of your answers. If their interpretation of the readings suggests deception, the examiners are further trained in how to coax individuals into subsequently divulging more information in order to “put their mind at ease” so that their reactions will be lessened. Polygraph examiners are skillful and trained interrogators, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nAs part of our law practice, we represent contractors and federal employees working across the intelligence and law enforcement communities who have run into problems with the polygraph. We routinely have to address the fallout of alleged “admissions” made by our clients during polygraph sessions and which are subsequently used as the basis for personnel or security clearance proceedings.\n\nThere are two primary circumstances in which the federal government commonly uses polygraph examinations: one is for the security clearance-screening of individuals being considered for access to classified information (most agencies using polygraphs deal with Sensitive Compartmented Information, some of the government’s most sensitive secrets); and the other is in a more narrow situation where specific allegations of misconduct have been levied against an existing employee or contractor. In both situations, the polygraph is often just one of several investigative tools used to gather relevant and material information.\n\nIt is virtually unheard of to do what Sen. Paul is suggesting: submitting entire offices, departments or agencies to a categorical polygraph screening merely to root out a “mole,” and it would undoubtedly be counterproductive.\n\nMoreover, there is no reason to believe that it would even work as intended. History is littered with actual moles and spies working for years within the U.S. government despitebeing subjected to polygraph examinations. Aldrich Ames and Ana Belen Montes, convicted spies who committed espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union and Cuba, respectively, were able to “pass” polygraph examinations on multiple occasions during their careers in the government. The Department of Justice has itself argued before the Supreme Court that polygraph evidence should be inadmissible in court due to its inaccuracy. Government polygraph experts also acknowledge the existence of false positives (innocent people suggesting guilt) and false negatives (guilty people displaying innocence), calling into question any obtained results.\n\nIt is certainly possible that such a broad polygraph screening would find some leakers. People inevitably crack under pressure, and it is plausible that some subjects would admit to leaking information. But there is no particular scientific basis or reason to believe that it would be the actual leakers the screening was designed to find.\n\nIn the meantime, the entire charade would severely disrupt White House operations and morale, especially if certain senior individuals— such as Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Kellyanne Conway and John Kelly, to name a few—were exempted from the screening (or any punishment for admissions they might make during it).\n\nThe president routinely denounces the ongoing Russia probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as a “witch hunt.” But a broad polygraph screening of the White House would truly be a “witch hunt.” Yes, it might find some peripheral “witches,” but would be unlikely to locate the true perpetrators, and in the meantime, it will have been an incredible misuse of resources.\n\nHumanity has always found the idea of a tool that compels people to be honest compelling. It’s no coincidence that Wonder Woman, who wields a “lasso of truth,” was created by William Moulton Marston, a man who invented an early prototype of the polygraph. But treating the latter like it’s the former is pure fantasy.\n\nBradley P. Moss is a partner at the Washington, D.C. Law Office of Mark S.

And if one of the candidates is running a grass-roots campaign, in which personal engagement is decisive, accurate early polling becomes even harder.\n\n“The engagement comes late, the paid communication comes late, so what happens in the last two or three weeks matters a lot,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. “If there’s a heavily grass-roots campaign, the impact of that is going to be felt really close to Election Day and on Election Day.”", "name": "Primary Season Was Full of Surprises.

The court has 123 state parties that recognize its jurisdiction.\n\nBolton's speech, on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attack, came as an ICC judge was expected to soon announce a decision on a request from prosecutors to formally open an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed by Afghan national security forces, Taliban and Haqqani network militants and U.S. forces and intelligence in Afghanistan since May 2003. The accusations against U.S. personnel include torture and illegal imprisonment.\n\n\"The International Criminal Court unacceptably threatens American sovereignty and U.S. national security interests,\" Bolton told the Federalist Society, a conservative Washington-based think tank.\n\nBolton also took aim at Palestinian efforts to press war crime charges against Israel for its policies in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza.\n\nHe said the U.S. would use \"any means necessary\" to protect Americans and citizens of allied countries, like Israel, \"from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court.\" The White House said that to the extent permitted by U.S. law, the Trump administration would ban ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the United States, sanction their funds in the U.S. financial system and prosecute them in the U.S. criminal system.\n\n\"We will not cooperate with the ICC,\" Bolton said, adding that \"for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us.\"\n\nIn response, the court issued a statement Tuesday saying it was \"an independent and impartial judicial institution\" created to \"ensure accountability for crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.\"\n\nThe court said it prosecuted cases only when those states fail to do so or did not do so \"genuinely.\"\n\nIt pledged to \"continue to do its work undeterred, in accordance with those principles and the overarching idea of the rule of law.\"\n\nBolton's speech was an extraordinary rebuke decried by human rights groups that complained it was another Trump administration rollback of U.S. leadership in demanding accountability for gross abuses.\n\n\"Any U.S. action to scuttle ICC inquiries on Afghanistan and Palestine would demonstrate that the administration was more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers — and deflecting scrutiny of U.S. conduct in Afghanistan — than supporting impartial justice,\" said Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several people who claim they were detained and tortured in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2008 and could be victims or witnesses in any ICC prosecution, said Bolton's threats were \"straight out of an authoritarian playbook.\"\n\n\"This misguided and harmful policy will only further isolate the United States from its closest allies and give solace to war criminals and authoritarian regimes seeking to evade international accountability,\" the ACLU said.\n\nIran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, slammed the U.S. opposition on Tuesday.\n\n\"The U.S. threatens to impose sanctions on the ICC & even prosecute its judges in American courts. Where is the outrage?\" he wrote on his Twitter account. \"The boorishness of this rogue US regime seems to know no bounds. When will the international community say enough is enough & force US to act like a normal state?\"\n\nSince its creation, the court has filed charges against dozens of suspects including former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed by rebels before he could be arrested, and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is accused of charges including genocide in Darfur. Al-Bashir remains at large, as does Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, who was among the first rebels charged by the court in 2005. The court has convicted just eight defendants.\n\nThe court has been hobbled by the refusal of the U.S., Russia, China and other major nations to join. Others have quit: Burundi and the Philippines, whose departure, announced earlier this year, takes effect next March.\n\nThe Clinton administration in 2000 signed the Rome Statute that created the ICC but had serious reservations about the scope of the court's jurisdiction and never submitted it for ratification to the Senate, where there was broad bipartisan opposition to what lawmakers saw as a threat to U.S. sovereignty.\n\nWhen George W. Bush took office in 2001, his administration promoted and passed the American Service Members Protection Act, which sought to immunize U.S. troops from potential prosecution by the ICC. In 2002, Bolton, then a State Department official, traveled to New York to ceremonially \"unsign\" the Rome Statute at the United Nations.\n\nBush's first administration then embarked on a diplomatic drive to get countries who were members of the ICC to sign so-called Article 98 agreements that would bar those nations from prosecuting Americans before the court under penalty of sanctions. The administration was largely successful in its effort, getting more than 100 countries to sign the agreements. Some of those, however, have not been formally ratified.\n\nIn Bush's second term, the U.S. attitude toward the ICC shifted slightly as the world looked on in horror at genocide being committed in Sudan's western Darfur region. The administration did not oppose and offered limited assistance to an ICC investigation in Darfur.\n\nThe Obama administration expanded that cooperation, offering additional support to the ICC as it investigated the then-Uganda-based Lord's Resistance Army and its top leadership, including Kony.\n\nOn Monday, Bolton effectively turned Washington's back on the court, accusing it of corruption and inefficiency. Above all, he took aim at the court's view that citizens of nonmember states are subject to its jurisdiction.\n\n\"The ICC is an unprecedented effort to vest power in a supranational body without the consent of either nation-states or the individuals over which it purports to exercise jurisdiction,\" Bolton said. \"It certainly has no consent whatsoever from the United States.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, contributed to this report.", "name": "Bolton: International Criminal Court 'already dead to us'", "description": "America's long-running reluctant relationship with the International Criminal Court came to a crashing halt on Monday as decades of U.S. suspicions about the tribunal and its global jurisdiction spilled into open hostility, amid threats of sanctions if it investigates U.S. troops in Afghanistan.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/09/11/bolton-international-criminal-court-is-already-dead-to-us.html", "id": "013e49e766655de1e4a6bbda14d417a5b3806fe6", "keywords": ["dead", "court", "international", "crimes", "icc", "war", "states", "bolton", "criminal", "administration", "american", "united"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

These candidates, propelled to service by a sense of duty, anger and resolve, are now putting their military service at the forefront of their campaigns and rewriting the way Democrats talk about the War on Terror.\n\nNational Democrats, sensing a prime opportunity to retake the House in 2018, have intentionally turned to veterans and service-focused candidates in November. A slew of super PACs aimed at nurturing these candidates, some who have no political experience at all, have formed and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has financially backed a number, too.\n\nThe effort is reminiscent of a similar strategy employed in 2006 by then-DCCC chairman Rahm Emanuel, who recruited and backed veterans in a series of close races. But this year it comes at a time when voters, in the eyes of political operatives, are deeply skeptical of cookie-cutter politicians and searching for unique nominees who break the mold.\n\nIn the past 17 years, dozens of lawmakers and political candidates from both parties have cited the events of 9/11 as an inspiring reason for seeking public office. But Democratic operatives have actively sought out and supported veterans running in recent years to help spotlight compelling candidates and bolster Democratic national security credentials, a significant development for a party in which many opposed the Iraq War and have criticized military involvement overseas.\n\nThen-US Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for International Security Affairs Elissa Slotkin appears before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on \"Terrorist March in Iraq: The U.S. Response.\" in July 2014 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.

Bruce Poliquin in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, ran an ad earlier this year tracing the history of his life from the point he decided to join the Marines, and on Monday he released a spot that featured him firing a rifle.\n\n\"When I joined the Marines after 9/11, I knew it would be tough,\" said in the ad. \"But coming home was hard work, too.\"\n\nAnd Jason Crow, a Democrat running in Colorado, is using a similar strategy, running an spot titled \"Serve\" that highlights his history of working construction in college before joining the Army after September 11, 2001.\n\n\"9/11 happened and I couldn't ask people that I knew to do my fighting for me,\" he says over images of his time in Afghanistan and Iraq. Crow has also suspended any campaigning on Tuesday.\n\nAll three Democrats have complex -- and different -- views of war and terrorism, shaped by the era in which they came of age. But they are all looking to convince voters that what Washington needs is more service leadership in Congress, something they all gained because of the decisions they made after the attacks.\n\n\"I think it was quintessential moment of my generation. Everyone I know can remember where they were and who they were with and what they were doing on 9/11,\" Slotkin told CNN, comparing it to putting a man on the moon or the assassination of John F. Kennedy. \"For my generation, especially as a young professional at the time, it was a monumental, generational event and it changed my perceptive on the world, the country, what it means to serve and why we need to serve.\"\n\nThen-Maine House Assistant Majority Leader Jared Golden, left, is seen at the State House by dozens of state workers in July 2017.

But when asked to reflect on what they felt that day and the following weeks and months, most said that politics was the furthest thing from their minds.\n\nGolden was a newly enrolled college student in Maine on September 11, 2001. While he had considered military service, he was planning to become a history teacher. But after the attacks, Golden's life changed when he enlisted with the United States Marine Corps before telling his parents.\n\n\"When I was 19 years old and going to boot camp, I never dreamed I had any future in politics,\" Golden said. \"My thought was service to country, it just seemed like the right thing to do. ... I wanted to serve my country. I was upset about 9/11.\"\n\nGolden, a Democrat, added that he remembers being moved by President George W. Bush's State of the Union address in early 2002, where he outlined steps his administration would take against terror.\n\nFollowing the speech, he said, \"I made the decision to leave the university after I came across a Marine Corps table on campus.\"\n\nCrow, a Democrat running to represent suburban Colorado, was in the ROTC at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on September 11. But, in the wake of the attacks, he opted to be commissioned as an officer in the Army and serve an active duty role in the invasion of Iraq.\n\n\"At that time, I did not realize the extent to which it was going to change the trajectory of my life,\" he said. \"It impacted every American in a different way and certainly the victims and their families we have to remember the most, but it certainly changed the trajectory of my life and my service to the country and everything that has come after that can be traced to the moment in time.\"\n\nCrow, now years removed from his three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and aiming to unseat Rep. Mike Coffman -- himself a retired Marine Corps and Army veteran who served in the first Gulf War and was a civil affairs officer in Iraq in 2005 and 2006 -- said the experience changed his world view, making it clear that people are willing to sacrifice anything for the country they love.\n\nTo date, thousands of men and women have died in the War on Terror, according to the Department of Defense Casualty Report. It's those men and women, Crow said, who more impacted his view on leadership after returning home.\n\n\"I think every combat veteran wakes up every morning and there isn't a day that goes by where you don't think about those soldiers,\" he said. \"You feel an obligation to make sure that sacrifice was not made in vain.\"\n\nJason Crow, Democratic candidate for Colorado's 6th Congressional District, is interviewed at the DNC in October 2017.

I don't think every veteran is the best person for the job in Congress, nor do I think every veteran wants to,\" he said, adding that both Democrats and Republican pick up the same \"values that get driven into you in the military.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't we be better,\" he concluded, \"if our politics (were) the same?\"", "name": "Democratic candidates trace careers of service to memories of September 11, 2001", "description": "Before September 11, 2001, Elissa Slotkin was a 20-something graduate student at Columbia University with an interest in foreign affairs.

You ask him the same question?” Walker asked a reporter, pointing to the reporter’s voice recorder, then pressing: “That’s on the record, right? You’re going to ask him the same question?” (POLITICO later asked Evers’ campaign; the answer was “yes.”)\n\nWalker then responded directly about his intentions.\n\n“Of course, 100 percent. I’m running for governor, I’m going to be here for four years,” Walker said, noting he went on a statewide listening tour after he gave up his presidential ambitions. “I came back and did listening sessions in all 72 counties. It’s what influenced our budget, the changes we made in education … it all came out of us going right back to the roots.”\n\n“A lot of people have said I could have easily gone on and done something else. I could have joined the Cabinet, could have joined the public sector,” Walker said. “But instead, I’m committed to being governor.”\n\nFor all the storm clouds surrounding Walker’s prospects, few in either party are willing to write him off. As he runs for a third term, his job approval ratings remain in a fairly narrow band , never dropping too low or soaring too high.\n\nHe’s also cash-flush, given the $8.6 million Walker and the state party reported in the bank in July. On top of that, the Republican Governors Association is expected to invest $5.7 million in preserving Walker’s governorship. Walker can boast of a healthy state economy and an unemployment rate that stands at 2.9 percent — he paints Evers as beholden to unions and says an Evers victory would mean higher taxes and would stall that humming economy.\n\nWalker’s durability and resilience — he’s been running and winning tough elections since his early 20s — inspires confidence among Republicans. He’s the last man standing among a Wisconsin GOP triumvirate who ascended to national prominence in the Obama era only to see their fortunes sputter during the Trump presidency.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is not running for reelection; Reince Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chair, was ousted from his position as White House chief of staff after a chaotic six months.\n\n“I don’t think anybody thinks that this is isn’t going to be the most competitive governor’s race in the country,\" said Brandon Scholz, a Republican strategist and former Wisconsin GOP party executive director.\n\nScholz said one of Walker’s greatest assets is the strength of a Republican statewide organization that he helped build. “You see how hard Walker’s working: he’s an 8-event-a-day kind of guy. He’s always been a workhorse, all the time. He’s ramped it up even more.”\n\nRepublicans contend the Walker political machine, which features a tested field strategy and foot soldiers already in place, will combat those outside forces. They point to the contested Aug. 14 GOP Senate primary, where Leah Vukmir was vastly outspent but still defeated Kevin Nicholson. Walker didn’t endorse in the race, but his son, Alex, served as Vukmir’s political director and the GOP party apparatus went all in for her.\n\n“The fact that she won shows that the Walker organization is as powerful today as it was in 2016 when it was mobilized on behalf of Ted Cruz,” said Republican pollster Chris Wilson, who ran analytics for Nicholson’s campaign, referring to Cruz’s resounding victory over Trump in the Wisconsin presidential primary. “The only area I can speak to with any level of authority is we got our ass kicked by a ground game — a grassroots Walker organization — that will be just as energized in November.”\n\nThe import of Wisconsin’s governor’s race is not lost on either party. Toppling Walker, long a symbol of anti-union and conservative policies, would deliver an emotional windfall to the left and serve to shore up a pivotal swing state for Democrats in the runup to 2020.\n\nFor Republicans, beating back Democratic enthusiasm in a key Midwestern state Trump unexpectedly won by less than 25,000 votes in 2016, would hold just as much significance.\n\nThey expect Evers, first elected statewide as superintendent in 2009, will be at a spending disadvantage against Walker, who’s stockpiled a greater cash reserve than he did at this point in 2014.\n\nBut the cavalry is coming for Evers. The Democratic Governors Association has already committed at least $3.8 million, while other major groups expected to give resources to Evers’ campaign include former Attorney General Eric Holder’s redistricting committee, Obama’s Organizing for Action, Tom Steyer’s NextGen America and the Democratic National Committee.\n\n“I don’t think this is about Democratic enthusiasm in Madison and Milwaukee, it’s about Democratic enthusiasm and a backlash to Trump and Walker everywhere in Wisconsin,” said Sachin Chheda, a Democratic strategist and former Milwaukee County party chair.\n\nChheda points to “a massive shift to the left” in what was once solid Walker territory — including special elections in Green Bay’s Brown County and in the Twin Cities suburbs in St. Croix County.\n\nDemocrats also cite three public polls in recent weeks — NBC/Marist , Marquette and Suffolk/Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel — show independent voters are breaking from Walker, a daunting signal given that the state is almost evenly split politically, making them an essential part of the governor’s path to victory.\n\n“What all of those polls said is that independents are going for Evers over Walker by 10 points. Walker has generally won independents when he’s gotten to victory,” Chheda said.\n\nWhile Walker is expected to again win the vote-rich, GOP suburban counties outside of Milwaukee — he dominates in the so-called “WOW” counties where turnout is high — Chheda said if Democrats can nibble at the margins, it would make it much more difficult for Walker to win statewide.\n\nThe Trump factor could play a role in those suburbs. Even Republicans admit Trump’s unfiltered rants on social media and a slew of scandals hitting his inner circle could prompt GOP voters to stay home in November, including those heartened by Trump’s policies on immigration and taxes.\n\n“This guy just says and does things that make you recoil,” Scholz, the Republican consultant, said of Trump. “The balancing test there is: OK, you’ve had victories on issues that you’ve long wanted, but the guy doing them makes you want to throw up in your mouth. What do you do? Do you stay home and not vote? Or do you vote for the folks on the ticket, to make sure that what goes on for Republicans and conservatives, and what goes on in the state capitol is what you want?”\n\nOne stat with which both parties can agree is the direction rural voters are leaning, and that’s with Walker. Rural Wisconsin counties with populations of 10,000 people or less have long held steady for Walker, and neither side believes that’ll change in November.\n\n“Scott Walker and Wisconsin Republicans have earned the support of hard-working families in rural parts of the state because they've stood up for them and delivered results,” Walker senior campaign advisor Brian Reisinger said. “Democrats lost touch with those voters a long time ago, and they're not likely to win them back.”", "name": "‘Scott Walker fatigue’ haunts Republicans", "description": "Signs that the Wisconsin governor is ripe to be taken down are everywhere.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/10/scott-walker-reelection-wisconsin-governor-813442", "id": "1d4b0d2b3a7141354dbc47b2ddc42178902f7deb", "keywords": ["evers", "walkers", "scott", "fatigue", "governors", "state", "walker", "haunts", "republican", "hes", "wisconsin", "governor", "party", "republicans"], "timestamp": "2018-09-10T00:00:00"}

Giuliani is now Trump’s attorney, representing him in the special counsel investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia and whether the president obstructed justice.\n\nAs president, Trump has made measured remarks at Sept. 11 ceremonies, but he has a history of making insensitive and false comments about the tragedy.\n\nThe 2001 terrorist attacks were the subject of one of Trump’s most egregious lies during his presidential campaign.

And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down,” Trump said at a campaign rally. “Thousands of people were cheering.”\n\nThe following day, Trump reiterated his lie, claiming that the supposed celebration “was well covered at the time.”\n\n“There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down,” Trump said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nThe lie, which has been roundly debunked, appeared to originate from an article published a few days after the attacks, reporting that law enforcement officials had investigated “a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.”\n\nBut Trump, as he frequently does, exaggerated the allegation in the story ― an allegation that was never substantiated.\n\nFollowing the rally in which he first peddled the lie, Trump mocked one of the journalists who wrote the original story, veteran New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, after Kovaleski himself affirmed that the story did not back up Trump’s lie.\n\n“I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating,” Kovaleski said.\n\nIn response, Trump performed a disgusting imitation of Kovaleski, who has arthrogryposis, a congenital joint condition.\n\nOn the actual day of the attacks, Trump, a New York real estate mogul, tastelessly bragged about his downtown Manhattan building, 40 Wall Street.\n\nCalling in to a New York TV news broadcast, as the station aired footage of the World Trade Center towers collapsing, Trump claimed that his property would now become the tallest building in the area.\n\n“40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest — and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest,” he said. “And now it’s the tallest.”\n\nTrump interview on 9/11: \"[My building] was the 2nd-tallest in Manhattan...

Asiri was reported to have created undetectable bombs and experimented with implanting them inside operatives’ bodies. He had been involved in the near-miss of the “Underwear Bomber” in 2009 and had nearly succeeded in killing former Saudi counterterrorism chief Muhammad bin Nayef. Asiri had haunted the sleep of counterterrorism officials, including me, for years.\n\nYet his apparent death, which might once have been a Page 1 story, got scant coverage, with no news stories appearing in the New York Times or the Washington Post. In the lede of an op-ed he penned to note this “major counterterrorism success,” former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell wrote, “Amid all the controversies and scandals from Washington dominating our news cycle. … [Asiri’s death] did not get the attention it deserved.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOf all the unexpected developments of Donald Trump’s presidency, surely one of the more unlikely ones has been the slow but steady ebbing of the nation’s profound, at times almost boundless, fixation on the threat of terrorism.\n\nThe development is unexpected because over the 17 years since the attacks of September 11, 2001, jihadist extremism has come to dominate America’s threat landscape like nothing else since Soviet Russia did during the Cold War. What’s more, as poll after poll has shown, terrorism has been far and away the only foreign policy issue Americans care deeply about and the prism through which their sense of national security is defined.\n\nNo wonder, then, that despite the absence of any event resembling 9/11 for all those years, the sense of peril could easily be inflamed by Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign—a year-and-a-half-long carnival of fearmongering and Islamophobia. Candidate Trump promised to shut the nation’s doors to Muslims and create a national registry of those in the country, disparaged Islam for being sick at heart, and vowed to wipe out terrorists everywhere and kill their families for good measure.\n\nTrump’s no-holds barred demagoguery—building on years of political parties jousting over the terrorist threat and its related wars, media coverage that was often supersaturated, and actual attacks in California and Florida during the presidential campaign—helped drive concern over terrorism to a peak. In 2015, for the only time in a decade, terrorism tied the economy as the No. 1 concern of Americans. Fully 51 percent of those Americans polled in late 2015 said they feared they or someone in their family would be a victim of terrorist violence, and multiple surveys found large numbers of Americans saying they believed the threat was greater than at any time since 9/11. In the election, terrorism was the No. 2 issue of concern for voters, with 80 percent of voters citing it—just 4 points behind the economy.\n\nAll indications suggested that this campaign was only the beginning—that a broadened counterterrorism crusade and energized fear-fanning lay in store after the just-inaugurated Trump vowed to “unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism,” which, he promised, the world would “eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.” Indeed, the new administration immediately rolled out the first draft of the executive order blocking entry to the U.S. for citizens from seven Muslim countries. The drama of that effort played out across courtrooms from Maryland to Hawaii over 18 months and concluded with a 5-4 Supreme Court decision upholding a ban that had gone through multiple rounds of cosmetic surgery so it could pass muster with the justices.\n\nBut while the ban worked its way through the courts, it became clear that Trump had done little else to keep the focus on terrorism. He swore during the campaign that he had a secret plan for destroying ISIS, but none was ever unveiled. The fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria continued largely along the lines conceived in the Obama administration, though the Trump team removed some targeting restrictions, increasing significantly the amount of ordnance dropped and the number of civilian casualties.\n\nPerhaps most important, Trump scandals have swept away all before them, refocusing public attention on the question of campaign collusion with Russia, trade wars, chaos in the White House, attacks against the press and such contretemps as stripping former CIA chief John Brennan of his security clearance. The media, a central player in the feedback mechanism of public opinion, redirected its energies, and today only a small fraction of terrorism stories make the front page of the dailies compared with only a few years ago.\n\nAt the New York Times, star reporters with experience in intelligence and law enforcement such as Mark Mazzetti, Scott Shane and Adam Goldman have been reassigned to the Trump maelstrom. Greg Miller, the Washington Post’s stalwart terrorism and intelligence reporter, has been anchoring that paper’s book on Trump and Russia. In the endless panel discussion of Trumpian outrages that CNN has become, former CIA official Phil Mudd no longer dissects the details of jihadist plots but contextualizes White House misdeeds and vents his well-founded anger at White House shenanigans.\n\nWhile some might claim the decline in coverage reflects a decline in terrorist activity, that argument is weak: The New York City rental truck attack on October 31, 2017, that killed eight caused more fatalities than all but three incidents in the U.S. since 9/11. The attack received a fraction of the attention of earlier terrorist events.\n\nPolling gives only limited help in determining public concern today about terrorism: Most surveys on the subject are conducted right after attacks. Interestingly, there wasn’t one after the New York City incident, and there haven’t been many others of late. Gallup found in March that 40 percent of those asked were very concerned about future terrorist attacks in the U.S., a notable decline from 48 percent in 2016. (For comparison: The number in 2002, just months after 9/11 was 49 percent.)\n\nTrump himself appears to have forgotten about the subject. Talk of terrorism has virtually disappeared from his shambolic rally performances. When he spoke in Phoenix late last month, he flogged a long decomposed horse by criticizing former President Barack Obama for refusing to use the term “radical Islamic terrorists” and then boasted briefly about extreme vetting. At a late July rally in Tampa, Florida, he made no mention of the subject at all.\n\nThe lull in attention to terrorism raises questions: Is this a good thing? If so, is it durable?\n\nThe answer to the first is, on balance, yes. U.S. public opinion had become a runaway train on issue of terrorism, to the detriment of our broader interests. That’s a natural consequence of a political debate on terrorism that had lost touch with reality—as when, in 2014, Senator Lindsey Graham declared on \"Fox News Sunday,\" “I think of an American city in flames because of the terrorists’ ability to operate in Syria and Iraq.”\n\nThough partisans on both sides of the aisle take the terrorist threat seriously, Republicans tend to rate it as substantially greater concern, typically by a margin of 20 or more percentage points. In New Hampshire, where I live, 2016 Republican presidential primary candidates such as Chris Christie and Marco Rubio spoke about their determination to allay the fears about imminent attack they heard from the inhabitants in the tiny towns and villages of the state—a scenario of almost indescribable preposterousness. All of this took place in an America where the chances of being killed by a foreign terrorist were infinitesimal.\n\nWithin the government, the consequences of the terrorism fixation were also manifest. Former White House Coordinator for the Middle East Rob Malley and former State Department chief of staff Jon Finer have written in Foreign Affairs about how the counterterrorism machinery competed with—and ran afoul of—the rest of the foreign policy process in the second Obama term:\n\n\n\nIn one example from our time in government, in 2016, officials taking part in the more specialized counterterrorism side of the process debated whether to kill or capture a particular militant leader even as those involved in the parallel interagency process considered whether to initiate political discussions with him. That same year, those involved in the counterterrorism process recommended launching a major strike against ISIS leaders in Libya even as other officials working on that country worried that overt U.S. military action would undermine Libya’s fledgling government.\n\nFor the record, Malley and Finer describe a policy process far more tangled and convoluted than the one I knew in the first Obama term. Both, however, are acute observers, and I have no reason to doubt their account. It is hard to imagine that the time spent on terrorism did not also limit the administration’s bandwidth for other matters. Historians one day will undoubtedly examine whether more attention should have been paid to a Russia whose behavior had grown in a few years from episodically difficult to deeply hostile.\n\nOne important benefit of the declining obsession with terrorism is that it has allowed the biggest agency in the government, the Defense Department—which appears to have recognized U.S. over-investment in one threat area—to begin reallocating resources. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis early in the year unveiled a new National Defense Strategy in which the threat of extremist violence was replaced by “growing threats from revisionist powers as different as China and Russia.”\n\nGiven that the “high-end threat” from Al Qaeda to carry out catastrophic attacks that kill thousands (other groups like ISIS are less interested in this kind of complex covert operation and are more attracted to holding territory) appears to have been reduced by that group’s disarray, while Russia seeks to undermine the global rules-based order and China works to expand its influence on several continents, this change is appropriate if not overdue. One of the Pentagon’s first steps in its rebalancing has been to direct a reduction in operations in Africa, which has triggered a predictable bureaucratic food fight over priorities. It remains to be seen whether this decrease will diminish the capabilities of poor but determined countries like Niger to strengthen their counterterrorism efforts.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that the terrorist threat is over and won’t come back. Although ISIS has been defeated in Iraq, many analysts believe the group still has plenty of fighters in the field who went to ground instead of trying to combat a vastly more powerful foe, and that the group will mount an offensive sometime soon. Terrorist groups thrive in conflict zones, and the continuing chaos in Yemen is a perfect setting for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to grow its forces. The challenge of dealing with foreign fighters returning from Iraq and Syria continues to occupy governments around the world. While the level of terrorist violence globally has been declining for the past couple of years, it is nonetheless at a historically high level and isn’t likely to fall off sharply anytime in the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd these are just the challenges of the moment. Jihadism will remain a potent force for years, and probably decades to come, for several reasons: With a few exceptions, especially among the oil monarchies, the Middle East and such Muslim majority countries as Pakistan remain in poor, sometimes disastrous shape. Economic stagnation is endemic, with job creation a shadow of what it should be. Most people in the region lack real political voice or representative institutions. In the West, especially in Europe, integration of Muslim minority communities is uneven at best, leaving many frustrated at their limited prospects. These big structural facts aren’t going to change quickly. The United States will need to continue investing in counterterrorism for a long time to come.\n\nAt the same time, it’s worth recognizing the America is well protected by excellent border controls, capable law enforcement and remarkable intelligence and military capabilities—as the targeting of Asiri underscores. With barely more than 100 people killed in the United States by jihadist operatives since 9/11, the record is a strong one that argues for taking this moment to revise our collective thinking about the terrorist threat. That is, the time has come to absorb the notion that jihadist terrorism is a fact of the contemporary world, that it can be managed but not eradicated and that we have developed excellent though not perfect tools for that task. That understanding, it seems to me, is the precondition for avoiding the kind of overreaction that helped lead us into Iraq and created near hysteria in 2014 when ISIS appeared on the scene.\n\nWill those realizations sink in? The president might be talking less about ISIS, but America continues to be in the grip of a Trump-accelerated xenophobia, as his continued emphasis on cutting off immigration and the rise in hate crimes since he launched his campaign has demonstrated. And it’s unlikely that our president is committed to the Pentagon’s new focus: Considering his campaign platform and his much-noted warmth toward Russia, one has to wonder whether Trump even read the cover memo on Mattis’ document reordering U.S. defense priorities when it crossed his desk for approval.\n\nIn light of over-the-top polarization, there is no reason to believe that our politicians won’t revert to the kind of outbidding on terrorism that had prodded the expansion of the counterterrorism machinery at the expense of so much else. And the nature of the media hasn’t changed: If anything, social media seems to be increasing the reverberation of news opinion that feeds outsize anxieties. A lot may depend on how much time there is until the next substantial attack, and, of course, what that event looks like. It’s not a test I’m looking forward to.\n\nAmbassador Daniel Benjamin is director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College and served as coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department 2009-2012.", "name": "17 Years After 9/11, Nobody Cares About Terrorism Anymore", "description": "Good.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/11/17-years-after-9-11-nobody-cares-about-terrorism-anymore-219746", "id": "db29ef50289304cebfc038ea9bb70bc397bc1c97", "keywords": ["cares", "terrorism", "counterterrorism", "isis", "process", "attacks", "late", "17", "threat", "anymore", "trump", "911", "russia", "terrorist"], "timestamp": "2018-09-11T00:00:00"}

There are currently 206 seats where Democrats have the advantage, compared to 205 for Republicans. But more of Democrats’ seats are safely in their column when compared to Republicans, and national trends suggest the wind is at Democrats’ back.\n\nFor POLITICO’s race ratings, each of the 435 House elections, 36 Senate contests — and 36 governor’s races, too — is rated on a 7-point scale: Solid Democratic, Likely Democratic, Lean Democratic, Toss-Up, Lean Republican, Likely Republican and Solid Republican.\n\nHouse\n\nThe election cycle began with Republicans holding key structural assets in the battle for House control. But over the course of the past year-and-a-half, those advantages have gradually eroded.\n\nRepublicans started with a number of entrenched incumbents in seats that swung against the GOP in last year’s presidential election. The problem? Many of them — like Ed Royce and Darrell Issa in Southern California, Rodney Frelinghuysen in New Jersey, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in South Florida and Dave Reichert in Washington state — chose to retire rather than run for reelection. Since incumbent members typically have more campaign cash in the bank and run stronger than candidates in open seats, it provided Democrats with a more even playing field than they might have otherwise had.\n\nAll told, more than 40 House Republicans aren’t seeking reelection, and Democrats already have the advantage in a number of these seats, including those currently held by Issa, Frelinghuysen, Ros-Lehtinen and Reichert.\n\nMany of the GOP incumbents who are running have their own problems. Fifty-six Republican incumbents were outraised by the Democratic challengers in the most recent fundraising quarter, and 16 of them trailed in cash on hand as of the end of June. One reason is that Democrats have been able to raise funds at a greater clip than past minority parties, in large part thanks to an unprecedented online fundraising network. Republicans are in better shape when it comes to outside money — Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading pro-GOP super PAC — had $73.3 million in cash on hand as of mid-July, its latest report with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nDemocrats also managed to chip away at another House GOP firewall: the maps under which the elections will be held. Nowhere is that more obvious than Pennsylvania: Republicans held a 13-to-5 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation at the beginning of 2017, but thanks to court-ordered redrawing of the districts, Democrats could capture a majority of the state’s House seats this November.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Trump — his average approval rating is down to 42 percent — and the GOP are near-toxic at a national level. Democrats’ lead on the generic ballot, on average, is in the high-single digits.\n\nAll the math — national and at the district level — boils down to this: Roughly half of the seats Democrats need to pick up are already leaning in their column.\n\nFour seats currently in GOP hands are even classified as Safe or Likely Democratic — New Jersey’s 2nd District and Pennsylvania’s 5th, 6th and 17th districts. In New Jersey, national Republicans have cut loose the party’s nominee, Seth Grossman, over bigoted statements Grossman has made in the past. Pennsylvania’s 5th and 6th districts are poised to move into the Democratic column as a result of new, favorable district lines. In Pennsylvania’s 17th District, Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb has a consistent lead over GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus in a member-vs.-member contest.\n\nDemocrats have another 10 Republican seats leaning in their direction — their candidates are currently favored, though not assured of victory. Four GOP incumbents are at least slight underdogs: Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia, Steve Knight in Southern California, Rod Blum in Eastern Iowa, Andy Barr in Kentucky. And Democrats are also favored to pick up seats where incumbents are retiring: Issa’s San Diego-area seat, Ros-Lehtinen’s Miami seat, Reichert’s Washington state seat, and a seat in southern North Carolina, where GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger lost his primary.\n\nOf the two-dozen seats rated as Toss-Ups, 23 are currently held by Republicans; just one, the southern Minnesota seat Rep. Tim Walz is vacating to run for governor, is held by a Democrat.\n\nSimilarly, of the 27 seats rated as Lean Republican, 26 are currently held by the GOP. Republicans’ best pick-up opportunity: the Minnesota Iron Range seat being vacated by retiring Rep. Rick Nolan.\n\nThere are some self-inflicted wounds for Republicans on the House map. Blum, whose seat is rated Lean Democratic, is facing an investigation by the House ethics committee. Virginia Rep. Scott Taylor’s campaign is under investigation for allegedly forging signatures on the qualification papers of an independent candidate that could siphon votes away from Elaine Luria, the Democratic nominee.\n\nTwo GOP incumbents are under federal indictments: New York Rep. Chris Collins and California Rep. Duncan Hunter. Republicans are trying to replace Collins — who said he doesn’t want to run again, even though he is the GOP nominee — on the ballot, but Democrats have promised to fight his removal. Hunter, meanwhile, is full-steam-ahead on his reelection bid in what would have otherwise been a safe GOP district.\n\nAll is not lost for Republicans: Some of their incumbents are in better-than-expected shape, given the Democratic lean of their districts. Reps. Carlos Curbelo (Florida), Will Hurd (Texas) and John Katko (New York) are favored to win reelection.\n\nDemocrats will make gains on Election Day, and a “wave election” is possible — though not yet guaranteed. An improvement in the national environment — combined with GOP outside groups’ hand-to-hand combat in some of these districts — can still result in Republicans’ saving their House majority.\n\nWith two months to go until Election Day, the House is rated as Lean Democratic.\n\nSenate\n\nRepublicans control 51 of the chamber’s 100 seats — or at least they will when former Sen. Jon Kyl takes the seat of late Arizona Sen. John McCain — and Democrats would need to net two seats in order to win back control. (Because Vice President Mike Pence breaks any ties in the chamber, a 50-50 Senate would still be controlled by Republicans.)\n\nThere are far more GOP opportunities on the board than chances for Democrats to pick up seats. Ten Democratic incumbents are seeking reelection in states Trump carried in 2016, while only Nevada Sen. Dean Heller is protecting a GOP-held seat in a Clinton state.\n\nOf the Democrats, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is the most vulnerable. Trump carried the state by 36 percentage points in 2016, and Republicans are confident Rep. Kevin Cramer will defeat her this fall. North Dakota is rated as Lean Republican.\n\nThe GOP also likes its chances to topple Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. Trump carried both states by just under 20 points. An NBC News/Marist poll out this week showed McCaskill deadlocked with her GOP challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley. Both races are rated as Toss Ups.\n\nThe Florida Senate race — which pits Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson against GOP Gov. Rick Scott — is also rated a Toss Up. As of early August, Scott had already spent $27.9 million on his campaign, and Democrats fear Nelson isn’t keeping pace. But Scott only won narrow victories in 2010 and 2014 — in great environments for Republicans — and the two candidates are still neck-and-neck, despite Scott’s early barrage.\n\nDemocrats are looking a little better in Montana and West Virginia — two other solid Trump states. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester is ahead of state Auditor Matt Rosendale, though Republicans hope Trump can help peel voters away from Tester.\n\nThat’s also true in West Virginia, where the president is expected to travel frequently before November. But Sen. Joe Manchin leads state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the latest polling. Both Montana and West Virginia are rated as Lean Democratic.\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s race against GOP state Sen. Leah Vukmir is rated as Lean Democratic, while three other Rust Belt Democrats are in the Likely Democratic column: Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Bob Casey (Pa.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio).\n\nAs for Democratic pick-up opportunities, two GOP-held seats are rated as Toss Ups: Arizona and Nevada. In Arizona — a state trending more Democratic over the past decade — the race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and GOP Rep. Martha McSally is likely to go down to the wire.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nevada, Heller has held his own with Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen thus far, polls show.\n\nTwo GOP-held seats are rated as Lean Republican: Tennessee, where popular former Gov. Phil Bredesen is running against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, and Texas, with Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s high-profile challenge of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBredesen is running roughly even with Blackburn in Tennessee, but Trump carried the state by 26 points in 2016. In Texas, Cruz is fully engaged and taking O’Rourke seriously.\n\nReclaiming the Senate requires Democrats to win all of the Toss Ups — and hold Heitkamp’s North Dakota seat. Or the party could lose North Dakota, but win all the Toss Ups and either Tennessee or Texas. Either way, it’s a tightrope walk at this point in the cycle. The Senate is rated as Likely Republican.\n\nGovernors\n\nDemocrats are likely to make gains in the number of governorships the party controls, a key pillar of the party’s plan to have more influence in policy-making — and the redrawing of political maps after the 2020 Census.\n\nTwo states that currently have GOP governors are now rated as Likely Democratic: Illinois and New Mexico. In Illinois, incumbent GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner is trailing Democrat J.B. Pritzker by a wide margin.\n\nThe race to replace Michigan GOP Gov. Rick Snyder is rated Lean Democratic: Gretchen Whitmer is a modest favorite over GOP state Attorney General Bill Schuette.\n\nOf the seven governors races in the Toss-Up column, all are in states currently helmed by Republicans: Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin. In Florida, a Quinnipiac University pol l out Tuesday gave Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the newly minted Democratic nominee, a slight advantage over Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn Wisconsin, two-term GOP Gov. Scott Walker is in the fight of his political life against state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers.\n\nRepublicans are looking a little stronger in five other races the party currently holds, which are rated as Lean Republican: Arizona, Kansas, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Vermont. The Alaska governor’s race is also rated as Lean Republican; the incumbent, Bill Walker, is an independent.\n\nThe GOP has a few pick-up opportunities from Democrats, though the Republican candidate is an underdog in all of them. Hawaii, Minnesota and Pennsylvania are rated Likely Democratic. Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon and Rhode Island are more winnable for Republicans, but each is rated Lean Democratic.\n\nTwo bright spots for Republicans: Massachusetts and Maryland. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker’s reelection effort is rated as Safe Republican, even in the bright-blue commonwealth. Meanwhile, the race in Maryland is rated Likely Republican, with Gov. Larry Hogan holding a big lead in the polls over Democratic nominee Ben Jealous.\n\nThe topline: Democrats are favored to pick up three governorships from Republicans, while the GOP could erase the only independent from the map. But the seven Toss-Up states are all held by Republicans, and a Democratic wave could flip those into the blue column.\n\n", "name": "POLITICO race ratings: 60 GOP House seats in danger", "description": "The Senate is a tightrope walk for Democrats.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/05/midterm-race-ratings-2018-806452", "id": "889c3fee558b09fb8aed27e70367ad317d7812a9", "keywords": ["politico", "ratings", "lean", "democratic", "60", "state", "seats", "republicans", "race", "democrats", "rep", "rated", "house", "danger", "gop"], "timestamp": "2018-09-05T00:00:00"}

The first 1,000 shoppers get a free reusable bag.\n\nIt remains to be seen if that event will generate the same kind of fervor H&M did. After all, Target is well known in Colorado, having operated stores here for decades. It’s got brand recognition but isn’t trendy or new like its Scandinavian counterpart.\n\nRegardless of how many people line up before the new store’s doors are flung open at 1600 California St., downtown business advocates are ecstatic over its arrival and what it says about the economic vitality of a portion of Denver sporting a retail vacancy rate of 3.3 percent.\n\n“When Target chooses to locate somewhere they are sending a message that the customer base is there,” Downtown Denver Partnership CEO Tami Door said Monday. “This shows this brand has identified the center city of Denver — and it sends this message to other brands — as a place where they believe they will be successful.”\n\nThe 16th Street Mall store won’t be just any Target. At 30,000 square feet, it’s less than quarter the size of the retailer’s average store. It will feature a curated collection of goods designed to appeal to downtown shoppers, Ashlee Justis, the store’s team lead, said.\n\nOn its main floor, the second floor of the 1600 California St. building, shoppers will find clothes and accessories — including Broncos and other local team gear — and an electronics and entertainment department complete with cellphones that can be activated on the spot. There will be a grocery section with fresh produce and frozen goods, as well as grab-and-go items such as sandwiches, meant to cater to customers popping in and out on their lunch breaks.\n\nFloor two will carry cosmetics and personal care products and travel goods — again catering to a specific downtown market segment: tourists. There will also be an assortment of home wares and decor, a category H&M added to its 16th Street Mall store in 2015.\n\n“Why this is going to be so exciting, especially for the downtown Denver guest, is this store is created especially for them,” Justis said. “It’s going to be a quick, convenient spot to get those products you have relied on Target for traditionally.”\n\nDoubling down on the convenience, the store will have a CVS pharmacy and self-checkout kiosks. It will also serve as the order pickup point for people who buy from Target.com, company officials say. Place an order on the website, and within an hour that item will be ready at the store.\n\nThe store is an example of Target’s real estate evolution. After going from big to jumbo in the form of its Super Target store formats, the company is now going small. When the 16th Street Mall store opens it will be one of 71 small format stores the retailer has opened across the country. Meant to fit in denser urban centers or near college campuses, the smaller footprint allows Target close places it hasn’t been before, such as downtown Denver, company spokeswoman Jacqueline DeBuse said.\n\n“We’ve always been interested in the (downtown) Denver community,” DeBuse said. “We know there are daytime professionals and round-the-clock residents.”\n\nDeBuse’s reference to round-the-clock residents offers a potential clue as to why it has taken Target so long to hit its mark downtown. The Downtown Denver Partnership’s CEO Door said her organization has been working on bringing the brand to the city’s urban core for decades. Every time an opportunity came up, some factor dragged it down, whether the location or property owner wasn’t the right fit, or Target not being in an expansion mode at the time, or the demographics not being strong enough.\n\n“When you’re working to attract a retail location, everything has to be right,” she said.\n\nIn downtown Denver today — defined by the partnership as the area made up of the Auraria, Lower Downtown, Ballpark, Central Platte Valley, Golden Triangle and Center Business District neighborhoods — more people are working, visiting and living than ever before. Randy Thelen, the partnership’s vice president of economic development, said 23,000 people live downtown, three times as many as 2000. The area’s 136,000 employees is an all-time high. Add that in with a $4 million tax incentive package from the Denver City Council, and the “Why now, Target?” question answers itself.", "name": "Coming Sunday: Target ready to open in downtown Denver’s 16th Street Mall", "description": "The 16th Street Mall store won't be just any Target.

This latest flight, Fear: Trump in the White House, finds President Donald Trump lurching and floundering in agony over the legal pains the Russia investigation have inflicted upon his administration, and it fully explains why Trump’s lawyers have avoided exposing him to the interrogatory requested by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nOn the afternoon of Jan. 27, 2018, Woodward writes, Trump and his attorney, John M. Dowd, met in the White House residence. Seated with the president “at a table with a view of the Washington and Jefferson Memorials,” Dowd proposed a practice run-through of the interview that Mueller had requested—and continues to request to this day.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“I would just like to give you sort of a feel of what testimony could be like,” Dowd said to Trump, a man who has submitted himself over his long and litigious life to dozens of depositions. One of the most memorable, and damning for Trump, is the one he gave during his 2006 libel suit against biographer Timothy O’Brien. As O’Brien wrote in Bloomberg in January, “Trump ultimately had to admit 30 times that he had lied over the years about all sorts of stuff: how much of a big Manhattan real estate project he owned; the price of one of his golf club memberships; the size of the Trump Organization; his wealth; his speaking fees; how many condos he had sold; his debts, and whether he borrowed money from his family to avoid going personally bankrupt. He also lied during the deposition about his business dealings with career criminals.”\n\nThe mock interview with Dowd showed that Trump had not done much since then to improve his testimony game. For one thing, Trump couldn’t remember anything. “I’m not sure,” Trump said to one question about Michael Flynn. “I don’t know,” he said to another. “I don’t know. I can’t remember,” he said to another question. To another query, “Trump said he couldn’t remember.” “You know, I don’t know,” he said to still another as if his memory banks had been degaussed.\n\nBut that wasn’t the worst of it. Actually, Trump could remember some things, and on those select things, he claimed perfect recall.\n\n“Why did you tell Director Comey that—you kind of asked him to take it easy on Flynn,” Dowd said to Trump.\n\n“I didn’t say that,” the president protested. “John, I absolutely didn’t say that.”\n\nWhen Dowd pressed him, Trump did what he does when not blinded by memory’s fog or all-seeing: He detonated into a Yosemite Sam-style rant, calling Comey a crook and a liar in his well-practiced critique. After a brief interval, Trump promptly returned to yowl-mode, rendering the next 30 minutes useless, housefly Woodward writes. “It was quite a sight seeing the president of the United States fuming like some aggrieved Shakespearean king,” Woodward continues. “Trump finally came down from the ceiling and began to regain composure,” and Dowd explained, tactfully, that his mercurial nature meant he couldn’t possibly testify.\n\n“I’ll be a real good witness,” Trump later told Dowd, but Dowd gave it to him unvarnished. “You are not a good witness.”\n\nWoodward’s account and the scathing op-ed by Anonymous published this week in the New York Times confirms everything we’ve learned about Trump’s relationship with the truth. In the president’s version, he’s never at fault; he’s the victim. He’s reckless and ill-informed, as Anonymous put it, a flip-flopper extraordinaire. “Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails,” Anonymous wrote, echoing Dowd’s mock-testimony session.\n\nTo be a good witness, you must remain consistent, but that skill is not in Trump’s tool bag. In fact, he has made an art of self-contradiction. This week, one of his first responses to the Anonymous piece was to call it phony. But inside the same tweet, he demanded that the New York Times surrender the author’s identity to him “for National Security purposes.” On Friday, he called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the identity of Anonymous, although no law had been broken, and for a lie-detector test to be administered to those suspected of writing the op-ed. He also claimed he was contemplating action against the New York Times, but didn’t say what sort of action. Trump also tweeted that “the Woodward book is a scam,” and that he doesn’t talk the way he was quoted. New York Times reporters Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman quickly proved his claim about the way he talks to be false, showing that he has used phrases like “dumb Southerner” and “retard” before.\n\nTrump’s current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, fully understands Trump’s unique relationship with the truth, which is why he keeps filibustering the question of a Mueller interview. One minute he tells the Associated Press the president wouldn’t answer Mueller’s obstruction of justice questions, the next moment he tells NBC News those questions are “not ruled in or out.” Because Mueller and his people don’t talk to the press, Giuliani is essentially playing tennis against the wall, hitting the ball ever harder and claiming every line call in his favor.\n\nAs Axios reported this week, Giuliani is essentially daring Mueller to subpoena the president, gambling that the special counsel doesn’t possess the moxie to fight the legal question of whether a president can be forced to give testimony. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that President Richard Nixon had to give up White House recordings and documents, but has never ruled on whether a president must testify. On Friday, the Giuliani hijinks continued, as he demanded to see a draft of Mueller’s report before it’s released so his team can rebut it contemporaneously. Some legal authorities interviewed by Business Insider essentially said, Nice try, Rudy, explaining that the report’s future is really up to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller. “Expect the Mueller report to be buttoned down and based on provable facts,” Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor told Business Insider. “Expect the White House response to be anything but that.”\n\nWoodward morphs from housefly to stinging horse-fly in the last paragraph of Fear as he offers Dowd’s final assessment of the president. “Trump had one overriding problem that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president: ‘You’re a fucking liar.’”\n\n******\n\n“The reason I talk to myself is because I’m the only one whose answers I accept,” George Carlin once said.

The number of people quitting jumped 3 percent to 3.58 million, also a record. Quits are typically a good sign that jobs are plentiful, because people usually quit when they have another job or are confident they can find one.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at 3.9 percent, near an 18-year low, businesses are increasingly desperate to find workers.

That figure represents the net total of jobs added, while the JOLTS data reports overall hires without subtracting quits, layoffs and resignations.\n\nThe jump in job openings in July suggests solid hiring will continue in the coming months.\n\nPrivate sector surveys also point to solid gains.

Or that Cory Booker’s “Spartacus” uprising amounted to a demand for documents that had already been authorized for release.\n\nOne thing Democrats are learning from President Donald Trump as the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh draw to a close: Floating an incendiary charge, with little to no factual basis, can draw the spotlight and force the opposition to prove a negative.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the run-up to 2020, it isn’t the details that resonate with base voters. It’s the show.\n\nDemocrats were never expected to derail Kavanaugh’s nomination in a Republican-held Congress. But his confirmation hearings served as a test for Harris and Booker ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign. And in a pre-primary measured in social media mentions and YouTube-ready moments, Harris and Booker this week came out ahead.\n\nTheir handling of the hearings wasn’t in the same category as some of Trump’s prevarications. But both Democrats showed, during their first high court hearings on the Judiciary Committee, that they too know how to elate their base and wound opponents without an airtight case.\n\nFrom the opening minute of the hearings, Harris muscled to the forefront, kicking off Democrats’ protest on Tuesday by charging that “we have not been given the opportunity to have a meaningful hearing.” She successfully challenged Kavanaugh on the deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as gay marriage, voting rights and abortion.\n\n“Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?” the former prosecutor asked at one point, causing Kavanaugh to stammer.\n\nThe next day, Harris featured the exchange in an email fundraising appeal, while running Kavanaugh-related ads on Facebook throughout the week.\n\n“If you’re with me in this fight, can you sign my petition opposing Judge Kavanagh’s nomination to the Supreme Court as Republicans rush through his confirmation hearings this week?” said one ad running Thursday.\n\nThe ad featured a photograph of Harris next to bold type reading, “Stop Brett Kavanaugh!”\n\nBut Harris puzzled observers when she pointedly asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe with anyone at a law firm that has long represented Trump. Kavanaugh was initially unable to answer the question, before definitively saying Thursday that he had not had such a discussion. Having never followed up on what she described as a “reliable” lead on the matter, Harris’ bid to undercut the nominee seemed to lack a firm foundation by the end of the committee’s marathon hearing.\n\nWhen it comes to exposure, however, the confrontation with Kavanaugh was a success. A C-SPAN video of the exchange posted on social media had nearly 6.5 million views as of Friday morning. The radio host Jerry Quickley played a clip of the exchange on the leftist KPFK radio station in Los Angeles, to which a caller glowed, “That senator was great!”\n\nFor Harris, the anti-Kavanaugh campaign had its intended effect. Her fans swooned.\n\n“Dear @senjudiciary, where do we send @KamalaHarris all the mics to drop?” the comedian Samantha Bee wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnd Harris’ doggedness, for many in her party, mattered more than her ultimate lack of evidence to back up her questioning.\n\nOne Democratic aide pointed to Kavanaugh’s own “evasive and tortured answer on the first day of hearings” as the reason that Harris and other Democrats kept digging in about the Trump-connected law firm.\n\n“If he had just given a straightforward answer to a simple question, he could have saved everyone a lot of time,” the aide said.\n\nHarris has spent more than a year raising her profile by confronting the president’s nominees, starting with her vote against the confirmation of John Kelly to head the Department of Homeland Security. She was one of only 11 senators to oppose Kelly’s confirmation, and she attracted another round of attention when Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told her at a confirmation hearing last year to be more “courteous” on the dais.\n\nWhile Harris and Booker appeared only to cheer their Democratic base, Republicans saw a longer-term opening for a future counter-attack. Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant who has long opposed Trump, criticized Democrats for adopting a tone that he said mirrored the president himself.\n\n“Listening to the junior Senator/Presidential candidate from CA,” Murphy said on Twitter. “The sneering tone of many of these questions from D’s on the Judiciary Committee is really offensive. Amazing how they can (correctly) condemn Trump for his tone yet act like this.”\n\nYet Harris’ Republican colleagues were relatively restrained in their response to her opaque inquiry. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) even rephrased her questions in an attempt to make it easier for Kavanaugh to answer — a seeming nod to their effectiveness.\n\nIf Booker had an opening to overshadow Harris, it appeared to come Thursday, when he vowed to release once-confidential records from Kavanaugh’s years in the George W. Bush White House. In what he likened to an “‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” Booker said he would risk expulsion from the Senate to release the documents himself.\n\nBut Republicans said the records had already been cleared for release, and the GOP spent days mocking the New Jersey senator.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) quipped after Booker let loose his confidential-documents gambit that “running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,” while Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) made a subtle joke Wednesday about Booker’s lengthy monologues.\n\nJudiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), known for his dry humor, asked Booker at one point “how long you’re going to say the same thing three or four times.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee distributed a memo criticizing Booker under the subject line, “Spartacus Of Newark’s Performance History,” and Sen. Marco Rubio, (R-Fla.) ridiculed Booker on Twitter.\n\n“On this day in 71B.C. the Thracian gladiator Spartacus was put to death by Marcus Licinius Crassus for disclosing confidential scrolls,” he wrote. “When informed days later that in fact the Roman Senate had already publicly released the scrolls, Crassus replied ‘Oh, ok, my bad.’”\n\nThe conservative opposition group America Rising kept a running tally of how many minutes of his own questioning time Booker used to speak, which dwarfed the number of minutes the nominee spent responding. Gayle Trotter, a spokeswoman for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, urged red-state Democrats to reject the “embarrassing performance” by their liberal colleagues on the panel, singling out Booker and Harris.\n\nBooker sought to wear the criticism as a badge of honor, telling CNN on Thursday night that Cornyn had leveled a “deep insult” by calling his conduct unbecoming for a senator. He said he persisted because “I was raised and taught that an unjust law, you almost have an obligation to stand against it.”\n\nHe also contended that he had first broken the rules as early as Wednesday night, when referencing then-confidential records while questioning Kavanaugh. And after the GOP revealed Booker’s initial document release had it in fact been confidential, he followed up by releasing more confidential records.\n\nWhile confusion over the documents’ release left Booker with a less-than-clean hit, Democrats outside the hearing room delighted at his tactics. The Women’s March, a group that galvanized progressive activists following Trump’s election, hailed Booker for “modeling exactly what we expect of every member of the Senate.” The Texas Democratic Party updated its announcement of Booker’s planned appearance at the party’s Johnson-Jordan dinner on Saturday to include praise for him “showing political courage by releasing confidential documents” in the hearings.\n\nHarris and Booker are among a growing number of Democrats who have pledged to no longer accept money from corporate political action committees, and the publicity from a week of nationally televised hearings could help them broaden their followings in the run-up to 2020. Harris has spent heavily to court small-dollar supporters online.\n\nYet in an era of short attention spans and non-stop news from Washington, it is unclear how enduring such a lift might prove.\n\nPaul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster, said, “We could have seven new stories that fly in the middle of everything, and Kavanaugh could be forgotten in 24 hours.”\n\n", "name": "Harris and Booker borrow Trump's tactics in Supreme Court fracas", "description": "Focus on publicity and don't sweat the facts.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/07/harris-booker-kavanaugh-supreme-court-810654", "id": "2fb8c9473ce260f966e73ea6a4118612688680a8", "keywords": ["court", "tactics", "trumps", "hearings", "supreme", "trump", "spent", "democrats", "kavanaugh", "borrow", "confirmation", "booker", "fracas", "harris", "release"], "timestamp": "2018-09-07T00:00:00"}

He timed the public signing ceremony to a global climate summit that will bring public officials from around the world to San Francisco this week.\n\nWith Sacramento and Washington engaged in a protracted policy standoff from the start of the Trump administration, much of the conflict has turned on California’s ability to maintain its aggressive environmental policies.\n\nAnd with both foreign dignitaries and U.S. officials with national aspirations preparing to gather in San Francisco for the climate summit, the divergence between those two power centers is on stark display: Even as the Trump administration has sought to unravel Barack Obama’s climate legacy, the nation’s largest state is forging ahead.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

He’s trying to subsidize coal, undermine vehicle emission standards, sabotage clean electricity, make it harder to buy electric vehicles and on and on. So, yes, we’re going on a certain course.”\n\n\n\n“Against the indifference of an entrenched global leadership, these delegates are demanding action now,” the governor tweeted shortly before he began speaking.\n\nTom Steyer, the wealthy environmental activist who has plunged millions into an effort aimed at impeaching Trump and into seeking to boost voter turnout and flip the House, was in attendance at a Monday press conference and praised Brown’s “world leadership” in making California a standard-bearer.\n\n“From a leadership standpoint and a symbolic standpoint, what he’s doing and what he’s helping this entire state do is to reframe the way the world thinks about what’s going on in terms of energy and climate — what’s possible and what’s necessary and what’s just,” Steyer said.\n\nIn recent years, Brown has helped shepherd through a suite of ambitious climate-change policies that include mandates to reduce carbon emissions and augment renewable energy use, and an extension of the state’s pioneering cap-and-trade program.\n\nBrown and other officials have lambasted the administration’s push to relax air quality rules and potentially dissolve California’s ability to set more stringent vehicle emission standards; California is leading a group of states seeking to challenge the administration and maintain the tougher rules.\n\nOver the weekend, Brown signed a pair of bills to block new oil and gas extraction in the waters off of California’s coast, a direct rejection of the Trump administration’s move to reverse Obama administration policies and throw open coastal waters to energy exploration.\n\n“Today, California’s message to the Trump administration is simple: Not here, not now,” Brown said in a pointed statement accompanying the weekend signing. “We will not let the federal government pillage public lands and destroy our treasured coast.”\n\nThe renewable energy law could also yield a political windfall for the bill’s author, former state senate leader Kevin de León, who will have another progressive accomplishment to trumpet as he seeks to unseat fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein by energizing California’s sizable liberal electorate.\n\n“Today California sends an unmistakable message to the nation and the world: regardless of who occupies the White House, California will always lead on climate change,” de León said.", "name": "California's Brown signs renewable energy bill in another rebuke to Trump", "description": "The law mandates that the state‘s retail electricity come from renewable sources by 2045.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/10/california-renewable-energy-trump-brown-813660", "id": "7b34cc2660084c732cc41130e61b687446548192", "keywords": ["change", "signs", "climate", "bill", "rebuke", "states", "trump", "world", "going", "brown", "californias", "california", "renewable", "energy"], "timestamp": "2018-09-10T00:00:00"}

It serves nearly all of Westminster north of West 92nd Avenue and south of 124th Avenue.\n\nAfter being briefed about the sewer’s capacity, age and condition issues last week, the City Council on Monday night unanimously adopted an emergency ordinance that freezes acceptance of new, large-scale development proposals in the area served by the Big Dry Creek network for up to a year.\n\n“The (sewer) system is now at a trigger point of risk that warrants both near-term mitigation measures, as well as longer-term expansion to support continued development,” a staff memo recommending the emergency ordinance read. “Not addressing these system constraints is believed to compromise the health, safety, and welfare of the community with a level of risk that is not acceptable.”\n\nThe moratorium, which went into effect at noon on Tuesday, is designed to allow a consultant to inspect the sewer, collecting information that will be put to use in a project to fix, expand and replace portions of it, according to a city memo. City staff are expected to work simultaneously to pinpoint spots for where incremental or innovative fixes could be employed and make plans for easements and land acquisitions that might be required by future repair and replace projects. One idea floated at Monday’s meeting was reactivating decommissioned sewer lines in the area to help with capacity.\n\nThe Big Dry Creek system was first assessed in 2012, then again in 2015, according to the city staff. Those studies found “several segments” of the system were nearing the end of their lifespan or were not large enough to handle all of development and growth in the city. The city made plans to overhaul the system starting in 2019 director of public works and utilities Max Kirschbaum said Monday.\n\nBut an assessment done earlier this year — when factoring in projects in the city’s pipeline and flows those could contribute to the sewer system — painted a dire picture. Kirschbaum said the system is already running the risk of a sanitary sewer overflow, an event where raw sewage escapes from a sanitary sewer.\n\nWestminster’s sewer flows have increased by 40 percent since 2008, city officials said. The Big Dry System was dates back to the 1970s, before the city went through several waves of population growth.\n\nThe moratorium applies to new development applications that would increase flows into the Big Dry Creek network. Home renovations or projects that will not add to the sewage flows will not be subject to the freeze, officials said.\n\nApplications and pre-applications submitted prior to the moratorium taking effect will be honored. But developers who fail to follow up a pre-application meeting with more complete planning documents within six months will see their projects expire, according to the city.\n\nEven if a developer has city approval to move forward with plans, they may not be given access to the sewer system. Westminster’s municipal code dictates wastewater service commitments do not take hold until a building permit is pulled. That means builders in the affected area who goes in for building permits may be told the sewer network does not have the capacity to serve their projects. Access to the sewer system will be assessed and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure fairness, city officials say.\n\nJenni Grafton, the city’s acting economic development director, estimated there are between 30 and 40 projects in the affected area that could be in line to pull permits. Some of the city’s premier mixed-used neighborhoods and shopping areas will not be impacted by the development freeze. The Downtown Westminster project, rising where the Westminster Mall once stood, and the Westminster Station transit-oriented development going up around the city’s B-Line train stop, are served by a separate sewer network. The same is true for its north Interstate 25 and Huron Street business district. Those areas include the St. Antony North Health Campus and the Orchard Town Center shopping area.\n\nSeveral developers that have projects on tap in Westminster came to Monday’s meeting to urge the council to move along their projects. Council members sought to assuage fears.\n\nCouncilwoman Shannon Bird said, “We are not closed for business.”\n\nThe city will lift the moratorium before 12 months if possible, but its sewer contractor is expected to need nine months to assess the system. Mayor Herb Atchison preached patience.\n\n“We need to get the study done first,” he said. “How big is (the problem) and how long do we think it will take us to fix it? That’s not going to happen in 12 months.”\n\nIt is unclear how much it might cost Westminster to address the emergency, but city staff did say where they expect much of the money to come from: sewer rate hikes and municipal debt.", "name": "Overburdened sewer system prompts Westminster City Council to ban new development for 12 months", "description": "A Westminster sewage collection network is so overtaxed and outdated, the City Council has enacted a year-long moratorium on new development that would feed into it.", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/?p=3143729", "id": "84f962a6a37935e7d0227b4a4a4c822004370be6", "keywords": ["westminster", "overburdened", "development", "dry", "city", "sewer", "network", "moratorium", "projects", "system", "ban", "council", "months", "big", "prompts"], "timestamp": "2018-07-24T02:06:38+00:00"}

Any franchise that spawned that much iconic imagery, along with almost a dozen sequels and remakes, has to be. But “Halloween” rises above mere fan-service nostalgia. By rectifying the victimhood narrative that followed Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) throughout the series, the movie remixes its slasher roots to become a thrilling feminist frolic.\n\nReturning to Haddonfield 40 years after Michael Myers stalked all those horny teenagers, director David Gordon Green’s rendition serves as something of a corrective, whether or not it was necessary. There’s a tongue-in-cheek wink to the whole thing, and the audience is in on the terrifying joke from beginning to end. All that obsessing over the boogeyman led us back to where we first started: Michael is who we’re here to see, but the story rightfully belongs to Laurie.\n\nSaturday’s midnight premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival got off to a rowdy start, the theater fizzing with excitement. Michael Myers himself ― or, a man dressed in a Michael Myers costume, if you won’t submit to such flights of fancy ― introduced the event by traipsing onto the darkened stage, an eerie red glow projecting his shadow onto the screen behind him. The crowd went wild, and didn’t let up for the 109-minute runtime.\n\nThat’s both the best and worst way to experience a movie. The energy becomes so palpable you can hardly stop to think about what’s actually unfolding ― and yet, for an over-the-top thriller lodged in Hollywood history, there’s nothing more fun. Accordingly, this is less a proper review and more an impetuous digest, which is only fitting for a film that never needed to be made but manages to justify its existence anyway.\n\nAll of this is to say: “Halloween” is thoroughly satisfying, even in its imperfections.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nGreen wisely scrubbed the series’ mythology, nixing the Michael-Laurie sibling twist that “Halloween 2” introduced. “That’s just what people made up to scare people,” a teenager says on Halloween morning, strolling down an aged street near the site of 1978′s so-called babysitter murders, now the stuff of Illinois legend. Michael is set to be transported from one asylum to another, where he will live out the rest of his days as “little more than pure evil.”\n\nBut the transfer doesn’t go so well. The bus carrying the inmates crashes, letting Michael wander back toward suburbia in search of a butcher knife and the woman who evaded his kill on that infamous night of terror. Long awaiting Michael’s return, Laurie has holed herself up in a secluded bungalow with a cabinet of guns and an underground bunker. She’s felt terrorized her entire life, raising her daughter (Judy Greer) with an iron-clad paranoia that splintered their relationship ― an incisive bit of trauma psychology that renders this “Halloween” Laurie’s stage through and through. “The new Loomis,” as she calls a psychiatrist (Haluk Bilginer) obsessed with discovering what lies beneath Michael’s hollow eyes and mute sluggishness, soon learns he won’t get very far in his research.\n\nOf course, the whole affair would be nothing if that knife didn’t get a workout. It’s in each stab that Green and his co-screenwriters, Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley, turn “Halloween” into a master class in self-aware callbacks. They’re embedded in the dialogue, the score and the aesthetics ― some humorous, some ghastly. That treatment can smother a movie that needs to function as more than a cheap commercial ploy, but because this update redrafts the overarching “Halloween” lore, it achieves a sweet spot between discovering something new and revisiting beloved familiar territory.\n\nOne allusion in particular, which I won’t spoil here, is so inspired that Saturday’s audience yelped in ecstasy, and I along with them. Other assorted callbacks are woven into the plot’s fiber: A night of trick-or-treating and babysitting unites the characters as Michael creeps his way down the Haddonfield streets, undiscerning in his victim selection. The movie’s MVP, other than Curtis and Greer, is a feisty young boy (Jibrail Nantambu) hyper-aware that he is in a horror flick. It’s there that McBride’s comedic hand looms largest; nothing in “Halloween” is as subversive as “Scream,” but that film’s influence on the genre continues to work wonders.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nGreen, a genre hopper who cut his teeth on quiet indies before helming “Pineapple Express” and “Stronger,” shows a deep love for Carpenter’s material, even if he doesn’t borrow the elder director’s knack for pacing. It’s the patient, menacing slow burn that makes “Halloween” a masterpiece, but Green is making a movie in 2018, when studios’ dominant filmmaking mode is rarely less than full-throttle velocity.\n\nFor Carpenter purists, that leaves something to be desired. There’s nothing as dynamic as the haunting perspective shots that first brought Michael Myers to life, but Green gives us plenty of grisly frights to cheer for in their absence. One or two might be a tad too grisly, forgetting that the things we don’t see often end up being the scariest. “Halloween” works hard to be a crowd pleaser, and while there’s nothing inherently wrong with that, it does wind up somewhat shortchanging the tone.\n\nBut by the electrifying final half hour, little of that matters. It all builds to Laurie’s moment in the sun ― or the moon, rather. Curtis, bringing a hard-edged bitterness to the character, knows just how much resolve to give the audience. We feel a catharsis on her behalf, further emboldened by how much she embraces the project’s knowingness.\n\n“Do as I say,” she tells her granddaughter (Andi Matichak), just as Laurie told young Tommy as he hid from the boogeyman in 1978. It’s a fitting summation of the whole affair: Do as she says, for she is the only one who knows this masked murderer’s ways, and the only one who can shepherd the ordeal to a gratifying conclusion. (This assumes there won’t be another sequel. One can never be too sure.)\n\nWhen Green and the cast took the stage as the lights rose at almost 2 a.m., there wasn’t a bleary eye in the house, even for those of us who’d been shlepping in and out of movie screenings for the past 18 hours.", "name": "The New 'Halloween' Is A Satisfying Showdown That Belongs To Jamie Lee Curtis", "description": "The direct sequel remixes its slasher roots to become a thrilling feminist frolic.
