Describing a “leadership style” that is “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective,” the official cited “early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment” that were dropped because “no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis.” Instead, he said, cooler heads are seeking “to steer the administration in the right direction until—one way or another—it’s over.”\n\nControversy has focused mostly on whether this official should be praised for curbing Trump or blasted for writing anonymously. But there’s another question that’s trickier: Can the 25th Amendment be used to send Trump back to Manhattan? Ratified in 1967, the amendment has four sections. Section 1 restated more or less what’s in the Constitution: that if the president is removed from office because of death or resignation, the vice president becomes president. Section 2 allows for the replacement of the vice president when the office is vacant; it was used to make Gerald Ford vice president after Spiro Agnew’s resignation in 1973, and to install Nelson Rockefeller after Ford’s ascension to the presidency. Section 3 sets forth when and how the president can voluntarily transfer his powers temporarily—as, for example, George W. Bush did twice when undergoing colonoscopies. But this debate centers on Section 4, which has never been invoked. This section lets the vice president and a majority of Cabinet secretaries (“or such body as Congress may by law provide”) declare the president “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” making the vice president the “Acting President” until the president, through a complex process, is deemed fit to return to office.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCan Trump be removed from office under this amendment? Or would doing so provoke a constitutional crisis, as the Times’ essayist feared? Some critics have attacked the official for not going forward with Section 4, suggesting that the internal undermining of Trump is dangerous or undemocratic. The history of the 25th Amendment, however, suggests that our unnamed informer is on solid ground.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe concern with presidential inability dates at least to the 1880s, when an assassin shot President James Garfield, who lay dying for 79 days. During that long stretch, Garfield was largely unable to carry out any presidential duties, but these were summer months, the presidency was a less substantial office, and, while some matters went neglected, no urgent need for his leadership arose. Still, Vice President Chester Arthur and others debated how to proceed, and Arthur did not want to look like a usurper. The original text of the Constitution says that in case of presidential inability, the powers and duties of the office devolve on the vice president—but it doesn’t say what constitutes inability or how it is determined. In his December 1881 message to Congress, Arthur, now president, noted many unresolved questions: “What is the intendment of the Constitution in its specification of ‘inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office’ as one of the contingencies which calls the Vice-President to the exercise of Presidential functions? Is the inability limited in its nature to long-continued intellectual incapacity, or has it a broader import? What must be its extent and duration? How must its existence be established?” He called on Congress to take up these and other related questions.\n\nBy the time of Woodrow Wilson’s presidency, however, the answers remained murky. And when Wilson suffered a major stroke in 1919, there was renewed discussion of legislation to clarify these questions. But the Republican-led Congress took no action to remove Wilson, even temporarily, fearing Democratic reprisals and voter backlash. Wilson himself showed no inclination to resign. In the event, his wife, Edith, nicknamed the “Presidentress,” and Wilson’s doctor and friend, Dr. Cary T. Grayson—neither of whom were elected officials—ended up making many decisions in his name.\n\nEfforts to resolve the issue took on new urgency in the nuclear age, when the danger of a mentally unfit or incapacitated president starting a war assumed apocalyptic dimensions. Dwight Eisenhower suffered several health crises, including a heart attack in 1955, a bout of crippling ileitis in 1956, and a stroke in 1957. His precarious health, and the ugly reputation of his vice president, Richard Nixon, prompted Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1956, to warn voters about putting Nixon one heartbeat away from nuclear control. In March 1958, after winning reelection, Eisenhower and Nixon signed an agreement providing that in the event of presidential inability, the president would inform the vice president (if possible) and the vice president would serve as acting president, exercising the powers and duties of the office. The president himself would decide when he was no longer inabled—notably, legislators used that word and not “disabled,” which can imply a surmountable handicap—and reassume the powers and duties of the office. John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson signed a similar agreement in 1961.\n\nKennedy’s assassination in 1963, along with the continuing specter of nuclear war, finally spurred the ratification of an amendment to resolve the confusion. Although Kennedy died quickly, people wondered what would have happened if he had lingered comatose in Parkland Hospital. “Has the Congress prepared the presidency adequately for the possibilities of a violent age?” New York Times columnist James Reston asked. “Is the rule of presidential succession satisfactory for these days of human madness and scientific destruction?”\n\n\n\n***\n\nSenator Birch Bayh of Indiana led the charge for a remedy. Drawing on the work of a young member of the American Bar Association, John D. Feerick, Bayh argued that Congress had to solve the questions around entitled inability—how it is defined, who initiates the question of whether it has occurred, who resolves the issue when it has been raised, and who decides if and when the inability has ended. Bayh drafted an amendment that made its way through Congress. Senate Minority Leader Everett M. Dirksen emerged as a key opponent; though he also favored an amendment, he wanted the broadest language possible that would empower Congress to determine presidential inability—a “blank check,” in Bayh’s view. In contrast, Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York wanted the amendment to define “inability” more closely, with more precision about the “gravity” and “duration” of the incapacity that would warrant action. Short of that, he wished for examples of what did not count as an inability.\n\nDuring hearings in 1964 and 1965, members of Congress debated what constituted “inability” in Sections 3 and 4. Some, such as Representative Richard Poff of Virginia, suggested that Section 4 should be used when the president was simply “unable or unwilling to make any rational decision.” But the burden of the congressional commentary was to conclude, as Feerick wrote, that “unpopularity, incompetence, impeachable conduct, poor judgment, and laziness [did] not constitute an ‘inability’ within the meanings of the amendment.”\n\nSo what did count? In a 1992 book, The President Has Been Shot, physician Herbert L. Abrams examined the situations in which the amendment’s framers intended for Sections 3 and 4 to be invoked. Section 3—the temporary transfer of power—applied, in his judgment, during “planned, major surgery,” other surgery requiring general anesthesia, and “the use of psychoactive drugs in significant amounts.” It could also be invoked, he said, in the event of “serious presidential illness”; “the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or of any other progressive, mentally disabling conditions”; if the president or his physician believed “that an illness, injury, or emotional condition is interfering with his judgment or ability to govern”; or during “any anticipated situations in which the president will be unable to communicate with his government,” such as a nuclear strike.\n\nAs for Section 4, Abrams said its use was more “complicated and delicate.” It applied during such serious situations as “loss of consciousness,” “significant alterations of the president’s cognitive faculties or inability to communicate,” “serious injury to the president following an accident or attack on his person,” “terminal illness,” and “progressive, mentally disabling conditions.”\n\nThe legislative debate over the amendment and the prevailing interpretations of its meanings suggest that, despite its vagueness, it doesn’t apply to someone like Trump. Trump has an extreme personality, with many negative qualities—as the Times' op-ed writer notes, he is “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.” Some might judge him to be a grandiose narcissist or even a pathological liar. But having a personality disorder or even certain forms of mental illness doesn’t necessarily render a president unfit to govern (Lincoln suffered from depression). And in fact, Trump is not “unable” to serve as president, as would be required to invoke the 25th Amendment. He is actually a high-achieving, high-functioning person who has excelled in business, entertainment and now politics. He hasn’t suffered from a crippling stroke, a psychotic break or dementia. He is, we would argue, temperamentally unsuited to be president—but that is a reason to vote against him, not to resort to a never-used clause in a constitutional amendment. If Cabinet officers tried to use Section 4, Trump would surely challenge them in court and in the court of public opinion—setting up a constitutional crisis that would make the Clinton impeachment and Bush v. Gore look like schoolyard spats. Trump might conceivably refuse to leave office even if ordered by the Supreme Court—at which point Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ loyalties would really be tested.\n\nSo what can be done to rein in Trump’s “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective” style? According to the Constitution, impeachment is supposed to be used only for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” Even if Trump has committed such crimes, convicting him would require the votes of 17 Republican senators—which aren’t likely to be forthcoming soon. For those who worry about Trump’s governance, the answer is to vote him out when he’s up for reelection, in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the best hope for the nation is for senior officials in the administration who are less impulsive and more reasonable than Trump to mitigate his worst inclinations—precisely what the anonymous White House official says some are attempting to do. Doing so is fully constitutional and far from unprecedented: Nixon’s aides often defied orders he made while drunk or in an emotional froth, and Reagan’s advisers famously sought to quietly set things right when his inattention or rhetorical recklessness caused trouble, as often happened. The Trump officials who are using their duly constituted power to try to avert disaster may or may not be “unsung heroes,” but surely it is better than the alternative—of trying to exploit a clause in the Constitution to cashier a president through nonelective means.\n\nDavid Greenberg, a professor of history and journalism and media studies at Rutgers, is a contributing editor at Politico Magazine.

Daniels' lawyer sees bid to shield Trump from a deposition.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's disgraced former personal lawyer Michael Cohen is trying to rescind the $130,000 hush money deal he struck with porn star Stormy Daniels to tamp down reports about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, but a lawyer for Daniels says the move seems to be aimed at preventing full disclosure about Trump's role in the agreement.\n\nCohen submitted a filing to a federal court in Los Angeles on Friday renouncing the contract and promising he will take no action to enforce it, although he said he might still try to recover the $130,000 Daniels received under the pact struck just days before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe move came less than three weeks after Cohen appeared before a federal judge in Manhattan and admitted his guilt on eight felony charges, including one that said the payment to Daniels violated federal campaign finance law because it was intended to aid Trump's presidential bid.\n\nCohen's latest action effectively concedes part of a lawsuit Daniels — whose real name is Stephanie Clifford — filed against Cohen and Trump in March seeking to void the contract. In a supplemental statement filed Saturday, lawyers for Trump said they would not seek to enforce any settlement and will accept Daniels’ claim that the contract was void or unenforceable. They also continued to insist that Trump was not himself party to it.\n\nHowever, Daniels' outspoken attorney Michael Avenatti said Friday that he views the legal tactic as a way of obscuring the truth.\n\n\"Michael Cohen is back to playing games and trying to protect Donald Trump. He is now pulling a legal stunt to try and 'fix it' so that we can’t depose Trump and present evidence to the American people about what happened,\" Avenatti wrote on Twitter. \"He is not a hero nor a patriot. He deserves what he gets.\n\n\"The “offer” is DOA. We have been anticipating this for months…..Let me be clear - my client and I will never settle the cases absent full disclosure and accountability.

It was also something of a dead letter, since Daniels appeared on \"60 Minutes\" in March and detailed the alleged sexual dalliance.\n\nThe move by Cohen's lawyers Friday does not appear to affect a part of the lawsuit accusing Cohen of defamation over a statement he made earlier this year allegedly suggesting Daniels was lying about her interactions with Trump.\n\nAttorneys for Cohen and Trump had moved to force the case into arbitration, but the judge froze all action in the case while the criminal investigation against Cohen unfolded.\n\nLast month, prior to Cohen's plea, the judge extended the stay through mid-September. A scheduling hearing on the suit is currently set for September 24.\n\nA lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a message Friday seeking comment on the latest developments.", "clickbait": null}

But people working on those matters said Thursday that the Times piece only amps up the president’s paranoia by handing him proof that members of his own team are working against him, according to interviews with more than a dozen Republicans, including nine senators.\n\n“It kind of reinforces his message out there that there’s a bunch of folks here embedded in the Washington bureaucracy that are out to get him. I’m not sure it accomplishes what the folks behind it think it does,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of GOP leadership.\n\nNow the president is likely to view any disagreement from advisers with suspicion.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n“What this person did is badly hurt the effort to rein in Trump ... and it will make him crazy,” said a Republican close to the White House. “Now, if you say to the president, ‘I see where you’re heading, but I’m not sure about that’ — he’s going to think, ‘Ah, you wrote that.’”\n\nEven some of Trump’s most public critics said they didn’t understand the value of the op-ed, other than to state publicly what’s been discussed privately among Washington Republicans since Trump was elected nearly two years ago.\n\n“I’m not a fan of people doing things in an anonymous way. If you’ve got something to say, look the camera in the eye and say it. Talk to people directly. When I read it, to me there was nothing new,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a frequent Trump critic. “Any of us who have dealt with the White House understand the situation that’s there.”\n\n“There are lots of really, really good people around the president who are trying to restrain his impulsiveness,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told talk radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday morning. “I don’t understand the morality of why anyone would write the piece, because it seems pretty obvious to me that what it’s going to do is foster more paranoia.”\n\nA handful of Republicans including Corker, Sasse and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) often air their complaints about Trump publicly. But the vast majority of GOP lawmakers carp about the president’s erratic behavior in private, while quietly working on legislation that in some cases contradicts the president’s positions.\n\nThe anonymous op-ed argued that the president resisted diplomatic efforts to push back on Russian aggression — including a move to expel Russian spies in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Great Britain — before giving in to senior advisers. GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill have done much the same, helping to force the imposition of additional sanctions on Russia in July of last year over White House objections, but without labeling themselves part of the resistance.\n\nFlake said he’s much more impressed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions fortitude in refusing to quit in the face of constant barbs and insults from Trump than he was by an administration aide calling out Trump under the cloak of anonymity.\n\n“What’s more remarkable is what’s going on out in the open: Jeff Sessions. You have the president instructing him to reward his friends and punish his enemies and Jeff is saying no,” the retiring Arizona senator said. “That’s the preferred model. And I hope he keeps it up.”\n\nBut such episodes have been rare since the presidential campaign, when dozens of Republican foreign policy experts signed letters declaring their opposition to Trump on the grounds that he was, in their view, unfit for office.\n\n“Most fundamentally, Mr. Trump lacks the character, values, experience to be president,” one of the letters stated. Many Republicans didn’t sign the letters: domestic policy wonks and elected officials were not invited to do so. But it nonetheless captured the consensus view of most Republicans both during the campaign and since Trump entered the White House.\n\nWhile the letter signers outed themselves publicly and were blacklisted by the new administration, hundreds of policy experts who shared their views but did not publicly denounce the president during the campaign joined the new administration. The result, to a larger extent than ever before, is a government filled with hundreds of political appointees — tapped for their ostensible loyalty to the administration — who nonetheless have a dim view of the president.\n\nThough they disagree with the publication of an op-ed laying out the quiet resistance to Trump, many Republicans have tried their own tactics at moderating the president. Top party leaders have tried, repeatedly, to tell the president to stop making off-the-cuff remarks and tweets. Among his latest missives, Trump raised the prospect of “treason” and demanded that the Times turn over the name of the anonymous official in the name of national security.\n\n“A number of us have given the president some friendly advice, like on the Twitter account and the like. But he’s convinced that helped him get elected president,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). “We’ve tried to give him advice in that area. And he rejected it.”\n\nCornyn was with Trump and other top leaders when the Times op-ed came out. At the time, the president was discussing revelations in Bob Woodward’s new book and praising his staff for publicly refuting them.\n\nWith Trump already feeling embattled by Woodward’s book, Republicans’ patience for anonymous dishing about the White House is growing thinner. This is not the time for more drama, they say: The party’s congressional majorities in Congress on the line, and a government shutdown deadline is weeks away.\n\nSeveral senators said in interviews that the op-ed author should resign and go public if he or she wants to make a point.\n\n“You work at his pleasure [of the president]. If the moment comes when you know longer work for him, you should leave. And if you feel that you saw things you didn’t like and the public deserves to know, you should say it publicly and you should say it in your name,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). “It’s not a good precedent to set for our republic.”\n\nIf the op-ed writer intended on drawing out more public critics in the administration or Congress, there was no evidence on Thursday that it had worked. And now, some of Trump’s closest allies say the party is determined now more than ever to rally around him.\n\n“I think it’s actually helping the president, I really do, to have something like that happen,” said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). “There’s a turncoat in there. I just think that has the opposite effect than intended.”", "clickbait": null}

At the root of this fear and loathing is mutual incomprehension: Liberals simply don’t understand conservatives, and vice versa. In years past, the historical profession has done little to improve matters. Liberal historians typically treated conservatives and their ideas with disdain, when they deigned to notice them at all.\n\nThe end-of-century victories of Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich, however, forced historians to realize that conservatism could no longer be dismissed as a mere road bump on the inexorable progression toward a liberal future. The result, over the past two decades, has been a veritable tsunami of historical literature on conservatism. Virtually all of these works have been written by liberals. Nonetheless, historians of this new generation consider themselves to be unbiased and even sympathetic observers of conservatism. Many believe their collective efforts have produced a profound historical understanding of conservatism as an intellectual and cultural phenomenon, and thus contributed in some measure to bringing politically opposed citizens together.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nColor me skeptical. I was a graduate student at the beginning of this new wave of conservative studies and I couldn’t help but notice that it coincided with the historical profession’s purge of any scholars who could be described as Republicans or conservatives. Some of the new works on conservatism have been excellent, others awful. But nearly all reveal the pitfalls for liberals writing about a movement with which they have no personal experience. If you’re a historian who has not a single conservative colleague—and perhaps not even one conservative friend—chances are you’ll approach conservatism as anthropologists once approached tribes they considered remote, exotic, and quite possibly dangerous.\n\nThe result is that two decades’ worth of scholarship hasn’t contributed as much as one might have hoped to our understanding of conservatism, especially in the age of Trump. This is particularly true of the works that have been most popular with the broader public. That’s a shame, because historians could provide deeper answers than they have so far to the questions many citizens now wrestle with: How did our political system become so divided and dysfunctional? To what extent is the conservative movement responsible for Trump’s rise? What have been the movement’s greatest successes as well as failures, and what relevance do they have to our understanding of ourselves as a nation and a people?\n\nThose answers aren’t just relevant to our understanding of the past. A more robust, even-tempered account of conservatism is key to understanding what role the political and cultural phenomenon will play in our country’s future—whether liberals want to believe it or not.\n\n\n\n***\n\nA common flaw of the new political histories is to take the extreme right as representative of conservatism (or the Republican Party) as a whole. Lisa McGirr’s 2001 Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right was one of the earliest and best of these histories, but many of its readers came away convinced that the rabidly anti-communist John Birch Society dominated the Republican Party in the early 1960s, when it was a marginal element at best.\n\nThere’s little in McGirr’s scrupulously nonjudgmental account of the Birchers that alludes to their wild, conspiratorial fantasies, like the notion that the United Nations was training an army of barefoot African cannibals in Georgia to take over the United States, or that a “1313” committee of University of Chicago eggheads was plotting to deprive Americans of their rights to vote and hold property. Bircher-type thinking has had a resurgence on the present-day political right and points toward the enduring appeal of conspiratorial thinking in American life, so the organization merits study. But scholars should keep in mind that National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr., as part of his larger “fusionist” project that eventually led to Reagan’s election, branded the Birchers as “kooks” and was able (for a while) to keep them out of the conservative mainstream.\n\nThe success of Buckley and his “movement” conservatives at transforming the GOP into an ideological vessel has led scholars to overlook the internal party warfare between moderates and conservatives that raged throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and continues in a diminished form today. Some scholars also downplay the real differences that separate traditionalists, libertarians, paleo-conservatives and neo-conservatives, among any other number of ideological splinter groups. Like many liberal voters, they assume that the Tuesday Group faction in the House of Representatives is just like the Freedom Caucus, or that Speaker Paul Ryan’s beliefs are more or less interchangeable with those of President Donald Trump or Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\nIn fact, one of the more influential studies of conservatism, Corey Robin’s The Reactionary Mind, insists that such seemingly disparate figures as Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, Milton Friedman and Sarah Palin are all more or less the same, sharing the overarching goal of preserving the ruling order’s power and privilege against liberationist movements from below. In his view, the ideals conservatives tout (greater freedom, robust public morality, economic growth and deference to the Constitution) are nothing but fig-leaf cover for oppression, and anyone outside the elite who thinks otherwise is a victim of false consciousness. Robin—who, full disclosure, helped make my Ph.D. years miserable by leading a grad student unionization effort at my university—advances his argument with considerable force and erudition. But his reductionist thesis is the mirror image of the sloppy right-wing canard that liberalism is no different from socialism, or even communism.\n\nSome scholars bring their present-day political concerns to bear on the past, particularly in relation to the Republican Party’s approach to racial matters, assuming that it’s inherently a party of racial oppression . In this view, African-American demands for racial equality have always entailed a program of economic redistribution—and because such programs are anathema to both moderate and conservative Republicans, then by definition Republicans cannot support civil rights. Of course, this presentist position is at odds with the historical reality, which is that civil rights activists of the 1960s viewed the considerable majority of congressional Republicans as allies, and acknowledged that the movement’s great advances could not have been achieved without their help.\n\nHeather Cox Richardson’s To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party actually posits that the current GOP upholds the racist and elitist principles of the pre-Civil War slaveholding class. Richardson’s account is a mélange of liberal errors regarding conservative history. Like Robin, she dismisses Reagan’s populism as a screen for rapacious business interests. She contends that racism was the essence of Buckley’s New Right, and further that the Birch Society spread his ideas to ordinary voters. Buckley’s endorsement of Southern segregation was a moral blot on the conservative movement, and he later acknowledged it as his gravest error. But it’s anti-historical to assume that Buckley was little more than a Klansman with a large vocabulary, or to dismiss the monumental divisions on the right as minor quarrels within a united white supremacist alliance.\n\nSome of the most highly praised scholars of conservatism in recent years have openly acknowledged their political opposition to the movement. Rick Perlstein, whom New York Times columnist Paul Krugman recently pronounced “our leading historian of modern conservatism,” wrote a column a few years ago declaring “There Are No More Honest Conservatives, So Stop Looking for One.” Perlstein made a big splash in 2001 with Before the Storm, a well-researched account of Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign that even conservatives praised for its empathy and insight. But Perlstein’s subsequent works, Nixonland and The Invisible Bridge, portray conservatives like Richard Nixon and Reagan as cartoon villains, all but ignoring the progressive parts of Nixon’s record and the pragmatic dimension of Reagan’s.\n\nPerlstein’s treatment of conservatism is positively Solomonic, however, in comparison with Duke University professor Nancy MacLean’s Democracy in Chains, a 2017 National Book Award finalist that focuses on Nobel Prize-winning libertarian economist James Buchanan. In MacLean’s telling, Buchanan’s “public-choice” school of economics provided the intellectual blueprint used by billionaire Charles Koch to advance a “diabolical” and “wicked” plan to suppress democracy by handcuffing government—a crime to which the entire Republican Party is now, apparently, a willing accessory. As numerous critics from across the political spectrum have pointed out, MacLean’s conspiracy theory owes more to her strained interpretations than actual evidence, and her account is replete with errors and distortions.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIt’s true that the era when historians ignored conservatism or dismissed it as a curio is over; many universities now offer entire courses on its history. But a closer look at their syllabi typically reveals a paucity of writings by actual conservatives and a glut of hostile interpretations by writers such as Robin, Cox Richardson, Perlstein and MacLean. One teacher of such a course, Seth Cotlar of Willamette University, who was recently the subject of an admiring piece in Vox, apparently believes that the two major conservative intellectuals of the 1990s were Gingrich and Dinesh D’Souza—an error that no one who was personally involved with the conservative movement would ever make.\n\nGingrich was interested in ideas—particularly those of futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler—but he was primarily a political missile aimed at ending four decades of Democratic rule, a goal he would achieve by means both fair and foul. And from what I remember of the culture wars of that era, most conservatives I knew viewed D’Souza as a slippery but useful opportunist. His 1991 book Illiberal Education received wide attention because many people, not just conservatives, were worried about the universities’ drift toward political correctness. Even at the time, however, the leading critiques of higher education came from writers like Jacques Barzun, John Searle, Diane Ravitch, E. D. Hirsch, Alvin Kernan, Frank Kermode, Roger Kimball, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Charlie Sykes, William Bennett, and especially Allan Bloom.\n\nD’Souza’s demagogic instincts were held in check by his desire to appear in such company, and to satisfy gatekeepers like Buckley who wanted the movement to be respectable (and intellectually defensible). The Fox News Channel’s debut in 1996 did much to break down those restraints, with extremism and charlatanry becoming more promising career paths for would-be conservative talking heads.\n\nStill, the serious work of intellectual conservatism at that time came from thinkers who had little to do with the emerging political-media entertainment complex on the right—people like Christopher Lasch, Roger Scruton, Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom, Eugene Genovese, Charles Murray, Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele and Robert Hughes, to name a few. The ‘90s also brought in new voices on the neoconservative/neoliberal front like David Frum, Michael Lind, Andrew Sullivan, Francis Fukuyama, John McWhorter, Richard Brookhiser, Mickey Kaus, Michael Kelly, William Kristol and John Podhoretz.\n\nOf course, not all the works of that period’s conservative tribunes have aged well. Culture wars tend to produce more heat than light. Bloom’s musings on rock and roll seem as ridiculous now as they did then, and few conservative intellectuals still defend Charles Murray’s 1994 The Bell Curve, with its faulty conclusions on race and intelligence—though even fewer support the campus left’s attempts to prevent him from speaking on any other subject. The escalating polarization of the Gingrich era often overwhelmed any attempt at evenhanded analysis, and it’s hard to read the neoconservatives of the 1990s now without thinking of the Iraq War disaster looming on the horizon.\n\nBut the conservatives listed above were for the most part intellectually honest, dedicated to the effort of persuading the unconvinced, and capable of changing their minds in the face of conflicting evidence. Liberals who see the conservative movement as an unchanging monolith of oppression have a hard time understanding why many of the conservative thinkers of the 1990s now oppose Trump and believe the movement has become a shambles.\n\nLiberalism and conservatism have conditioned each other throughout their collisions over the course of American history, the ever-evolving yin and yang of our collective political consciousness. While the present moment may be an exception, American liberals and conservatives have almost always shared the same goals of peace and prosperity, although the means proposed for reaching those goals have usually been very different.\n\nOur current moment of crisis has further strained historians’ attempts to arrive at an impartial, penetrating understanding of American conservatism. Indeed, a growing school of academic thought believes that such a “disinterested” understanding may not be possible, or even desirable. It’s unlikely that a more nuanced history of conservatism will emerge until this latest culture war has run its course.\n\nIn the meantime, liberal historians should consider subscribing to the Claremont Review of Books or National Affairs, while conservatives should pick up some copies of the Nation or New Yorker. At least your anger will be better informed.\n\nGeoffrey Kabaservice is director of political studies at the Niskanen Center and the author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party.\n\nThis article tagged under: History\n\nConservatism\n\nPolitical Thought", "clickbait": null}

It serves nearly all of Westminster north of West 92nd Avenue and south of 124th Avenue.\n\nAfter being briefed about the sewer’s capacity, age and condition issues last week, the City Council on Monday night unanimously adopted an emergency ordinance that freezes acceptance of new, large-scale development proposals in the area served by the Big Dry Creek network for up to a year.\n\n“The (sewer) system is now at a trigger point of risk that warrants both near-term mitigation measures, as well as longer-term expansion to support continued development,” a staff memo recommending the emergency ordinance read. “Not addressing these system constraints is believed to compromise the health, safety, and welfare of the community with a level of risk that is not acceptable.”\n\nThe moratorium, which went into effect at noon on Tuesday, is designed to allow a consultant to inspect the sewer, collecting information that will be put to use in a project to fix, expand and replace portions of it, according to a city memo. City staff are expected to work simultaneously to pinpoint spots for where incremental or innovative fixes could be employed and make plans for easements and land acquisitions that might be required by future repair and replace projects. One idea floated at Monday’s meeting was reactivating decommissioned sewer lines in the area to help with capacity.\n\nThe Big Dry Creek system was first assessed in 2012, then again in 2015, according to the city staff. Those studies found “several segments” of the system were nearing the end of their lifespan or were not large enough to handle all of development and growth in the city. The city made plans to overhaul the system starting in 2019 director of public works and utilities Max Kirschbaum said Monday.\n\nBut an assessment done earlier this year — when factoring in projects in the city’s pipeline and flows those could contribute to the sewer system — painted a dire picture. Kirschbaum said the system is already running the risk of a sanitary sewer overflow, an event where raw sewage escapes from a sanitary sewer.\n\nWestminster’s sewer flows have increased by 40 percent since 2008, city officials said. The Big Dry System was dates back to the 1970s, before the city went through several waves of population growth.\n\nThe moratorium applies to new development applications that would increase flows into the Big Dry Creek network. Home renovations or projects that will not add to the sewage flows will not be subject to the freeze, officials said.\n\nApplications and pre-applications submitted prior to the moratorium taking effect will be honored. But developers who fail to follow up a pre-application meeting with more complete planning documents within six months will see their projects expire, according to the city.\n\nEven if a developer has city approval to move forward with plans, they may not be given access to the sewer system. Westminster’s municipal code dictates wastewater service commitments do not take hold until a building permit is pulled. That means builders in the affected area who goes in for building permits may be told the sewer network does not have the capacity to serve their projects. Access to the sewer system will be assessed and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure fairness, city officials say.\n\nJenni Grafton, the city’s acting economic development director, estimated there are between 30 and 40 projects in the affected area that could be in line to pull permits. Some of the city’s premier mixed-used neighborhoods and shopping areas will not be impacted by the development freeze. The Downtown Westminster project, rising where the Westminster Mall once stood, and the Westminster Station transit-oriented development going up around the city’s B-Line train stop, are served by a separate sewer network. The same is true for its north Interstate 25 and Huron Street business district. Those areas include the St. Antony North Health Campus and the Orchard Town Center shopping area.\n\nSeveral developers that have projects on tap in Westminster came to Monday’s meeting to urge the council to move along their projects. Council members sought to assuage fears.\n\nCouncilwoman Shannon Bird said, “We are not closed for business.”\n\nThe city will lift the moratorium before 12 months if possible, but its sewer contractor is expected to need nine months to assess the system.

There was only one space available, and it was marked “Authorized Vehicles Only.” Anxious — you don’t want to have to bail your rental out of a tow pound in Belzoni, Miss. — I looked around and spotted the sheriff escorting a handcuffed prisoner in an orange jumpsuit through the parking lot.

It's the first update to the rankings since POLITICO reported that they create incentives for schools to favor wealthier students over less wealthy applicants. The rankings are so closely followed in the academic world that some colleges have built them into strategic plans.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStill, the top of the U.S. News rankings doesn't look that much different than in years past. The top spots among national universities are still dominated by the Ivy League and other elite private schools. Princeton and Harvard were No. 1 and No. 2. Third place was split among Columbia, MIT, University of Chicago and Yale.\n\nThe formula now includes indicators meant to measure \"social mobility\" and drops an acceptance rate measure that benefited schools that turned the most students away. U.S. News says the changes are based on discussions with college leaders during the last year and the new social mobility indicator is based on newly available federal data.\n\nAmong the colleges that benefited most from the changes was the entire California university system — \"partly due to the universities’ performance graduating high proportions of low-income students,\" said Robert Morse, chief data strategist at U.S. News & World Report.\n\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Over time, our ranking model has put more emphasis on outcomes measures ... As part of this evolving process, we’ve wanted to measure whether schools were successful at serving all of their students, regardless of economic status.\"\n\nThe new social mobility indicators account for 5 percent of the ranking formula. One of them simply weighs the graduation rates of students who receive federal Pell Grants, which go to lower-income students.\n\nThe other indicator takes it a step further and measures the differences in graduation rates of Pell Grant students and students who don't receive Pell Grants at the same school, which Morse said \"evaluates a school’s success at achieving equity between low-income students and their peers.\"\n\nScores are adjusted so schools that enroll the highest percentage of low-income students get the most credit for these graduation rates, Morse said.\n\nThe formula previously only accounted for economic diversity through a measure it calls \"graduation rate performance,\" which controls for factors like test scores and income and predicts what a school’s graduation rate should be. If the actual rate is higher, U.S. News deemed the college was “enhancing achievement, or over-performing,” and it would get a boost.\n\nThat factor remains and when combined with the new social mobility indicators, Morse says 13 percent of a school's rank is now dependent on the economic diversity of its campus.\n\nU.S. News is also no longer factoring in a school's acceptance rate. It used to give a boost to schools with lower rates — a measure many colleges sought to achieve by leaning more on early decision admissions, which hurt lower-income students who apply to more schools in order to compare financial aid packages.\n\nThe publication is also giving less weight to a student selectivity measure that relies heavily on students' scores on tests like the SAT and ACT — which have been shown to correlate with wealth. The measure is now only 10 percent of the formula, down from 12.5 percent.", "clickbait": null}

Forget about a potential showdown to lead the House Republican Conference: The only thing the No. 2 and 3 House Republicans care about is saving their majority, they insist.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the rivalry between the two men is as intense as ever, as the moment of reckoning to determine who will replace Paul Ryan draws closer — and the prospect of losing the House in the midterms grows.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nScalise has been busy raising his national profile in ways that some McCarthy allies feel threatens the California Republican’s bid to lead the conference. In recent months, Scalise, the majority whip, has staked out several hard-line positions favored by conservatives. His moves have put McCarthy in the awkward position of having to follow Scalise or anger the far-right, whose support McCarthy needs to become speaker.\n\nLike McCarthy, Scalise has been barnstorming the country raising money for lawmakers, chits that could be quite valuable if there is an opening to lead the conference. His office frequently touts his fundraising, noting that his totals have eclipsed any previous GOP whip. Scalise’s team doesn’t spell out that McCarthy previously held the job, but the message is clear whom they’re comparing him to.\n\nScalise, who has backed McCarthy for speaker this spring but is considering a bid if McCarthy falls short, recently hired a former political operative for ex-Speaker John Boehner to coordinate his campaign efforts. The Louisiana Republican will name Grant Saunders, Boehner's former deputy executive director, as his political director this week.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMembers and top aides are also privately speculating about whether Scalise would challenge McCarthy for minority leader. Republicans are increasingly concerned that they will lose the majority, though Scalise in an interview last week said he remains confident that won't happen.\n\nAnd with Freedom Caucus leader Jim Jordan expected to run for the top leadership post, some House Republicans have wondered whether Scalise would run as a compromise option for Republicans wary of McCarthy or suspicious of Jordan.\n\nFor now, neither camp will discuss it. During a tri-city sweep in upstate New York last week, Scalise demurred on all questions leadership-related.\n\n“Kevin and I are both friends,” Scalise told a cluster of reporters outside a fundraiser for Rep. Tom Reed fundraiser just south of the Finger Lakes. “And I think Kevin would tell you the same thing that I’m about to tell you: We are very focused right now on making sure that we do our job. Because if we worry about what our titles will be, a few months from now, Nancy Pelosi will be speaker by the time the counting is done.”\n\nAt a backyard barbecue in Syracuse, while more than 150 New York Republicans filled their plates with hotdogs and sautéed mushrooms, Scalise touted vulnerable Rep. John Katko’s work on bipartisan issues he said don’t get much attention in the press. Katko, he said, has “set a record for the most bills passed in a two-year period” — but Pelosi, he warned the crowd, “has targeted this district.”\n\n“You know what is at stake this election,” Scalise said, standing on a deck overlooking donors gathered around a posh pool surrounded by flower beds. “We want to keep passing good bills and solving real problems, and this one guy has over 30 pieces of legislation signed into law. So it’s important that he come back!”\n\nLawmakers remember these sorts of favors. The ability to raise money and gin up the base undeniably factor into the conference's choice of leaders.\n\nIt’s one reason Scalise, who spoke without prepared remarks at three stops that day, and McCarthy have spent all of August on the trail. Of course, they want to keep the majority, but they also are seeking to build alliances ahead of the leadership struggle later this year.\n\nMany House Republicans say McCarthy is still favored to lead the conference. He's next in line and remains the biggest fundraiser after Ryan. In August, he visited 20 cities on behalf of 35 incumbents, raking in more than $4 million. His office said he has raised just over $41 million as of mid-July, and as a \"special guest\" at several events, helped haul in an additional $20 million for 128 members and six candidates.\n\nMuch of that was done with the help of Vice President Mike Pence, who’s been raising money alongside the majority leader. Their joint fundraising committee has been seen by House Republicans as a sort of pass-the-baton arrangement for McCarthy, signifying that he’s next in line to take over for Ryan.\n\nStill, Pence appears to have hedged his bets where leadership is concerned. He not only advised Trump to stay out the leadership struggle that’s expected to ensue after Election Day; Pence also agreed to hold a fundraiser with Scalise and open it up to the press in early August.\n\nThe event, which Scalise’s office said raised $1.4 million, drew notice from political observers who once again saw a whip working to raise his profile.\n\nScalise’s fundraising numbers are smaller, to be sure — though he doesn’t have Pence, a major draw for the party, with him on the trail. Scalise raised just over $12 million to date this cycle, roughly doubling what any previous whip raised at this point in the campaign season, his office notes. He's also been working to build out a digital fundraising platform, raising about $2 million over the past nine months from 40,000 mostly small donors.\n\nThat doesn’t include money Scalise helped raise for members. That was main focus here last week when he chartered a plane to hopscotch events for Katko, Reed and Elise Stefanik — all Democratic targets.\n\nBack in Washington, everything Scalise and McCarthy do is being viewed through the lens of the looming leadership void. Scalise raised eyebrows when he appeared to back the conservative push to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in July — something Ryan and most of GOP leadership have firmly opposed.\n\nThe move jammed McCarthy, cornering him between Ryan, who has endorsed him as his successor, and Freedom Caucus leaders pushing impeachment. Exacerbating his dilemma was McCarthy’s close friend President Donald Trump, who has egged on conservatives in their crusade against Rosenstein.\n\n“They need to comply with subpoenas in Congress, which is a basic constitutional duty that we have,” Scalise said of the Justice Department. “People want to see transparency. They’ve seen that there was corruption at the FBI, and frankly they ought to be working to help us root out bad apples.”\n\nScalise also drew notice when he pitched the idea of forcing Democrats to vote on their controversial proposal to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the Republican Study Committee, garnering praise from rank and file. McCarthy allies said the idea to force such a vote was his idea, not Scalise’s.\n\nBeyond that, Scalise’s full-on embrace of all things Trump has become increasingly glaring. He often goes on Fox News to defend the president. And during an interview aboard his chartered plane between campaign stops, Scalise backed Trump’s tough talk on trade and his posture toward Russia — typically touchy subjects for Republicans. At one point during the day, Scalise compared Trump to Ronald Reagan, a revered figure in the GOP.\n\n\"[There are] tangible signs that Trump's policies are working,\" said Scalise, who put the GOP's odds of keeping the House at \"better than 50-50.\" \"Ultimately, a strong economy with candidates and incumbents who know what’s coming at them is going to hold us [in] the majority.\"\n\nIn Reed’s district that day, Scalise dodged a New York reporter’s question about whether he’d change his mind about backing McCarthy and launch a bid for speaker. Instead, he touted Reed's reelection as though the GOP's majority was riding on it.\n\n“If we lose Tom Reed’s district, we lost the majority,” he said, talking up Reed’s work on tax reform as part of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. “We cut taxes and we’re making America great again. … And Nancy Pelosi wants to reverse that clock. Are we going to let her take it back?”\n\n\"No!” the crowd shouted.\n\nStill, the leadership race was never far from the surface. A woman at the Katko barbecue prodded a Scalise staffer about whether he’d take the helm of the conference next year. And some constituents openly admitted they were there to get a glimpse of a possible future GOP leader.\n\n“He has the potential to be speaker of the House if the Republicans hold on,” said William Shugarts, a retired professor at Reed’s event. “A lot of people have been pushing that, so I thought I’d come and see what he has to say.”", "clickbait": null}

The ICC's chief magistrate said in November that the body would look into allegations of torture and other abuses by Americans in the country. The sanctions could include barring members of the court from entering the U.S.\n\nBolton also warned the ICC not to investigate actions by Israel's security forces against the Palestinians that critics have called war crimes. \"While the court welcomes the membership of the so-called State of Palestine,” Bolton said, “it has threatened Israel — a liberal democratic nation — with investigation into its actions in the West Bank and Gaza to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks.”\n\n“[W]e will not allow the ICC or any other organization to constrain Israel’s right to self-defense,” Bolton added.

Earlier this year, Trump infuriated Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv — an affront to Palestinians who would claim at least part of Jerusalem for their future capital.\n\nPalestinian officials on Monday quickly rebuked the Trump administration. “We reiterate that the rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale, that we will not succumb to US threats and bullying and that we will continue our legitimate struggle for freedom, justice, and independence, including by all political and legal means possible,” a top Palestinian official, Saeb Erekat, said in a statement.\n\nThe Palestinian ambassador to the U.S., Husam Zomlot — who was recalled by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in May, shortly after the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem — blasted the administration’s announcement Monday.\n\nSpeaking of the PLO office closure, Zomlot said: “Such a reckless act confirms that the administration is blindly executing Israel’s ‘wish list,’ which starts with shutting down Palestinian diplomatic representation in the US.”\n\n“We stand firm in our decision not to cooperate in this ongoing campaign to liquidate our rights and cause,” Zomlot said in a statement. “Our rights are not for sale and we will block any attempts at bullying and blackmailing us to forgo our legitimate and internationally endorsed rights.”\n\nIn an apparent reference to the ICC, Zomlot added that Palestinians will \"step up our efforts to hold Israel accountable under international law.\"\n\n“[T]he PLO has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. “To the contrary, PLO leadership has condemned a U.S. peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the U.S. government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise.”\n\n“The United States continues to believe that direct negotiations between the two parties are the only way forward. This action should not be exploited by those who seek to act as spoilers to distract from the imperative of reaching a peace agreement,” Nauert added.\n\nThe administration’s rebuke of the ICC aligns with Bolton’s longstanding aversion to international institutions he views as violating American sovereignty. As an official in the George W. Bush administration in the 2000s, Bolton led opposition to U.S. membership in the ICC.\n\nIn his speech, Bolton laced into the court for what he called its vague definitions of criminality, lack of accountability and spurious claims of authority.\n\n“The United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court,” Bolton said. “We will not cooperate with the ICC, we will provide no assistance to the ICC, and we certainly will not join the ICC.”\n\nA representative for Human Rights Watch on Monday lambasted Bolton's moves against the court as showing \"callous disregard for victims of atrocity crimes.\"\n\nLiz Evenson, associate international justice director for HRW, said in a statement: \"Any US action to scuttle ICC inquiries on Afghanistan and Palestine would demonstrate that the administration was more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers — and deflecting scrutiny of US conduct in Afghanistan — than supporting impartial justice.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Monday that, should the ICC open investigations into U.S. activity in Afghanistan, the administration would consider negotiating agreements to prevent nations from surrendering Americans to the court, and attempt to “constrain the Court’s sweeping powers” through the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThe administration would also weigh banning ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the U.S., sanctioning their funds, and prosecuting them in American courts, Sanders said.\n\nThe administration’s announcement comes days before the 25th anniversary of the Oslo Accords on Sept. 13. Those accords are generally considered the beginning of the formal Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which many experts and diplomats have pronounced dead.\n\nThe UN General Assembly will also convene later this month in New York for its 73rd annual session, with Trump set to preside over a meeting of the UN Security Council expected to focus, in part, on Iran.", "clickbait": null}

John Hickenlooper and other state officials late Tuesday, reigniting a debate over religious freedoms in the public square.\n\nJack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop claims in his lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver, that the state has renewed its “crusade” against him for refusing to create a cake that would have violated his religious beliefs.\n\nAccording to the suit, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that he once again violated the state’s nondiscrimination law when he refused to bake the cake. This time, it was for Autumn Scardina, an Arvada woman celebrating her birthday and the seventh anniversary of her gender transition.\n\nThe commission’s June opinion came despite Phillips’ earlier win at the U.S. Supreme Court over his refusal to make a cake for a gay wedding, the lawsuit says.\n\n“The state of Colorado is ignoring the message of the U.S. Supreme Court by continuing to single out Jack for punishment and to exhibit hostility toward his religious beliefs,” said Kristen Waggoner, legal vice president of Alliance Defending Freedom, the organization representing Phillips.\n\nHowever, the justices’ 7-2 decision in the cake maker’s earlier case was a narrow ruling that kept the state’s nondiscrimination laws intact but said the state commission did not appropriately weigh Phillips’ religious rights.\n\nHickenlooper told reporters Wednesday that he was not involved the commission’s most recent ruling, but said the issue is one of the most thorny he has seen during his public service career. He said he expects the issue to return to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“The first ruling from the Supreme Court did not address the basic issue,” he said, referring to the religious freedom issue, “and that’s what I think the U.S. Supreme Court will have to address this time.”\n\nThe Civil Rights Commission and attorney general’s office declined to comment Wednesday. Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican, has long been a supporter of the LGBTQ community.\n\nTuesday’s lawsuit reignites years of legal debate over how religious beliefs should be considered under Colorado’s public accommodation law. The 2008 state law forbids businesses from discriminating against customers on a variety of grounds including sexual orientation and gender.\n\nPhillips and his cake shop first made national news in 2012, when he declined to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of his religious objections to same-sex marriage. The years-long legal fight ended at the U.S. Supreme Court this June in a decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy, who has authored a number of landmark rulings expanding gay rights, indicated that the decision was not all-encompassing.\n\nAt the time, observers on both sides of the case said the limited decision meant the broader debate would continue to be litigated.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Scardina, a lawyer, filed a complaint with the commission claiming that the cake shop denied her request for a cake — blue on the outside and pink on the inside to represent her transition.\n\nA store employee declined the request because the custom cake would have expressed messages about sex and gender identity that conflict with Phillips’ religious beliefs, according to Scardina’s complaint with the Civil Rights Commission.\n\n“The woman on the phone did not object to my request for a birthday cake until I told her I was celebrating my transition from male to female,” Scardina wrote in her complaint. “I believe that I was not allowed to order a birthday cake because I requested that its colors celebrate my transition.”\n\nScardina on Wednesday did not return requests to comment.\n\nIn a June 28 decision letter, the commission wrote that there was probable cause to believe Masterpiece violated a state law by denying Scardina “equal enjoyment of a place of public accommodation.” The letter ordered the bakery and Scardina to attempt an amicable resolution by compulsory mediation, according to Phillips’ legal team.\n\nJim Campbell, another lawyer for Phillips, said in a statement that Phillips shouldn’t have to fear government hostility when he opens his shop for business each day.\n\n“We’re asking the court to put a stop to that,” Campbell said. “The arbitrary basis on which the state is applying its law makes clear that its officials are targeting Jack because they despise his religious beliefs and practices.”\n\nOne Colorado, the state’s largest LGBTQ advocacy organization, said the new lawsuit was one of several filed in an effort to legalize discrimination.\n\n“All people — including LGBTQ people — deserve to be served equally in public spaces, and no religious belief gives anyone the right to pick and choose whom they serve and what laws they want to follow,” Daniel Ramos, One Colorado’s executive director, said in a statement. “This is another attempt by the ADF to undermine laws that protect Coloradans in the areas of public accommodations, employment, and housing.”\n\nEarlier this year, the state’s civil rights commission became a political flashpoint during the state’s regular legislative session. Some conservative lawmakers attempted to shut down the commission in part because of its role in the Masterpiece cake controversy.\n\nUltimately, Hickenlooper signed a bipartisan compromise that extended the commission through 2027 and changed the makeup of the commission, requiring it be more bipartisan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the governor denounced discrimination, saying “it’s not what America stands for.” He also stressed that he understood the value of a person’s religion freedom.\n\n“This is a difficult question. When you’re talking about people’s religion, it doesn’t matter what religion, it’s one of the most tightly held American freedoms that we have,” he said. “It’s why millions of people fought and lost their lives.”", "clickbait": null}

Or that Cory Booker’s “Spartacus” uprising amounted to a demand for documents that had already been authorized for release.\n\nOne thing Democrats are learning from President Donald Trump as the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh draw to a close: Floating an incendiary charge, with little to no factual basis, can draw the spotlight and force the opposition to prove a negative.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the run-up to 2020, it isn’t the details that resonate with base voters. It’s the show.\n\nDemocrats were never expected to derail Kavanaugh’s nomination in a Republican-held Congress. But his confirmation hearings served as a test for Harris and Booker ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign. And in a pre-primary measured in social media mentions and YouTube-ready moments, Harris and Booker this week came out ahead.\n\nTheir handling of the hearings wasn’t in the same category as some of Trump’s prevarications. But both Democrats showed, during their first high court hearings on the Judiciary Committee, that they too know how to elate their base and wound opponents without an airtight case.\n\nFrom the opening minute of the hearings, Harris muscled to the forefront, kicking off Democrats’ protest on Tuesday by charging that “we have not been given the opportunity to have a meaningful hearing.” She successfully challenged Kavanaugh on the deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as gay marriage, voting rights and abortion.\n\n“Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?” the former prosecutor asked at one point, causing Kavanaugh to stammer.\n\nThe next day, Harris featured the exchange in an email fundraising appeal, while running Kavanaugh-related ads on Facebook throughout the week.\n\n“If you’re with me in this fight, can you sign my petition opposing Judge Kavanagh’s nomination to the Supreme Court as Republicans rush through his confirmation hearings this week?” said one ad running Thursday.\n\nThe ad featured a photograph of Harris next to bold type reading, “Stop Brett Kavanaugh!”\n\nBut Harris puzzled observers when she pointedly asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe with anyone at a law firm that has long represented Trump. Kavanaugh was initially unable to answer the question, before definitively saying Thursday that he had not had such a discussion. Having never followed up on what she described as a “reliable” lead on the matter, Harris’ bid to undercut the nominee seemed to lack a firm foundation by the end of the committee’s marathon hearing.\n\nWhen it comes to exposure, however, the confrontation with Kavanaugh was a success. A C-SPAN video of the exchange posted on social media had nearly 6.5 million views as of Friday morning. The radio host Jerry Quickley played a clip of the exchange on the leftist KPFK radio station in Los Angeles, to which a caller glowed, “That senator was great!”\n\nFor Harris, the anti-Kavanaugh campaign had its intended effect. Her fans swooned.\n\n“Dear @senjudiciary, where do we send @KamalaHarris all the mics to drop?” the comedian Samantha Bee wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnd Harris’ doggedness, for many in her party, mattered more than her ultimate lack of evidence to back up her questioning.\n\nOne Democratic aide pointed to Kavanaugh’s own “evasive and tortured answer on the first day of hearings” as the reason that Harris and other Democrats kept digging in about the Trump-connected law firm.\n\n“If he had just given a straightforward answer to a simple question, he could have saved everyone a lot of time,” the aide said.\n\nHarris has spent more than a year raising her profile by confronting the president’s nominees, starting with her vote against the confirmation of John Kelly to head the Department of Homeland Security. She was one of only 11 senators to oppose Kelly’s confirmation, and she attracted another round of attention when Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told her at a confirmation hearing last year to be more “courteous” on the dais.\n\nWhile Harris and Booker appeared only to cheer their Democratic base, Republicans saw a longer-term opening for a future counter-attack. Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant who has long opposed Trump, criticized Democrats for adopting a tone that he said mirrored the president himself.\n\n“Listening to the junior Senator/Presidential candidate from CA,” Murphy said on Twitter. “The sneering tone of many of these questions from D’s on the Judiciary Committee is really offensive. Amazing how they can (correctly) condemn Trump for his tone yet act like this.”\n\nYet Harris’ Republican colleagues were relatively restrained in their response to her opaque inquiry. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) even rephrased her questions in an attempt to make it easier for Kavanaugh to answer — a seeming nod to their effectiveness.\n\nIf Booker had an opening to overshadow Harris, it appeared to come Thursday, when he vowed to release once-confidential records from Kavanaugh’s years in the George W. Bush White House. In what he likened to an “‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” Booker said he would risk expulsion from the Senate to release the documents himself.\n\nBut Republicans said the records had already been cleared for release, and the GOP spent days mocking the New Jersey senator.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) quipped after Booker let loose his confidential-documents gambit that “running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,” while Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) made a subtle joke Wednesday about Booker’s lengthy monologues.\n\nJudiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), known for his dry humor, asked Booker at one point “how long you’re going to say the same thing three or four times.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee distributed a memo criticizing Booker under the subject line, “Spartacus Of Newark’s Performance History,” and Sen. Marco Rubio, (R-Fla.) ridiculed Booker on Twitter.\n\n“On this day in 71B.C. the Thracian gladiator Spartacus was put to death by Marcus Licinius Crassus for disclosing confidential scrolls,” he wrote. “When informed days later that in fact the Roman Senate had already publicly released the scrolls, Crassus replied ‘Oh, ok, my bad.’”\n\nThe conservative opposition group America Rising kept a running tally of how many minutes of his own questioning time Booker used to speak, which dwarfed the number of minutes the nominee spent responding. Gayle Trotter, a spokeswoman for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, urged red-state Democrats to reject the “embarrassing performance” by their liberal colleagues on the panel, singling out Booker and Harris.\n\nBooker sought to wear the criticism as a badge of honor, telling CNN on Thursday night that Cornyn had leveled a “deep insult” by calling his conduct unbecoming for a senator. He said he persisted because “I was raised and taught that an unjust law, you almost have an obligation to stand against it.”\n\nHe also contended that he had first broken the rules as early as Wednesday night, when referencing then-confidential records while questioning Kavanaugh. And after the GOP revealed Booker’s initial document release had it in fact been confidential, he followed up by releasing more confidential records.\n\nWhile confusion over the documents’ release left Booker with a less-than-clean hit, Democrats outside the hearing room delighted at his tactics. The Women’s March, a group that galvanized progressive activists following Trump’s election, hailed Booker for “modeling exactly what we expect of every member of the Senate.” The Texas Democratic Party updated its announcement of Booker’s planned appearance at the party’s Johnson-Jordan dinner on Saturday to include praise for him “showing political courage by releasing confidential documents” in the hearings.\n\nHarris and Booker are among a growing number of Democrats who have pledged to no longer accept money from corporate political action committees, and the publicity from a week of nationally televised hearings could help them broaden their followings in the run-up to 2020. Harris has spent heavily to court small-dollar supporters online.\n\nYet in an era of short attention spans and non-stop news from Washington, it is unclear how enduring such a lift might prove.\n\nPaul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster, said, “We could have seven new stories that fly in the middle of everything, and Kavanaugh could be forgotten in 24 hours.”\n\n", "clickbait": null}

I kind of feel like, ‘Oh no, you have to be in the camp that says sexism isn’t real.’”\n\nBut, she added, that’s far from true.\n\n“There’s certainly a double standard for women in this realm,” said Stuckey, who wrote the popular “Conservative Millennial” blog before becoming a Conservative Review TV host. “Because it’s not just about what we say, it’s about how we say it.”\n\nStuckey, whose online videos have racked up millions of views and hundreds of thousands of followers, is no stranger to harassment on the internet or on the airwaves. But she says females’ responses are consistently cast in a sexist light.\n\n“If we get into a conflict on air, it’s not just that it was heated; it was that it was a cat fight, or she freaked out about something,” said Stuckey, who is a frequent commentator on Fox News. “There are constantly evaluations about how we look, comparing us to other women. Just because we might have the same hair color, we might think the same.”\n\n“I do get a lot of hate,” she added. “And I think as a conservative, people assume that as a conservative I don’t acknowledge sexism, or I say there’s no double standard, or sexism doesn’t exist. Well, that’s certainly not where I am.”\n\nStuckey, who also hosts a podcast called “Relatable,” rose to prominence among conservatives for her takes on culture and politics from a millennial perspective that also focuses largely on her faith.\n\nIn recent months, the 26-year-old stepped into the national spotlight with a parody video where she conducted a fake interview with congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was slammed by some media outlets for not explicitly labeling itself as satire.\n\nBut on the Women Rule podcast, Stuckey hit back at her critics.\n\n“It surprised me,” she said. “A lot of people on the left just can’t tolerate someone on the right making a joke, because the only humor now that is protected is humor that is against conservatives or against President Trump.”\n\n“If you say something bad about Trump, about the first family, about conservatives, you can be as vulgar, as mean, as hateful as possible and people are still going to laugh and it’s going to be okay. But if you make a lighthearted, clean joke about someone on the left, then you are going to get dragged through the mud by The Washington Post.”\n\nTo hear more about Allie Beth Stuckey’s rise to conservative media fame and who she looks up to in the Republican party, listen to the full podcast here.

All but one were from the high-tax Democratic states of New York, New Jersey and California.\n\nIf successful in the House, the legislation would not likely be taken up in the Senate soon, though experts believe provisions on retirement savings and tax assistance for start-up companies could find bipartisan support eventually.\n\nDubbed “Tax Reform 2.0”, the House package is intended to augment President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul, which added $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit by providing permanent tax cuts for U.S. corporations, but only temporary individual tax cuts that are set to expire after 2025.\n\nRepublicans insist Trump’s tax overhaul and actions to deregulate industry are boosting the economy. But that has been undercut on the campaign trail by worries about Trump’s policy on trade tariffs and a lack of evidence that tax cuts have delivered promised pay increases to workers.\n\nDemocrats, who opposed last year’s bill, have also cast Republican tax cuts as a giveaway to big corporations and the rich that will lead to cuts in Social Security and Medicare, claims that Republicans deny.\n\nThe new legislation would add another $576 billion to the deficit, even taking potentially higher economic growth into account, the Tax Foundation said.\n\nThat number could rise if Republicans made an estimated $1.1 trillion in individual tax cuts permanent, but scaled back or eliminated the SALT deduction cap, which is a revenue raiser.\n\n“If this were likely to be enacted in the near term, those numbers would be difficult to square,” said David Noren, a tax partner with the law firm McDermott, Will & Emery.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the 2.0 package’s main author, plans to unveil draft language for three bills early in the week and put it to a committee-level vote on Thursday, with a full House vote following by Oct 1.\n\nAside from making individual tax cuts permanent, Republicans say the legislation will including savings provisions intended to help small businesses offer 401(k) retirement plans, allow 529 education savings plans to pay for apprenticeships and provide access to retirement savings for costs related to births and adoptions.\n\nRepublicans say the legislation will also seek to encourage start-up businesses by allowing them to write off more start-up costs and add investors without limiting tax benefits, such as research and development credits.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The U.S. Capitol is pictured on the opening day of the 112th United States Congress in Washington, January 5, 2011.

Or perhaps you would have worried about the limits and biases of the mainstream media.\n\nBut in the digital age, when speech can exist mostly unfettered, the big threat to truth looks very different. It’s not just censorship, but an avalanche of undistinguished speech—some true, some false, some fake, some important, some trivial, much of it out-of-context, all burying us.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor the longest time, we thought that as speech became more democratized, democracy itself would flourish. As more and more people could broadcast their words and opinions, there would be an ever-fiercer battle of ideas—with truth emerging as the winner, stronger from the fight. But in 2018, it is increasingly clear that more speech can in fact threaten democracy. The glut of information we now face, made possible by digital tools and social media platforms, can bury what is true, greatly elevate and amplify misinformation and distract from what is important.\n\nDeluged by apparent facts, arguments and counterarguments, our brains resort to the most obvious filter, the easiest cognitive shortcut for a social animal: We look to our peers, see what they believe and cheer along. As a result, open and participatory speech has turned into its opposite. Important voices are silenced by mobs of trolls using open platforms to hurl abuse and threats. Bogus news shared from one friend or follower to the next becomes received wisdom. Crucial pieces of information drown in so much irrelevance that they are lost. If books were burned in the street, we would be alarmed. Now, we are simply exhausted.\n\nIt’s not speech per se that allows democracies to function, but the ability to agree—eventually, at least some of the time—on what is true, what is important and what serves the public good. This doesn’t mean everyone must agree on every fact, or that our priorities are necessarily uniform. But democracy can’t operate completely unmoored from a common ground, and certainly not in a sea of distractions.\n\nHow can we get back to that common ground? We need new mechanisms—suited to the digital age—that allow for a shared understanding of facts and that focus our collective attention on the most important problems. That might sound nebulous or difficult or even impossible in the current chaos. But consider that the modern state or today’s public health systems also seemed difficult or impossible at many points in human history.

I used to work at a grocery store, and a couple of Russian teenagers are checking out at my register.

My friend and I are both fluent in Russian and English, but we primarily speak English. One day, while we were at a museum, we got bored and decided to go up and down the glass elevator. We kept giggling, making jokes, and it was a great time until some woman with her family got in. She quickly chose her floor and remarked to her family (in Russian) that we were acting stupid and were ugly. As she got out of the elevator, my friend and I yelled out (also in Russian) \"Have a nice day!\" and the look on her face is one I will never forget. —sleepingoctopi\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. This very mature comeback: OK so my parents are both Indian and I look very Indian. There's no indication from my appearance that I would speak French AT ALL. So I got into a lift at my apartment complex and these two men walked into the escalators, speaking in French about VERY RACIST stuff. So when the lift got to their floor, I held the lift door open and gave them a piece of my mind, ending with a polite and charming “bonne journée!” before closing the door of the lift. They literally had their jaws drop to the floor. They were so uncomfortable and I felt very proud of myself that day! —manasvinib\n\n5. This annoyed retail worker: I work in retail and live in an area with a high density of Filipinos. I was born and raised in the US, but understand and speak the language. Two Filipino ladies came in and started looking around. I greeted them and asked where they were from. Then they asked me where I was from because I look Filipino. But because I’m born in the US, I don’t have the accent. So when I said I was from the US, they said to each other that I was dumb for not knowing the language, that my parents are stupid for not teaching me, and that kids like me make the country look bad. Then they asked me for a product in a size that we didn’t have. When I went to start her transaction, she started getting angry about how everything was so expensive, that I’m stupid, and how I obviously don’t know what I’m doing. So after I finished her transaction, I told her to have a good day in our language and she looked at her friend, then back at me, and walked away. Her face when I spoke the language to her was definitely worth it. —123adrienne\n\n6. This awkward nail salon experience: One time, I went to this Vietnamese nail salon and had a pedicure. I walked in and said that I'd like to have a pedicure please. They didn't expect a thing and thought I'm just another mixed Asian kid who doesn't know Vietnamese. The lady that I had was like, \"Yeah I'm good, will do\". Right away, she started to gossip with the lady next to her about how I have a beard and ugly-ass toes. I immediately told her that I know Vietnamese, in Vietnamese, and the look on her face was hilarious. —t44aa36efc\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. This satisfying plot twist: I speak English and Italian fluently so I don’t get many of these experiences living in the US, but it happened one time, when I was at JFK airport in the check-in line on my way to Rome to visit my family. I had standby tickets because my uncle is a flight attendant. I got to the front of the line and a lady calls us to her and while we’re taking out our passports. Soon after, she was saying things like “Why do these stupid people always come to me.” and “Ugh, this bitch can’t even dress. What’s the matter with her husband? What a dumbass.” in Italian. Her supervisor didn’t even respond, probably because he knows better than to do that. So while she kept talking shit about us, I got a call from my mom, who I only speak Italian to. I smiled and talked in Italian (nice and loud for the lady to hear), “Hi mom! Yeah we’re getting our tickets right now. Tell Nonna I said hi and we’ll see her in the morning. Ok, bye!” I look up at the lady and her eyes were wide open and her mouth just dropped. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone so mortified. Her supervisor looked so pissed off at her. He took our tickets and said “Oh cazzo!”, which means \"oh shit!”. He then said, “Stefania! That’s Diego’s niece.” To which she looked even worse because my uncle worked for the company for YEARS and is well known and liked. —saraf46cbcaf4c\n\n8. This situation with nosey diners: Since I grew up in America, no one thought I spoke Kannada. Once in India, my grandparents took me and my brother out to eat. We cannot drink tap water so we kept having to order bottled water. I guess the table nearby heard my grandma explain that we were foreign and the woman sitting there said, \"What do you think? Are they spoiled brats or too weak to handle the spice?\" As I walked out, I made sure to ask my Grandma something in Kannada and glare at the woman. —melonette000\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. This failed assumption: While I was born and raised in Malaysia, I prefer speaking English with some of my friends because it's a habit my family instilled into me at a young age. I went on a short vacation in a small state area. I was on the phone with my friend and was waiting in line at a food stall when two young women behind me said some stuff in my mother tongue out loud. \"Do you think she can speak our language? She's gonna' take longer time to order because she doesn't even know what they sell here. These tourists are so annoying!\" she said. After getting off the phone, I purposely ordered in Bahasa Malaysia, loud and clear for those women in the back, complete in the state's dialect as well. Needless to say, those women stood as far as possible from me afterwards. —heraf\n\n10. This priceless interaction at the zoo: I was at the zoo with my son when I was 39 weeks pregnant with my second son. Two Spanish speaking teenage girls made fun of how slow I was and said that I walked like a cow. The look on their faces was priceless when they heard me speak to my son in Spanish. I really enjoyed their embarrassment and was sure to flash them the bitchiest smile I could muster. —tenfoldsnails\n\n11. This awkward wait for the flight: I speak Norwegian, which means I can pretty much understand Swedish and Danish. I had been sitting at the Denver airport waiting for my flight to London when a group of about ten Danes started sitting around me. I had already been sitting there for a good two hours and by the time this family came around, the seats at the gate were all taken. A few of the family members got seats and a few had to sit on the floor. They started making nasty comments about all the people around them and in general calling Americans fat and stupid. It wasn't long before their comments were pointed in my direction. They were complaining that I was such a bitch because I had not gotten up to let them sit together. I was at the end of a row so it's not like they had to sit on either side of me. Then they started saying that I was only pretending to read the book because \"Americans are too stupid to read.\" The funny thing was, I was reading a Norwegian book. So when I heard this, I adjusted my book so they could see the title. Once they realized I probably understood them, they started trying to pretend they were talking about someone else. I got to board before them, so when I stood up I told them in Norwegian they can have my seat now. They all seemed extremely embarrassed. —kristinb456001448\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. This person who shut down a whole group of people: I was in France with on an exchange trip. At school, my partner’s friends were calling me the “dumb American” and saying how I “probably didn’t even know what they were saying\", and making fun of my small size. I laughed along, but just quietly added that I could understand them. The look on their faces was priceless. They didn’t make fun of me anymore. —ptoe\n\n13. This ultimate win: A few years ago, I was backpacking through Peru with a few friends. From the moment we arrived, we realised that everybody assumed we were American (we are Belgian) and that we did not speak any Spanish (all of us did). So we decided to use those assumptions to our advantage when negotiating on prices and such. About a week in, we were trying to arrange a hiking trip to the Colca Canyon. We overheard one of the people at the agency tell his co-worker to charge us triple of their normal asking price \"because these Americans are filthy rich anyway\". Naturally, we immediately switched to Spanish to let them know we heard and understood everything. They were so mortified we only had to pay half of the normal asking price. —elodied49a59e38e\n\n14. And finally, this wholesome customer: I walked into a take-out restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island just minutes before closing time. Immediately the two employees started talking to each other in Spanish, viciously complaining about me walking in and expecting service so late. THEY. WERE. FURIOUS. Foul language and all. Then they proceed to ask me in English what I wanted , so I give them my order in my native language, Spanish. The poor girls immediately bury their face in their hands, and apologize to me saying they were actually talking about someone else they served before me. One of the girls was so embarrassed she was about to cry. I told them not to worry and that I understood their frustration. They had been working non-stop all day long. I would be tired and pissed too. I left a 20% tip, thanked them for the food and went home. —n499ae0620\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote: Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.\n\nWant to be featured in similar BuzzFeed posts?

( 83 )\n\nA first concern after a breast cancer diagnosis is often about survival—beating the disease. The medical term for how long you will live after diagnosis is your \"prognosis.\" For many women, the prognosis is good. More than 8 of 10 women diagnosed and treated for breast cancer are still alive 10 years later.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding \"Five-Year Survival Rates\"\n\nThe stage of your breast cancer is a measure of how advanced the cancer is. This helps determine treatment. It also affects the estimate of your prognosis.\n\nBreast cancer stages go from 0 to 4. They're often written in Roman numerals, I to IV. Stage 0 means the cancer has not spread beyond the breast. Stage IV means the cancer has spread outside the breast to other parts of the body.\n\nWilliam C. Lloyd III, MD, FACS Medical Reviewers: Last Review Date: 2017 May 12 2018 Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. All rights reserved. May not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\n\n\n\nDoctors who study and treat breast cancer use five-year survival rates when talking about prognosis. They assign each stage a five-year survival rate. The five-year survival rate is a measure of how likely a woman with breast cancer is to survive five years after diagnosis, compared to a woman in the general population without breast cancer. There are many variables that affect the five-year survival rate within each cancer stage.\n\nHowever, here's a general way to think about five-year survival rates:\n\nFor stage 0 and stage I cancers, the expected five-year survival is 100%. This means the person with breast cancer is just as likely as a person without breast cancer to survive five years beyond their diagnosis.\n\nFor stage II cancer, when cells have not spread outside the breast, the average five-year survival is 99%.\n\nFor stage III cancer, when cells have spread but not far beyond the breast, the average five-year survival is 85%.\n\nFor stage IV cancer, when cells have spread to other parts of the body, the average five-year survival is 26%. This means the person with breast cancer is 26% as likely as a person without breast cancer to survive five years beyond their diagnosis.\n\nWhat’s Your Prognosis?\n\nIt's very important to know that five-year survival rates are only averages. Many people who survive five years will continue to survive for many more years. Your personal prognosis depends on more than your cancer stage. Other factors that can influence your prognosis are:\n\nYour age\n\nYour overall health\n\nThe type of cancer cells you have\n\nHow you respond to your treatment\n\nFor more information, ask your oncologist about how these factors affect your individual prognosis, including how your specific type of cancer may respond to treatment.\n\nIn general, breast cancer prognosis is improving every year. The number of people dying from breast cancer has been going down steadily since 1989. There are close to three million American women living today who survived breast cancer.", "clickbait": null}

Only one family member, then-3-year-old Vanessa, survived, but with severe facial injuries.\n\nThe Colorado Bureau of Investigation previously submitted a DNA profile taken from frozen evidence from Smith’s murder to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System.

The killer had sexually assaulted Smith and days later Debra Bennett and her young daughter.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, The Denver Post received a tip that a DNA match had recently been made between the suspect in the Lakewood and Aurora killings and a prison inmate in Nevada. The tip included the prison booking number and the name of the offender serving a lengthy prison term for attempted murder and use of a deadly weapon.\n\nBrooke Santina, spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Corrections, said she could not comment on any link between the Nevada inmate and the Colorado murder cases. Santina confirmed that an inmate matching the name and prisoner number The Post provided is incarcerated in Nevada and is eligible for parole in 2021.\n\nWhen asked whether authorities had made a DNA match between the specific Nevada inmate and DNA taken from Colorado murder victims, Santina said she had been in contact Tuesday with Arapahoe County authorities and was awaiting their approval before commenting.\n\nDenver TV station 9News reported Tuesday that multiple law enforcement sources confirmed that they are looking at a suspect who is being held in another state.\n\nAurora police spokesman Bill Hummel declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nThe alleged suspect in the case has been convicted of previous crimes, including attempted murder, use of a deadly weapon, burglary and aggravated escape.\n\nThe description of the Nevada inmate matches some aspects of a genetic snapshot of the 1984 suspect produced by Parabon NanoLabs, a Virginia company that created a profile using DNA predictions of the suspect’s ancestry, eye color, hair color, freckling and face shape.\n\nIn June 2002, then-Arapahoe County District Attorney Jim Peters obtained a John Doe arrest warrant in the Bennett killings based on the DNA. Peters charged John Doe with 18 counts, including three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of sexual assault, first-degree assault and two counts of sexual assault on a child and burglary.\n\nThe same killer is believed to have first struck Jan. 4, 1984, when he slipped inside an Aurora home and used a hammer to beat James and Kimberly Haubenschild.

Only 1,642 of them, or about 60 percent, have been positively identified.\n\nThe New York City Medical Examiner’s Office has worked for 17 years to identify the remaining 1,100 victims. Using advances in DNA extraction techniques over the past five years, it has made five more identifications.\n\nThe advances have been bittersweet for 9/11 families who unsuccessfully fought to stop the city from making a park out of Staten Island’s enormous Fresh Kills landfill, where 1.8 million tons of Twin Towers debris was dumped and buried.\n\n“We are grateful that the identification continues, but there is more material that could have been part of that had the city not been so cavalier with us,” said Diane Horning, who led a failed court battle by a group called World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial that hoped block the park project.\n\nHorning led the group, although her son Matthew was one of those identified early on. Matthew, 26, a database administrator for an insurance company, was working the 95th floor of the North Tower when the planes hit.\n\nNew York’s Second Circuit Court of Appeals found in 2009 that accusations that the city had mishandled the remains at Fresh Kills amounted to “lack of due care,” which was not sufficient to successfully sue the city.\n\nAndrew Schweighardt holds a vial with a DNA sample at the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York during an event in New York City, New York, U.S., September 6, 2018. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nNew York officials said at the time that the city did not intend to be insensitive or offend victims’ families.\n\nTo create the park, Fresh Kills Landfill was covered with layers of soil and other materials to prevent the release of toxic gas from decomposing trash into the atmosphere, according to the Freshkills Park Alliance, New York City’s nonprofit partner in developing the park.\n\nCharles Wolf lost his wife Katherine on September 11 and her remains have not been identified.\n\nIf they are in the sealed landfill, he considers it “God’s will” and he is “at peace” with it.\n\n“What’s the remedy? Dig everything up and risk exposing all those toxins again to the environment?, Wolf said. “No, that’s not the answer, because all of a sudden now the cure is worse than the disease.”\n\nSCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH\n\nThe ability to identify more victims is the latest chapter in a saga of pain that began on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when two airliners crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.\n\nDestruction of the Twin Towers was part of the coordinated hijackings of four airliners by al-Qaeda militants that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and western Pennsylvania, where one of the planes crashed in a farm field. The attacks triggered an escalation of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East that persists to this day.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nA scientific breakthrough in the extraction of genetic material was made this year and announced by the New York City chief medical examiner last week, as the 17th anniversary of the attacks approached.\n\nThe new technique places bone fragments in a chamber containing liquid nitrogen to make them more fragile so they can be pulverized into fine powder. The more a bone is pulverized, the more likely it becomes to extract DNA.\n\nIt is the latest effort in the largest forensic investigation in U.S. history, involving a medical examiner’s team of 10 scientists working on remains once thought too degraded from jet fuel, heat and other conditions to undergo testing.\n\n“We’re going back to the same remains that we’ve tried five, 10, 15 times,” Mark Desire, who heads the Medical Examiner’s crime lab, said in the briefing last week.\n\n“We are making DNA profiles from remains we had no hopes of identifying in the past,” he added.\n\nWolf, who was not among those who opposed the Freshkills Park project, was gratified by the renewed effort.\n\n“It warms my heart that possibly there will be remains found for people who still want them,” he said.\n\n“I’ve gone through a lot of trauma with nothing to grieve over,” Wolf said, choking up in a telephone interview. “I remember watching Nancy Reagan touch her husband’s casket. I miss not having that.”", "clickbait": null}

It only happened yesterday,\" he said.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama weighed in on the situation Friday, saying in a speech that the notion that staffers are stealing papers from Trump’s desk and trying to secretly undermine the president is “not normal.”\n\n“These people aren’t elected. They’re not accountable,” said Obama, during a speech at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign billed as the kickoff of his midterm campaigning. “They're not doing us a service by actively promoting 90 percent of the crazy stuff that’s coming out of this White House, and then saying, ‘Don’t worry, we’re preventing the other 10 percent.’ That’s not how things are supposed to work.”\n\nComing on the heels of veteran journalist Bob Woodward’s soon-to-be-published book on the chaos in the administration, the op-ed has unleashed a new wave of paranoia and anxiety in the West Wing, which was still dealing with the aftermath of former aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman’s release of secret tapes she made during the 2016 campaign and as a White House staffer.\n\nTrump has repeatedly encouraged Sessions to probe specific topics or political rivals. Last weekend, Trump questioned why the DOJ filed charges against two sitting GOP lawmakers and early Trump endorsers, Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York, so late in the election cycle that the party could not replace them on the ballot before November.\n\nAddressing one of the anecdotes from Woodward’s book on Friday, Trump cast doubt on the idea that former National Economic Council director Gary Cohn stole a draft letter off his desk that would have signaled America’s intent to withdraw from a trade deal with South Korea.\n\n“He never took a memo off my desk. Gary Cohn, if he ever took a memo off my desk, I would have fired him in two seconds,” Trump said. “He would have been fired so fast.”\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

And he’s worried about his job.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe 48-year-old assistant roller at NLMK Pennsylvania says President Donald Trump’s steel tariffs have driven up costs for his company and left everyone at his western Pennsylvania plant — deep in the heart of Trump country — on edge.\n\n“Trump’s supposed to be making America great again, right? Why isn’t he creating more jobs here instead of taking jobs away?” Southward said in a new edition of the POLITICO Money podcast.\n\nSouthward spoke from his spot in the “pulpit,” a control room high above a conveyor belt that presses 10-inch-thick steel slabs into thin, rolled coils for resale. “We just want it to go away, man, so we can continue with our jobs. That’s all that’s talked about around here anymore.”\n\nStories like that of NLMK are playing out across the country from Iowa soybean farmers slammed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs to Michigan auto industry workers worried about the metal tariffs and the impact of proposed levies on imported cars and parts.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAs troubling headlines about the impact of tariffs pile up, Trump is preaching patience, repeatedly arguing that tariffs are “the greatest” and will eventually lead to better trade deals while reviving the steel industry and boosting U.S. automakers.\n\n“Just be a little patient,” he told farmers in Kansas City, Missouri, last month around the time he announced a $12 billion federal bailout for agricultural exporters hit by the fallout.\n\nBut patience is quickly running thin at places like NLMK, which buys steel on the world market. Company president and CEO Bob Miller said NLMK has paid an extra $100 million since Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on imported steel went into effect. He says he can’t buy the steel slabs he needs from domestic sources. And that means higher prices for his customers and ultimately consumers. His pleas to the Commerce Department for an exemption have so far come to nothing.\n\n“On one hand, you might think you’re helping jobs and increasing jobs, but on the other hand, you’re going to affect jobs here,” Miller said. “And I think our 1,200 jobs here in western Pennsylvania are just as important as jobs in Granite City or across this country.” He was referring to a steel plant in Granite City, Illinois, that reopened after the tariffs and received a visit from Trump in July to celebrate.\n\nDemocrats, sensing an opportunity to make inroads into Trump country in the industrial Midwest and farm belt during the midterms, are hammering away at the tariffs.\n\nNLMK lies just to the north of the western Pennsylvania district — which Trump won by more than 20 percentage points — that Democrats wrested back in a surprise special election victory by Conor Lamb in March. Democrat Amy McGrath is hammering incumbent Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) over the impact on Kentucky bourbon. And Democrats are also using tariffs in House races in New Jersey, Iowa and California and Senate races in North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee, among other places.\n\nThe political calculus — largely backed up by most empirical studies on the impact of tariffs — is that Trump’s trade actions will wind up hurting more industries and workers than they help.\n\nOne place they are helping is the Mon Valley Works – Edgar Thomson Plant, a facility owned by U.S. Steel on the banks of the Monongahela River in Braddock, Pennsylvania, that’s been in operation since 1872.\n\nPOLITICO interviewed more than a dozen employees arriving and leaving work and in the surrounding community over a period of two days. None agreed to provide their last names because they were not authorized by U.S. Steel to speak on the record. U.S. Steel executives declined requests for interviews. Most of the workers said they backed Trump in 2016 and were at least generally supportive of the tariffs.\n\n“A lot of people don’t like Trump. But Trump’s the one that’s turning things around the way it should be,” said Steve, a caster water control operator. “Everybody’s got to give it a chance to play out. Like China, they’re guilty. Other countries are guilty. We’ve been giving everybody a break for years upon years.”\n\nDan, who works in the shipping department at the plant, said the tariffs would benefit more than just U.S. Steel. “It’s not just steelworkers benefiting from the tariffs. It’s the food suppliers and the boot suppliers and the clothes suppliers and the parts suppliers that keep us running,” he said. “So it’s a trickle effect, and then our employees and everybody else that works with us make decent money.”\n\nBut even these workers, direct beneficiaries of the steel tariffs in the short run, expressed some concern over Trump’s long-term plan.\n\n“I’m not sure yet. Waiting to see. I don’t think a trade war is good with anybody. You know what I mean?” said Bob, who operates a machine that moves steel around the plant. “So we’ll see what these tariffs do, but I’m undecided on that. It’s too early to tell, OK? It’s good for individual companies — but the overall economy, I don’t know about that.”\n\nDave, who works in maintenance and production, said higher steel prices created by the tariffs might be unsustainable. “I think it’s going to help us in the short run, but I don’t know about in the long run if it’s going to help us,” he said. “The price of steel has doubled since he’s done that, and I don’t know if that’s going to last. Since I’ve been there, it’s never been nowhere near that price. So I’m just skeptical about the whole thing.”\n\nThere was also significant skepticism about Trump’s motivations in applying the tariffs, potentially an early warning sign for the White House, though the president’s overall approval rating among Republicans remains historically high.\n\n“I don’t think anything he does is going to help us,” said Mike, a contractor who does electrical work at the plant. “Everything I think he does is for personal gain.”\n\nThe problem for Trump and the GOP: There are a lot more workers in industries that use steel and aluminum than in companies producing them, tilting both the potential economic and political gains from the tariffs away from him.\n\nEconomist Jed Kolko estimates there are 415,000 jobs in companies that produce steel and aluminum while 4.6 million work in industries that use the metals, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAt NLMK in Braddock, which is owned by Russian steel giant Novolipetsk Steel, workers argue that Trump’s tariffs will indeed wind up hurting more people than they help.\n\n“It’s like a double-edged sword. They probably do need tariffs on certain stuff and it’s helping some people and hurting the other people,” said Robbie Smith, a roller who’s worked at the plant for over 20 years. “It seems like we’re the ones it’s going to hurt if they stick with it.”\n\nMiller, the CEO, said he could handle the tariffs for now, with the economy as strong as it is. But that won’t last forever.\n\n“If we see this market start to slow down and if we see selling prices start to fall, then yes, those jobs are at risk,” he said.", "clickbait": null}

Chiu/AP Photo Politics GOP attacks Obama, but doesn't defend Trump Leading Republicans took issue with the former president's scathing speech, but none disputed that Trump has threatened core American institutions.\n\nTwo days in, lots of prominent Republicans have complained about Barack Obama’s speech on Friday calling Donald Trump’s presidency a betrayal of America and a threat to its core — but they haven’t said he’s wrong.\n\nMost prominent on that list is Trump himself, who, for a man his aides have often held up as someone who punches back, has so far said less to attack Obama than he has previously about the FBI, Steve Bannon, LeBron James or pretty much anyone else.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEven the president’s Twitter feed has been relatively quiet, despite rainy days in Washington keeping him off the golf course. He retweeted his social media director Dan Scavino’s post of a video Obama made during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel’s show a few weeks before the 2016 election, sneering that Trump would never be president. He quoted former Rep. Jason Chaffetz on Fox News saying that Obama (initially misspelling the first name as “Barrack”) had never delivered on the economy like this White House. But since then, Trump has wandered off onto other topics.\n\nVice President Mike Pence called it “very disappointing” that Obama broke with the recent presidential tradition of not criticizing successors, and in an interview on Fox News on Sunday he scoffed at “the same tired arguments that he and liberals have made over the last eight years” — though he was presumably referring to the last 10 years, since Obama’s first campaign. “The truth is, the American people in 2016 rejected the policy and direction of Barack Obama when they elected President Donald Trump,” Pence said.\n\nMuch of Obama’s speech, which launched his campaigning for the midterm elections, was a condemnation of attacking American institutions, journalists, the Justice Department and decades of global leadership while refusing to condemn Nazis or dishonesty. Neither Pence nor other leading Republicans disputed that these are hallmarks of Trump’s presidency.\n\n“What President Trump provides for this country every day is strong and decisive leadership in the Oval Office,” Pence said, in another pre-taped appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation. “The truth is, I think President Donald Trump is the most accomplished president of my lifetime and I think already one of the most successful presidents in American history.”\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMany Republicans landed on similar responses — that Obama should remember that he lost and Trump won, that he should think about how he created the backlash that led to that win, and that his own record was full of much of what he was complaining about now.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has struggled since the 2016 GOP primaries to distance himself from Trump while also knocking Democrats, woke up on Saturday after the speech with seven tweets trying to thread the needle of that argument. According to one of them :\n\n“Pres. Obama is right. It is wrong for a President to use divisive language, such as:\n\n1. Call all opponents of same-sex marriage bigots\n\n2. Call the Pro-Life movement a ‘War on Women’\n\n3. Call all immigration enforcement advocates racists\n\n4. Call the GOP the enemy of Hispanics.”\n\nTrump isn’t right, Rubio appeared to be suggesting, but neither was Obama. He quoted the former president’s making fun of Nancy Reagan and defending his heavy use of executive orders instead of legislation, and pointed to Obama’s dismissive attitude toward critics of his policies on immigration and the Iran deal.\n\nA pox on both their houses and everyone else, according to Rubio.\n\n“We should ALL, the Dems, the GOP, the media, admit our role in turning politics into theatre,” Rubio tweeted . “Being outrageous equals clicks, viewers & therefore ratings & $ for media & fame for politicians. Being normal gets you ignored & a primary challenger for being ‘too weak.’” Rubio won his Senate seat in 2010 by running a tea party challenge to Charlie Crist, Florida’s Republican governor at the time.\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Trump ally, made the same argument, not defending the president but condemning Obama along with him.\n\n“I find it richly ironic that he talks about the fact Trump is a symptom, not the cause,” Christie said on ABC’s “This Week,” centering on one of the key lines from Friday’s speech. “If he’s right and Donald Trump is the symptom of a cause, well, Donald Trump got elected in 2016 after eight years of Barack Obama as president. He can’t detach himself.”\n\nChristie said nothing, however, to dispute the broader point that Trump is an avatar of a politics that’s gone wrong.\n\nTrump himself on Friday appeared to be most upset by Obama’s asserting that he should be given the credit for today’s strong economy, since the upturn that Trump is enjoying started years before he was elected.\n\nPence didn’t dispute the numbers. He disputed the perception of the numbers.\n\n“I know he said that, but I don’t think too many Americans noticed it,” Pence told CBS’ Margaret Brennan when asked about the claim.\n\nObama’s focus on Trump’s attacks on journalists provided the most openings for calls of hypocrisy.\n\nHe said that “it shouldn’t be Democratic or Republican to say that we don’t threaten the freedom of the press because they say things or publish stories we don’t like. I complained plenty about Fox News, but you never heard me threaten to shut them down, or call them enemies of the people.”\n\nHe left out, however, that his administration prosecuted reporters as part of leak investigations, and that he himself regularly ducked the press. Even during his stop at a café in Urbana, Illinois, after the speech he looked at one reporter and said, “Hey — I’m not going to answer any questions.” And when another asked whether he was enjoying being back on the trail, he responded with a pat on the arm and shaking his head about engaging.\n\nObama’s approach to the media was the only part of his speech that Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s counselor and reliable bulldozing defender, pushed back on in her appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “You know that President Obama was investigating journalists,” she told Jake Tapper.\n\nThe main theme running through Republican responses to Obama’s return is excitement to have him to run against again, given how much damage Trump’s presidency has done to the GOP’s efforts to hold on to power in the fall.\n\n“Obama demonstrating once again that his chief priority is Obama, not the success of the Democratic Party,” tweeted Ben Shapiro, a conservative radio host and The Daily Wire’s editor-in-chief. “If he cared at all about his party, he’d shut up and go away. Now he’s uniting Republicans against him.”\n\nThat earned agreement from Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush: “If Obama knows what’s good for Republicans, he’ll retake the field and be highly visible this fall.”\n\nAnd, some Republicans argued, that’ll also be good news for Trump himself.\n\n“The more President @BarackObama speaks about the ‘good ole years’ of his presidency, the more likely President @realDonaldTrump is to get re-elected,” tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who used to call Trump crazy and dangerous and now condemns anyone who calls the president as crazy and dangerous. “In fact, the best explanation of President Trump’s victory are the ‘results’ of the Obama Presidency! The Obama years were dominated by higher taxes, slower growth, big government, a broken military, and a pathetically weak foreign policy. The voters found in Hillary Clinton more of the same. They wanted a better way.”", "clickbait": null}

No rooms, no tourists, no business and no money to make.\n\nJust last week, the iconic Hawk’s Cay Resort finally reopened, with its 450 rooms. Most hotels expect to be fully rebuilt and reopened by the end of the year.\n\nHurricane Irma destroyed 25 percent of the homes in the Keys, including 3,000 trailers. Finding new, affordable housing continues to be a major challenge. The St. Columba Episcopal Church in Marathon is helping. It just purchased an old apartment building to rehabilitate to provide small apartments for the working class.\n\n“While it’s beautiful and fun down here, it’s still a world of hurt,” said Debra Andrew Maconaughey, St. Columba’s rector.\n\nAnd the Florida Keys Land Trust is building 750-square-foot cottages on hard hit Big Pine Key.

The list to move into one is long.\n\nMany Irma victims gave up and left the Keys, moving north to rebuild their lives. Many lost everything. But for those that have chosen to stay, despite the annual hurricane threat, their resiliency survived.\n\n“You may not notice the improvements, but Islamorada looks great,” said Leopold. \"They really put the whole town back together.\"\n\nFox News producer Ivonne Amor contributed to this report.

A day after refusing to call on CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta at a news conference in England and bragging about his “takedown,” Trump last July, for instance, tweeted that Acosta was “actually a nice guy.”\n\nFormer Trump aides Gary Cohn Rob Porter are targets of the president’s ire for “leaking” to veteran reporter Bob Woodward. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo\n\nPeople who have interacted with Trump over the years said he can sell two opposing viewpoints because he doesn’t see them as such.\n\nWhen it comes to the Woodward book, in particular, “he has to call it fiction because it criticizes him, that piece is just a given,” said Jack O’Donnell, a former president and chief operating officer of the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City, who has since become a critic of his former boss. “He also loves attacking people. He’s comfortable when he’s doing that. As a tack, he doesn’t associate the two. He can say the book is fiction and then go out and attack individuals he thinks spoke to Woodward.”\n\nO’Donnell said it’s part of a classic Trump playbook. “The same person can be a good guy and a bad guy,” he said. “He does that regularly. He changes every five minutes because it’s all about the attention span, and who is the last person he spoke to, and what light does it put him in in any given moment. That’s what can change his whole approach.”\n\nOther longtime associates said in the case of the Woodward book, Trump would be better off changing tack completely: embracing the narrative whole hog, rather than trying to discredit it on multiple fronts at once.\n\n\"Trump is level-headed. It's the other guy who is taking the stuff off of his desk,” said Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, referring to a scene in the book where Cohn steals a letter off of the Resolute Desk to prevent Trump from withdrawing from a trade agreement with South Korea. \"My strong recommendation is Trump buys 1 million copies and carpet bombs them into every congressional district in dispute and he will win them all.\"\n\nBannon said Trump should stop bashing both the author and his former aides, because in his view the book demonstrates that Trump stayed the course, even beset by a set of advisers misleading him -- and that Trump, alone, understood how national security and trade deals are linked. “If he acts like a 5-year-old,” said Bannon, “I want more 5-year-olds on the National Security Council.”\n\nAnother former adviser said most of Trump’s anger is likely driven by the fact that he never had the opportunity to sit down with Woodward, despite the author’s repeated requests for an interview.\n\nBut even when it comes to whether or not Trump knew about the interview request, he appeared to want to bet on both sides of the coin: he claimed he didn’t know anything about Woodward’s attempts to reach him, while also admitting in the same conversation that “Sen. Graham actually mentioned it quickly in one meeting.\"\n\n“He has always spoken highly of Woodward over the years,” said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser. “He reveres these people. He would have loved to participate in this book. I can tell you, the idea of a Bob Woodward, he lives for that.\"\n\n", "clickbait": null}

I know it's not much, but where can I begin? —Curtis, 37\n\nYou're in luck. There are plenty of places to start investing with as little as $500. Even far less.\n\nNumerous investing apps and robo-advisors will put your money in the stock market starting with just $5. You even have enough money to open a brokerage account with some firms.\n\nBut with all these options, it's hard to know where to start.\n\nFirst, make sure your finances are in good shape before taking on investment risk. Build an emergency fund and keep any money you might need within five years out of the market, said Rachel Rabinovich, a CFP at Society of Grownups.\n\nBut investing in stocks is a good way to grow your money for a longer-term goal because you'll have time to recover from dips in the market.\n\n\"You need to be OK with losing the money you invest, at least in the short-term,\" Rabinovich said.\n\nIf you do feel comfortable putting a some money in the stock market, here's how to decide what investing platform is best for you.\n\nRelated: So, why shouldn't I buy bitcoin?\n\nIf you'd like some investment help\n\nWith some robo-advisor platforms, you can invest a small amount of money in a portfolio that considers some of your preferences, like how much risk you're comfortable taking on. It's usually based on a questionnaire.\n\nA portfolio will give you more diversification than investing in a single stock. Plus, it could include low-cost index funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) that you might not have access to otherwise. Many require minimum initial investments when buying on your own.\n\n\"It's nice to have something set up a portfolio for you. That's what we do as managers, so you're getting that service a little bit on the cheap with a robo-platform,\" said CFP Andrew McFadden, the founder of Panoramic Financial Advice.\n\nSometimes you're charged a fee based on the amount of money in your account. Betterment and Wealthfront, for example, both charge a 0.25% account fee. That amounts to $1.25 a year on $500.\n\nRelated: Are apps a good way to start investing?\n\nStash and Acorns charge a monthly fee of $1 a month, which can be a relatively high percentage for someone investing just $500.\n\nThese two apps offer something a little different. Stash allows you to choose a selection of stocks and ETFs that are focused on different themes, like technology or clean energy. Acorns connects to your credit card and rounds up your purchases to invest the spare change, as well as lets you set up bigger recurring or one-time investments.\n\nBoth Stash and Acorns require just $5 to start investing.\n\nIf you want to do it yourself\n\nThere are a handful of brokerage firms out there that allow you to open an account with $500 or less. They probably won't charge an account fee like a robo-advisor because you'll be picking your investments yourself, but there are usually commission fees ranging between $4 and $7 per trade.\n\nBut while you might be allowed to open an account with just $500, each fund has its own minimum and you might not have enough money to invest in what you want.\n\nIf you have more money to invest, you can get access to even lower-cost index funds and ETF options.\n\nIf you just want to pick a few stocks\n\nInvesting in a few single stocks is more risky than investing in an index fund or ETF, which spread out the risk.\n\nBut it may not be such a bad idea if you're investing a small amount of money. It could be a good learning experience to help you understand what makes the stock price move, McFadden said.\n\nIn that case, he suggests buying three to five stocks in companies that you're interested in.\n\nRelated: Why you might want both a traditional 401(k) and a Roth\n\nOnce your investments grow to about $10,000, it's time to set a new strategy or decide you want a professional — robo or human — to help.\n\nAn app called Robinhood allows you to invest in single stocks without paying any trading fees. There is no account minimum, but you have to have enough money to buy a full share of individual stocks or ETFs. You cannot buy fractional shares.\n\nThe app also allows you to invest in stock options and cryptocurrencies, but Rabinovich doesn't recommend buying those more complicated investments as a beginner.", "clickbait": null}

All the economic indicators, what’s happening overseas, Donald Trump has proven to be far more successful than Barack Obama.”\n\nGrowth since the recession of 2008-09 has been slower than after any other recession since World War II, and the distribution of the growth has been less equal than in the past.

crisis by accusations that he covered up sexual misconduct by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, Francis has refused to respond, his accuser has changed his story and a host of new characters have entered the fray.\n\nCardinals, bishops, priests and ordinary faithful are demanding answers, given that the Vatican knew since at least 2000 about allegations McCarrick had bedded seminarians.\n\nFrancis is coming under increasing pressure to respond to claims by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano that he rehabilitated McCarrick from sanctions Pope Benedict XVI had imposed.\n\nHere is a look at the scandal, which has split the U.S. Catholic hierarchy and further tarnished Francis’ record on abuse.\n\nAlessandro Bianchi / Reuters Pope Francis arrives to lead the Wednesday general audience in Saint Peter's square at the Vatican, August 29, 2018.\n\nWHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL ACCUSATION?\n\nVigano said in his Aug. 26 expose that Benedict imposed “canonical sanctions” on McCarrick in 2009 or 2010 that were similar to what Francis imposed this summer after McCarrick was accused of groping a minor.\n\n“The cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate Mass in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance,” Vigano wrote.\n\nVigano said he told Francis on June 23, 2013, that McCarrick had “corrupted a generation of seminarians and priests” and that Benedict “ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.“\n\nBut he said Francis effectively rehabilitated McCarrick and made him a trusted counselor as he sought to remake the U.S. church leadership to be less focused on the culture wars.\n\nThe public record, however, is rife with evidence that McCarrick lived a life devoid of any sanction from 2009 onwards, traveling widely for the church, attending official functions, including at the Vatican alongside Benedict and Vigano, who as Vatican ambassador in 2012 had the duty of honoring him at an awards ceremony in New York.\n\nStringer . / Reuters Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano speaks at an ordination in Brooklyn, New York, on July 20, 2015\n\nHOW HAS VIGANO’S STORY CHANGED?\n\nFaced with such evidence, Vigano altered his story to say that while Benedict’s measures were in place, McCarrick “didn’t obey” them and Vigano was unable to enforce them.\n\nVigano told LifeSiteNews, an ultraconservative site, that Benedict had made the sanctions “private” probably because McCarrick was retired and Benedict, seeking to avoid scandal, thought he would obey.\n\nEven the conservative National Catholic Register, which originally published Vigano’s revelation, acknowledged that the severity of the measures reported by Vigano is now an open question.\n\nCiting someone close to Benedict, the Register reported that Benedict couldn’t recall how he handled the matter but that there was no formal decree against McCarrick, “just a private request” to keep a low profile.\n\nIf true, that would undercut Vigano’s core accusation that Francis rehabilitated McCarrick from actual canonical sanctions.\n\nHOW HAS THE POPE RESPONDED?\n\nHours after Vigano’s accusations came to light, Francis told an in-flight news conference: “I will not say a word about this .” He challenged journalists to investigate Vigano’s claims and said, “If time passes and you’ve drawn your conclusions, maybe I’ll speak.“\n\nThat said, Francis has referred indirectly to the scandal a few times since. He has said “silence and prayer ” are often the best response to people seeking scandal. He has said it is un-Christian to accuse other people, but necessary to accuse oneself to recognize sin. And he has told newly ordained bishops to work in communion — not as lone actors bent on settling personal scores.\n\nThe Vatican press office has refused all comment, declining to say what, if any, sanctions were ever imposed on McCarrick, and what, if anything, Francis did about them.\n\nWHAT WAS GOING ON IN 2013?\n\nWhen Francis and Vigano met in June 2013, Francis was three months into a new job where he knew he was going to make enemies with the type of conservative culture warriors Vigano championed.\n\nA month after the reported encounter over McCarrick’s sexual past, Francis would go on to win praise from the liberal Catholic world for saying of another purportedly gay priest he had named a close adviser: “Who am I to judge?“\n\nThat suggests that Francis, at least in 2013, didn’t consider the past sex lives or homosexual orientation of his counselors to be a firing offense — or recognize that those relationships could constitute an abuse of power.\n\nBut Francis did recognize something was amiss when he sent the Vatican’s top sex abuse expert to investigate Scottish Cardinal Keith O’Brien, who recused himself from the conclave that elected Francis pope because of allegations he slept with seminarians.\n\nO’Brien was a conservative hard-liner on homosexuality whose sexual peccadilloes were aired publicly, which could explain the disparity in treatment.\n\nMorteza Nikoubazl / Reuters Ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was removed from ministry after he was credibly accused of sexually abusing a teenager 47 years ago. McCarrick has also been accused of sleeping with seminarians.\n\nHOW HAS THIS BEEN RECEIVED IN THE US?\n\nMore than a week before Vigano’s disclosure, the head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, announced he wanted an audience with Francis to present his request for a full-fledged Vatican investigation into the McCarrick affair.\n\nAt the time, DiNardo’s call was seen as a power play by the U.S. bishops, who were under fire for having covered for McCarrick for decades, to shift the blame to the Vatican. McCarrick was made archbishop of Washington and cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II, despite knowledge in the Vatican that he slept with seminarians.\n\nDiNardo followed up his request for a Vatican investigation with a statement saying Vigano’s accusations deserve answers. More than a dozen U.S. bishops have echoed the call, though others, including a top Francis appointee, Cardinal Blase Cupich, have demurred. Cupich has said Francis shouldn’t go down the “rabbit hole” by responding.\n\nNo date for a DiNardo audience has been set. But he is due in Rome on Sep. 27 to preside over a deacon ordination ceremony for seminarians from the North American College, the U.S seminary just up the hill from the Vatican.\n\nMeanwhile, Francis has met with embattled Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who is facing calls to step down over both the McCarrick scandal and for mishandling some abuse cases when he was bishop in Pittsburgh. Those cases were exposed in a recent Pennsylvania grand jury report.\n\nIn another blow to Wuerl’s ability to lead, one of his own deacons said in a letter published Sunday that he could in good conscience no longer assist him at Mass, and called for him to step down.\n\nWuerl actually offered to resign two years ago when he turned 75, so the decision on when he leaves rests with Francis alone.\n\nWHO IS NOW SPEAKING OUT?\n\nAmid the official silence from the Vatican, some new players have emerged to try to discredit Vigano’s version of events and defend Francis.\n\nOne of them is a familiar face, the Rev. Federico Lombardi , the Jesuit who served as Vatican spokesman for Benedict and Francis until 2016. Last weekend, amid a communications crisis for the Vatican, it was announced that Lombardi would rejoin the Jesuit magazine La Civilta Cattolica, which serves as an unofficial mouthpiece for the papacy.\n\nAlso last weekend, Lombardi and his English-speaking assistant, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, issued a joint statement contesting Vigano’s version of events about the controversial meeting that Vignao orchestrated between the pope and U.S. anti-gay marriage campaigner Kim Davis during Francis’ 2015 visit to the U.S.\n\nThe encounter made headlines because it was viewed as a papal endorsement of Davis’ highly politicized campaign — something Francis had been keen to avoid.", "clickbait": null}

Fifteen years ago, Alvarado emigrated from San Luis Potosi in central Mexico, and has worked in the fields of California’s Central Valley ever since, picking food—broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, potatoes—and religiously listening to La Campesina, not for the prizes or the Mexican music, but because of the singular role it plays in the life of the farmworker community.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStop by any group of farmworkers here, and you’re likely to hear La Campesina. That’s as intended—the network was founded in 1983 by Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers with the goal of reaching farmworkers in the fields, and it is operated today by the Cesar Chavez Foundation. But where Chavez originally dreamed of programming that would serve the needs of Spanish-speaking immigrants by educating them about workers’ rights, today’s political climate demands something different to serve the immigrant audience. Though it’s happened largely out of the view of the mainstream news media, throughout Western states, La Campesina has adapted to the political moment by becoming something like the immigrant community’s version of Radio Free Europe—a voice of idealistic defiance broadcasting in hostile territory—at a time of deep partisan animus toward Latinos. Now, with nine stations across four states—from Yuma, Arizona, in the south to the tri-cities of Washington in the north, broadcasting in both AM and FM—it reaches more than 1 million regular listeners, many of them immigrants working in hotels, restaurants, and manufacturing or food-processing plants.\n\nWhile AM radio is often thought to be the turf of conservative talking heads, La Campesina’s KNAI is frequently the top-rated AM station in metropolitan Phoenix. In April, it had double the ratings of KFYI, the local station that carries Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck, competing against those broadcasting titans with regional Mexican music, resistance-themed commentary en Español, and practical life tips for getting by as a Latino immigrant in Trump’s America.\n\nAmong Campesina’s most popular regular segments: advice on what to do if approached by an agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For Alvarado, the radio contest winner, the prospect of being detained by ICE looms as her biggest fear. “We need to be on the lookout for la migra because they are going strong right now and they want us out of this country,” she says. It’s one of the main reasons she listens religiously to La Campesina: She and her colleagues carry a portable radio with them in the fields because they see the station as a lifeline.\n\nThat’s a role the radio network plays on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican listeners in San Luis Rio Colorado and Mexicali tune in to Yuma’s KCEC for its immigration-related programming. Other listeners as far south as Mexico City, Guatemala and El Salvador stream La Campesina’s programming online. All can hear tips on how to best avoid ICE and the resources available to them if they are detained.\n\n“We are a beacon of hope for immigrants and people who are coming to the country who do not necessarily have their footings here or don't necessarily know where to go for help,” says Cesar L. Chavez, grandson and namesake of the civil-rights leader and the general manager of La Campesina’s Bakersfield station for the past six years. “We try to guide them in the right direction.”\n\n“There is no wall for us,” says Maria Barquin, a longtime La Campesina employee who now directs programming for the entire network. “The signal crosses the wall.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe genesis of La Campesina came in 1962, when Cesar Chavez, along with leadership of what would become the United Farm Workers of America founded the National Farm Workers Association and adopted a resolution calling for the creation of a once a week, 30-minute Spanish language radio program to entertain and educate farmworkers. From that seed grew the vision for Radio Campesina, which formed in 1983 not as a single show, but an entire station—Visalia’s KUFW.\n\nToday, La Campesina’s programming consists of popular regional Mexican music hosted by colorful deejays, public service announcements and educational programming. Their daily network educational program, “Punto de Vista” (“Point of View”), covers topics related to immigration, health and education, with experts invited on to speak about those topics.\n\nWhen immigration raids expanded in California earlier this year, La Campesina adopted a new slogan to fits its more aggressive posture in opposing the crackdown—“La estación siempre en guardia,” or “the station always on guard.”\n\nHosts receive on-air phone calls from farmworkers who’ve encountered ICE and are willing to share their stories. Attorneys and psychologists offer educational commentaries, advising the immigrant community how to cope with the anxiety of family separation. In between, the station broadcasts an announcement from their current campaign: “Since the beginning of [the Trump] administration, the community has had to adapt to a new way of living. Millions of Latinos live in fear of seeing their families separated by an ICE detention. That is why at Radio Campesina, we are a station that is on guard against these actions. Here, we will tell you how to prepare your family with information that can help you in the case of a raid. Not having a status in this country does not make you a criminal. Get ready and act.”\n\n“We are protecting our community and informing them of their rights by giving them information about what to do if they get detained or if a friend gets detained,” says Barquin. This advice includes how to get representation by an attorney and how to secure their families and properties if they are deported.\n\nIn April, Radio Campesina’s team traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, to meet the migrant caravan that had traveled from Central America (and earned the ire of President Trump in the process), and broadcast a live show from across the border, hoping to create a bridge between immigrants wanting to enter the U.S and immigrants who are already there. Besides bringing together both sides of the border through their airwaves, La Campesina hoped to create awareness with all people, even those who are not part of the immigrant community.\n\nLa Campesina also traveled to the border in response to Trump’s family-separation policy. It broadcast live reports after every update on the issue. The crisis prompted the network to relaunch its annual “En guardia con mi voto” or “Get out to vote” campaign, with a more aggressive posture than ever before.\n\nThis summer, Campesina has expanded its efforts to reach a new audience: the sons and daughters of immigrants, people who see themselves as having a sort of dual identity. In Fresno, KBHH “Forge” has become the network’s first bilingual station (it already has an English-language station in Bakersfield; Forge is aimed at listeners who can speak both languages). “Forge” will follow the same strategy as its Campesina brethren but will play Top 40 music with a twist of Spanish-language songs.\n\n“The kids of those listeners of Radio Campesina are growing up,” says Barquin. “This generation needs to have empowerment maybe in a different language. We understand that they have the same roots as their parents in the culture that they love, but we also understand that the language and the music is something that is evolving as they come to a different country.”\n\nIt’s a country that, according to Alvarado, gives opportunities to immigrants that their homelands could not. “We came here to work, not to commit crime. We came here to progress,” says Alvarado. “We are not stealing, and they are not giving us anything for free. We are working for it.”\n\nOn the day Alvarado won lunch, local disc jockey Marimar Flores stopped by to help deliver it, and congratulated her on winning the contest. Alvarado’s fellow farmworkers let out a celebratory cheer and lined up for helpings of pork in green chile, salad, rice and beans. While they ate, a representative from a local health care provider taught them how to make a medical appointment. Throughout, it had the feeling of a celebration.\n\nWhen the food was gone and their plates cleared, the farmworkers waved goodbye to the radio station’s van as it drove away, kicking up dust in its wake. They retied their bandanas over their faces and returned to the fields, where the tinny sound of La Campesina would waft alongside them until they stopped working.\n\nAlondra De La Cruz, a White House Correspondents Associations Scholar, is a multimedia reporter from the Central Valley in California pursuing a master’s in journalism from UC Berkeley.

That’s Nuts. Let’s make one thing absolutely clear: The polygraph is not a lie-detector test.\n\nSince Wednesday afternoon, when the New York Times published an incendiary op-ed by an anonymous senior Trump administration official—one in which the author admits to “working diligently from within to frustrate parts of [the president’s] agenda and his worst inclinations”—the White House has been in a panicked hunt for its author.\n\nThe op-ed could scarcely have come at a worse time for the White House, where hackles were already raised over the contents of Bob Woodward’s newest book, Fear, which paints a portrait of an unstable president out of his intellectual depth and surrounded to some degree by aides who have to work day and night to prevent him from engaging in reckless and destructive behavior.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn order to track down the members of what the Times op-ed termed the “steady state”—that is, senior aides who keep in check a president they view as erratic but whom they are enabling in order to achieve their own policy objectives—Senator Rand Paul recently raised the prospect of subjecting everyone in the White House who holds a security clearance to a polygraph examination in order to root out leakers—even those who share unclassified information.\n\nWe have a combined 30-plus years of experience handling issues surrounding the polygraph, including past congressional testimony on the topic. Relying upon that experience, we can say with considerable confidence that Sen. Paul’s proposal is ridiculous, completely counterproductive and sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nLet’s make one thing absolutely clear: The polygraph is not a lie-detector test. It does not determine if you are telling the truth. The examiner reviewing the readings from the polygraph cannot determine if you are telling the truth. No matter how much Hollywood might try to convince you otherwise, the polygraph is not a mechanized version of truth serum.\n\nThe polygraph is merely a device that evaluates various physiological reactions your body makes when answering questions. It measures your heart rate, respiration and perspiration, among other things. Examiners are trained how to “read between the lines” in terms of what those measurements may suggest about the truthfulness of your answers. If their interpretation of the readings suggests deception, the examiners are further trained in how to coax individuals into subsequently divulging more information in order to “put their mind at ease” so that their reactions will be lessened. Polygraph examiners are skillful and trained interrogators, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nAs part of our law practice, we represent contractors and federal employees working across the intelligence and law enforcement communities who have run into problems with the polygraph. We routinely have to address the fallout of alleged “admissions” made by our clients during polygraph sessions and which are subsequently used as the basis for personnel or security clearance proceedings.\n\nThere are two primary circumstances in which the federal government commonly uses polygraph examinations: one is for the security clearance-screening of individuals being considered for access to classified information (most agencies using polygraphs deal with Sensitive Compartmented Information, some of the government’s most sensitive secrets); and the other is in a more narrow situation where specific allegations of misconduct have been levied against an existing employee or contractor. In both situations, the polygraph is often just one of several investigative tools used to gather relevant and material information.\n\nIt is virtually unheard of to do what Sen. Paul is suggesting: submitting entire offices, departments or agencies to a categorical polygraph screening merely to root out a “mole,” and it would undoubtedly be counterproductive.\n\nMoreover, there is no reason to believe that it would even work as intended. History is littered with actual moles and spies working for years within the U.S. government despitebeing subjected to polygraph examinations. Aldrich Ames and Ana Belen Montes, convicted spies who committed espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union and Cuba, respectively, were able to “pass” polygraph examinations on multiple occasions during their careers in the government. The Department of Justice has itself argued before the Supreme Court that polygraph evidence should be inadmissible in court due to its inaccuracy. Government polygraph experts also acknowledge the existence of false positives (innocent people suggesting guilt) and false negatives (guilty people displaying innocence), calling into question any obtained results.\n\nIt is certainly possible that such a broad polygraph screening would find some leakers. People inevitably crack under pressure, and it is plausible that some subjects would admit to leaking information. But there is no particular scientific basis or reason to believe that it would be the actual leakers the screening was designed to find.\n\nIn the meantime, the entire charade would severely disrupt White House operations and morale, especially if certain senior individuals— such as Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Kellyanne Conway and John Kelly, to name a few—were exempted from the screening (or any punishment for admissions they might make during it).\n\nThe president routinely denounces the ongoing Russia probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as a “witch hunt.” But a broad polygraph screening of the White House would truly be a “witch hunt.” Yes, it might find some peripheral “witches,” but would be unlikely to locate the true perpetrators, and in the meantime, it will have been an incredible misuse of resources.\n\nHumanity has always found the idea of a tool that compels people to be honest compelling. It’s no coincidence that Wonder Woman, who wields a “lasso of truth,” was created by William Moulton Marston, a man who invented an early prototype of the polygraph. But treating the latter like it’s the former is pure fantasy.\n\nBradley P. Moss is a partner at the Washington, D.C. Law Office of Mark S.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) literally shoots a document representing the Republican-led lawsuit that could end a key and very popular Affordable Care Act provision.\n\nThe 30-second spot starts with Manchin mentioning an ad that helped catapult him to the Senate in 2010, in which he took “dead aim” at a complicated cap-and-trade environmental bill that had passed in the House. Manchin, rated by analysts as among the most vulnerable senators on the ballot this year, in the new ad takes aim against the effort to invalidate Obamacare’s insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions medical conditions.\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey, Manchin’s GOP challenger in November’s election, is among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that would allow insurance companies to deny coverage to people with various pre-existing conditions.\n\n“He is just dead wrong and that ain’t going to happen,” Manchin says in his ad.\n\nPatrick Morrisey's lawsuit would take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions. That's just dead wrong, and that ain't gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/QFTSZGnmdK — Joe Manchin (@JoeManchinWV) September 10, 2018\n\nIn a state where polls show approval of President Donald Trump is among the highest in the country, Manchin is making health care the central focus of his re-election bid. And it’s not hard to see why: West Virginia has the highest share of adults with pre-existing conditions of any state.\n\nThe Obamacare protections are “the difference between life and death for the 800,000 West Virginians with a pre-existing condition. I will continue doing everything in my power to protect their access to affordable health care,” Manchin said at a health care forum in Huntington, West Virginia,\n\nLast week, attorneys representing 20 Republican state officials walked into a Texas courtroom and ask a federal judge to invalidate all or parts of Obamacare. District Judge Reed O’Connor appeared sympathetic to their case in oral arguments, but he did not immediately rule on the lawsuit’s motion for an injunction against the law. If it succeeds, experts say it will unleash chaos on the health insurance markets and, eventually, leave an estimated 17 million Americans without coverage.\n\nManchin is a former West Virginia governor whose folksy style and centrist voting record has sustained his career in his state. Indeed, his campaign’s focus on the pre-existing conditions issue stands in sharp contrast to the careful way he has approached Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring last week’s confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, several of Manchin’s fellow Senate Democrats argued that Kavanaugh’s past writings as an appellate court judge indicate he would take an ax to Obamacare if given the chance as a Supreme Court justice. But Kavanaugh has also faced criticism from some conservatives who say he is insufficiently opposed to the law.\n\nManchin has not yet said how he will vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination. He supported Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and Republicans are looking to win him over once more.", "clickbait": null}

Ted Cruz’s lead slipping, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick showed up in Washington on July 25 to deliver an urgent plea to White House officials: Send President Donald Trump.\n\nPatrick, who chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state, made the case that a Trump visit was needed to boost turnout for Cruz and the rest of the Texas Republican ticket. The lieutenant governor soon got his wish: Trump announced on Twitter late last month that he was planning a blowout October rally for Cruz, his former GOP rival.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe previously unreported meeting comes as senior Republicans grow increasingly concerned about the senator’s prospects in the reliably red state, with some expressing fear that an underperformance could threaten GOP candidates running further down the ballot. Cruz’s Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, has raised barrels of cash, closed the polling gap and emerged as a cause célèbre of liberals nationwide.\n\nTrump’s rally is just the most public display of a Republican cavalry rushing to the senator’s aid. Cruz remains a favorite to win another term, and some senior GOP figures insist the concern is overblown. Yet the party — which has had a fraught relationship with the anti-establishment Texas senator over the years — is suddenly leaving little to chance. Behind the scenes, the White House, party leaders and a collection of conservative outside groups have begun plotting out a full-fledged effort to bolster Cruz.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, who’s planning an October fundraiser for Cruz at Washington’s Capital Grille restaurant, said he had a simple directive to GOP givers.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n“We’re not bluffing, this is real, and it is a serious threat,” Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said in an interview. “If Ted does his job and we do ours, I think we’ll be fine. But if we have donors sitting on the sidelines thinking that, ‘Well, this isn’t all that serious,’ or ‘I don’t need to be concerned,’ then that’s a problem.”\n\nThe push reflects a broader anxiety within the party about the electoral environment this fall. It also has practical implications for the GOP: The resources devoted to Cruz include money that could otherwise be used to oust vulnerable incumbent Democrats in red states like North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nWith O’Rourke outraising Cruz more than 2 to 1 during the past quarter, right-leaning organizations have begun routing resources to the state. The anti-tax Club for Growth, which spent millions on Cruz during his 2012 Senate bid, has started a seven-figure advertising blitz aimed at tearing down the Democratic congressman. The organization has begun polling the race, and David McIntosh, the organization’s president, recently traveled to Texas to meet with donors who could help fund the barrage. More than $1 million has been raised so far, people close to the group say.\n\nA handful of other well-funded groups are considering joining the effort, including the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, the Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund, the newly formed Senate Reform Fund, and Ending Spending, which in the past has been bankrolled by major GOP financiers including New York City investor Paul Singer. Some of the groups have been in touch with one another as they weigh their next moves and try to determine how much their help is needed.\n\n“I think there will be a lot of money,” said Doug Deason, a Dallas investor and prominent GOP giver who met with McIntosh.\n\nCruz, who aggressively wooed evangelicals during his 2016 presidential campaign, is taking steps to stir interest among conservative groups. He recently attended a Beltway meeting of the Conservative Action Project, a secretive gathering of movement leaders, where he issued a call to arms to prevent a Democratic coup in his state.\n\nThey are responding in kind. On Thursday, the Senate Conservatives Fund sent an email to supporters asking them to finance Cruz. The Family Research Council is planning a multistop October bus tour through Texas. And this week, Tea Party Patriots is expected to start a phone, text and mail campaign bolstering the senator.\n\n“Texas is one of our top priority states,” said Jenny Beth Martin, the Tea Party Patriots co-founder. “We want to help Ted Cruz be reelected to the Senate because he’s championed our priorities on Capitol Hill.”\n\nThe senator, meanwhile, is relying on the big donor network that fueled his presidential bid. He’s been reaching out to major givers via text message and has recently been in touch with Bekah Mercer, the reclusive conservative megadonor whose father was a primary financier of Cruz’s presidential bid.\n\nLee Roy Mitchell, a founder of the Cinemark movie theater chain, is among those concerned that major donors aren't taking the senator's reelection race seriously enough.\n\n“We’re solidly behind the senator, and I would like to think most Texans are. I believe they are,” said the Dallas-based Mitchell, an active member of the Koch political network who, with his wife, Tandy, has donated a combined $1 million to a pro-Cruz super PAC. “But there’s a tremendous amount of [Democratic] money being poured in here to change people’s opinions.”\n\nAfter antagonizing the K Street set early in his Senate career, Cruz is courting it as he attempts to fill his coffers. Cruz has been regularly inviting high-powered lobbyists to dinners at Capital Grille and other Washington restaurants.\n\nHe’s been candid during the sit-downs about the threat he’s facing for reelection, those who’ve met with him say.\n\nCruz has filled his calendar with fundraisers, including at least three scheduled this week. And he’s turned to veteran Washington players like Wayne Berman, who’s hosted several fundraising events for the Texas senator. Berman, who sits on the board of the influential Republican Jewish Coalition, has also reached out to would-be givers from the pro-Israel and financial industries.\n\n“Cruz has made a concerted effort over the last year and a half to listen and work with many of us around town,” said U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief political strategist Scott Reed, who attended a Cruz fundraiser last week.\n\nCruz is also turning to an old foe: Trump.\n\nThe senator and the president have gotten over their nasty 2016 rivalry, when Cruz called Trump a “sniveling coward” and pointedly refused to endorse him on stage at the Republican National Convention; Trump dubbed Cruz “Lyin’ Ted” and linked Cruz’s father to JFK’s assassination.\n\nNow, Cruz is leaning on the president to turn out voters with the planned October rally. The president’s son Donald Trump Jr. is expected to host multiple events for the senator in the Houston area on Oct. 3.\n\nTrump, aides say, was eager to help. The president personally drafted the tweet in which he announced the rally, which he wrote would be held in “the biggest stadium in Texas we can find.”\n\nSince the 2016 race, Trump has repeatedly told Cruz that he’d like to help him get reelected. Final plans for the event, party officials say, are still being worked out.\n\nAdministration officials are among those who’ve privately expressed concern about the senator’s prospects. Those worries burst out into the open over the weekend, when Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told donors at a Republican National Committee meeting that Cruz could lose, a person familiar with the remarks confirmed. The closed-door remarks were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe sight of national Republicans coming to Cruz's defense would have been almost unthinkable a few years ago. After being elected in 2012, Cruz clashed repeatedly with GOP leadership — he once took to the Senate floor to call McConnell, the majority leader, a liar. But senior Republicans are putting all that behind them.\n\nCornyn, who expects to hit the trail for Cruz in October, lavished praise on his Texas colleague, saying that since the 2016 election he’d become a “team player” who worked collaboratively with fellow senators. In 2014, Cruz snubbed Cornyn, refusing to endorse the state’s senior senator in his primary election.\n\n“We’re all adults, and I’d like to think that we’re professionals,” Cornyn said in the interview last week. “We understand what’s at stake.”\n\n", "clickbait": null}

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nPapadopoulos said on Sunday that he believed he did not incriminate Trump in his 2017 talks with law enforcement.\n\n“I didn’t understand really the nature of what was going on,” he said. “Of course I’m remorseful, I’m contrite, and I did lie, but, you know, you’re just taken off guard, I guess, in a such a momentous situation where you’re potentially sitting there, incriminating the president, even though of course I don’t think I did.”\n\nHe added: “You know, that was probably in the back of my mind, of what exactly am I doing here talking about Russian hacking or election interference with the candidate that I just worked for.”\n\nThe former foreign policy adviser pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his meetings in London with a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud — making Papadopoulos the first person to admit guilt to Robert Mueller in the special counsel’s sprawling Russia inquiry.\n\n“He basically presented himself as this well-connected, well-traveled former diplomat who could essentially connect me and the campaign to Russian officials and to other leaders around the world,” Papadopoulos said of Mifsud.\n\nMifsud told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 that he had obtained “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, and would claim to have amassed troves of emails connected to Clinton’s campaign, according to Mueller’s prosecutors.\n\n“He sat me down and he was quite giddy,” Papadopoulos said. “And he told me, ‘I have information that the Russians have thousands of Hillary Clinton’s emails.’”\n\nA month before that meeting, the emails of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were stolen in a data breach. Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in relation to the crime in July, as well as on charges of cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other liberal targets.\n\nPapadopoulos maintained that he was not made aware of the hacks on Podesta or the DNC, and has testified that he did not tell any Trump campaign officials about his conversation with Mifsud regarding Clinton’s emails.\n\nPapadopoulos said he chose to keep the professor’s claim under wraps because Paul Manafort — shortly after becoming the Trump campaign chairman in May 2016 — quashed the idea of a potential summit between then-candidate Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, which Papadopoulos had been trying to broker.\n\n“As far as I remember, it didn’t seem that Paul Manafort wanted to pursue this meeting,” Papadopoulos said on Sunday. “So as far as I remember, why on Earth would I then, after I was shut down in a, I guess in a formal way, after a lot of vacillating between the campaign, would I then tell the campaign something like that?”\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday it was unlikely that Papadopoulos did not tell other members of the Trump campaign about his talks with Mifsud.\n\n“One thing is fairly clear: This is an ambitious guy who wants to be a player in the Trump campaign,” Warner said of Papadopoulos on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n“Trump had chosen him as part of his foreign policy team,” Warner said. “It just stretches, I think, most people’s credibility that, if Papadopoulos had this knowledge and he wanted to try to further ingratiate himself with the campaign, that he wouldn’t have shared that with somebody on the campaign.”\n\nPapadopoulos also said he had “no opinion on” and “no knowledge of” Trump’s alleged attempts to obstruct Mueller’s investigation, and could not answer whether the special counsel would be able to demonstrate coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\n\n“I have no idea,” he said on Sunday. “All I can say is that my testimony might have helped move something towards that, but I have no idea.”", "clickbait": null}

But there are right ways and wrong ways to do that. The budget change passed in February was the wrong way, removing incentives experts agree are necessary to drive Part D’s successful market-based structure, and potentially jeopardizing the program for the future. One right way is for Congress to address the looming Part D Cliff. In 2020, the donut hole will increase by more than $1,200, raising out-of-pocket costs for the most vulnerable seniors with significant health care needs. Congress should act now on both of these issues to protect seniors from a sudden spike in out-of-pocket costs in Part D, while securing and strengthening the program for the long-term.

USA TODAY\n\nOnce in place, the Ocean Cleanup, dubbed System 001, is deployed. The passive system’s floating series of connected booms naturally form into a broad U-shape. Below the booms, a 9-foot skirt gently corrals the plastic trash that contaminates our seas.\n\nMore: 6 things you can do to stop plastic pollution today\n\nMore: Where did the trash in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch come from? How do we stop it?\n\nMore: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch\n\nCurrents and waves push trash into the machine's center to collect it. Floating particles are captured by the net while the push of water against the net propels fish and other marine life under and beyond.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup System 001 floating in the lagoon in front of the assembly yard in Alameda, Calif. (Photo: Ocean Cleanup)\n\nA garbage ship then is sent out to scoop up the collected trash and transport it to shore for recycling.\n\nThe system is fitted with solar-powered lights and anti-collision systems to keep any stray ships from running into it, along with cameras, sensors and satellites that allow it to communicate with its creators.\n\nOcean microplastics have lasting effects on the ocean: Fish and other marine life mistake the pieces for food and consume them, potentially cutting their digestive tracts, or filling their stomachs so there’s no room for real food, allowing chemicals and contamination to enter the organism and harm it. It can take weeks for the plastic pieces sink to the ocean floor as they become heavier after being eaten and excreted by fish and other animals or becoming covered with bacteria and other organisms. At the ocean floor they can harm deep-sea organisms then eventually covered in silt and entombed on the sea bed.\n\nA multi-year project\n\nThe project is due to the efforts of Boyan Slat, who as a teenager was so disgusted by the plastic waste he encountered diving off Greece that he has devoted his life to cleaning up the mess.\n\nThe non-profit he helped found has garnered support from the Dutch government, individuals and many in the tech world, including Marc Benioff of Salesforce. Last year, it received $5.9 million in donations and reported reserves from donations in previous years of $17 million.\n\nThe system is being built in San Francisco so it can tackle the largest of the world's five trash gyres, the infamous Great Pacific Garbage Patch. These patches consist of huge concentrations of garbage, mostly made up of buoyant plastics.\n\nDue to the gyres (which act like slow-moving whirlpools), the floating trash gathers in areas hundreds of miles across.\n\nOn Saturday, the Maersk Launcher ship took a cleanup machine out to sea, accompanied by seven staff from the Ocean Cleanup, 18 crewmembers from the Danish shipping company Maersk and five independent marine observers.\n\nA press boat followed full of a polyglot collection of reporters and television crews whose presence signals the intense interest the public has shown globally to this audacious plan to clean plastic pollution from the world's oceans.\n\nOccasionally, a small motorboat cruised by the press boat, full of what appeared to be fans of the project shouting \"Hey, Boyan!\" and \"Go, Ocean Cleanup.\" Then the media coordinator explained that it was Boyan's mother, aunt and other family members who'd come over from Holland to witness the launch.\n\nIt will take about five days for the system to reach the testing area, where it will be deployed for about two weeks.\n\nThe path the Ocean Cleanup will take out of San Francisco Bay and into the Pacific ocean Saturday, Sept. 8, 2018 as it launches a test of its plastic pollution cleaning system. (Photo: Ocean Cleanup)\n\nIf all goes well, it will be towed out to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch nearly 1,400 miles off the West Coast, about halfway between California and Hawaii. A support vessel will fish out the collected plastic every few weeks, according to the Associated Press. The waste will then be transported to dry land for recycling.\n\nShipping containers filled with the collected plastic are expected back on land within a year.\n\nThe project is lauded by many as a positive attempt to deal with the growing problem of plastic pollution in the oceans.\n\n\"This is just the beginning of the beginning,\" Slat told USA TODAY. \"It will be a relief to be at this moment, it's the culmination of 5 years of work. But we have a long way to go and lots more testing before the real thing – when we first take plastic out the water.\n\nHowever, many in the marine biology and oceanographic world worry that it could keep the public from focusing on the real problem – stopping the seemingly endless flow of trash into the oceans in the first place.\n\nWhile Rolf Halden, a professor of environmental health engineering at Arizona State University, applauds the effort, he says cleaning while trash pours in doesn't make much sense.\n\n\"If you allow the doors to be open during a sandstorm while you’re vacuuming,\" he said, \"you won’t get very far.”\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2wQOlLa", "clickbait": null}

Ron DeSantis, one of Donald Trump’s staunchest congressional allies, announced Monday that he is resigning his seat to focus on his campaign for Florida governor, a race that was fueled by Trump and has quickly become one of the most-watched gubernatorial battles of 2018.\n\nThe three-term congressman said the move was needed because it’s “inappropriate” for him to continue to draw his $174,000-per-year salary while he's on the campaign trail and missing official congressional business. It’s a message in line with the fiscally conservative persona DeSantis has cultivated in Congress and on the campaign trail.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“As the Republican nominee for governor of Florida, it is clear to me that I will likely miss the vast majority of our remaining session days for this Congress,” DeSantis wrote in his resignation letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan. “Under these circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to accept a salary.”\n\nThe resignation was effective September 1.\n\nDeSantis, a Navy veteran and JAG officer, was focused largely on his primary fight against Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam for the last few months; for the first several months of his primary campaign DeSantis missed less than 10 percent of congressional votes, but that number spiked to 53 percent between July and September, according to GovTrack.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

The federal government, for instance, is set to run out of money in September, which will again set up a contentious vote over keeping the lights on or forcing another government shutdown.\n\nTrump, who has called DeSantis a “warrior,” has already expressed indifference to the notion of a shutdown, indicating he is willing to force a shutdown if he does not get support for his proposed border wall along the southern border.\n\n“If it happens, it happens,” Trump said last week. “If it’s about border security, I’m willing to do anything.”\n\nIn the primary election, DeSantis’ most frequent talking point was about his endorsement from Trump, who both tweeted his support and held a rally for DeSantis in Tampa. DeSantis’ campaign got national attention for a TV ad featuring his toddler building a wall with cardboard blocks, a signal of how closely DeSantis wanted to tether himself to the president.\n\n“Build the wall,” DeSantis says to his daughter in the ad.\n\nThough Florida primary voters remain very supportive of Trump, that close relationship will be viewed differently in a general election, and DeSantis tying himself to a Trump-driven government shutdown would almost assuredly be used against him on the campaign trail.\n\nDemocrats still seized on the resignation, using it as a chance to re-up the talking points they will use to characterize DeSantis as too conservative for Florida’s general election electorate.\n\n“Ron DeSantis’ entire political career has been about helping one person: Ron DeSantis,” Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo said in a statement. “In Washington Ron DeSantis voted to take away health care coverage from millions of people while he showered President Trump with praise on Fox News.”\n\nDeSantis formally shut down his campaign account in July after spending the fund down to $15 cash on hand. Most of his excess funds were transferred to the Republican Party of Florida, which will be heavily involved in his gubernatorial bid.\n\nDeSantis’ 6th Congressional District includes a coastal slice of Northeast Florida just south of Jacksonville. The race to replace him includes former Clinton administration staffer Nancy Soderberg versus Republican Michael Waltz, a businessman and former Green Beret.\n\nIt’s unlikely a special election will be called, meaning the seat will remain vacant until January.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Rizzo's name.", "clickbait": null}

On the next ridge, a row of chimneys marked where houses had stood before the fire.\n\nAs an adult, Sand created Grabbit the rabbit, a cartoon mascot for emergency preparedness. She marketed Grabbit-themed products, such as a kids’ backpack stuffed with necessities for a quick escape.\n\nBut last December, when a predawn wildfire came roaring toward the same home where she grew up, Sand was taken by surprise. She learned of the fire only when a friend saw it from the freeway and called to warn her.\n\nStorm Tracker: Florence's projected path\n\nSand grabbed her laptop, purse, phone and some papers, and hopped into her car.

She left the pool uncovered and found it, when she was able to return three days later, filled with ashes.\n\nGrabbit would not be impressed.\n\nOne of several homes destroyed by a wildfire on Lauren Sand's street in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles last December. The predawn blaze raced up a hillside before most residents realized they were in danger. No one was killed, but few were prepared. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)\n\nA land of natural hazards\n\nAmerica is riddled with fault lines and bordered by storm-tossed oceans, with two great north-south mountain ranges but none running east-west to keep Arctic air from flowing south and tropical air from going north.\n\nThere are hurricanes in the Southeast and nor'easters in the Northeast; tornadoes on the lower Plains and blizzards on the upper Plains; earthquakes and volcanoes along the Pacific Coast, which also is vulnerable to tsunamis; sinkholes and lightning in Florida; avalanches in the Rockies and flash floods in the Appalachians; hail from Minnesota to Texas and ice storms from Wyoming to Maine; lake-effect snow from the Great Lakes and the Great Salt Lake; and monsoons in Arizona.\n\nIn the first half of this year, six natural disasters each caused at least $1 billion damage and killed a total of 36 people. This came after 2017, the costliest year on record. It included California’s Wine Country fires, which killed 44 and destroyed 10,000 homes; Washington State blazes that dumped ash on Seattle like snow and pushed the air quality index in Spokane to “hazardous;’’ and three hurricanes – Harvey, Irma and Maria – so bad their names were retired.\n\nCLOSE An explosive wildfire closed down dozens of miles of a major California freeway. The Delta Fire erupted Wednesday afternoon and within hours devoured nearly 8 square miles on both sides of Interstate 5 near the Oregon state line. (Sept. 6) AP\n\nGlobal warming makes wildfires hotter and probably will make hurricanes bigger. And the number of people living in harm’s way, including active earthquake and volcano zones, is increasing.\n\nYet, as Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long observed this year, America lacks a \"culture of preparedness.’’\n\nWe mostly don’t stock up on batteries, candles and water; we don’t prepare a family emergency plan or buy a hand-cranked radio; we don’t listen carefully to warnings and often don’t understand them when we do.\n\nOr obey them. A survey in Florida after Hurricane Irma by Mason-Dixon polling found that only 43 percent of those under mandatory evacuation orders actually evacuated.\n\nPlumes rise where lava pours into the sea from Kilauea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii last month. The eruption has destroyed more than 700 homes. It's just one of many natural disasters grabbing Americans' attention this summer. (Photo: USGS via AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA 2015 study by the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University found that two-thirds of Americans said they were not prepared to evacuate in an emergency. But Irwin Redlener, the center’s director, believes the situation is actually worse.\n\nSometimes, when he’s speaking to groups of emergency preparedness specialists, he’ll ask how many have a personal or family evacuation plan. Only a few hands go up, and most of their plans turn out to be half-baked.\n\nRedlener thinks he knows why: It’s hard. A plan sounds like a good idea until, say, you face the question of what to do about your kids at school in case of a disaster. Do you go get them? Does your spouse? Traveling could be risky, so what are the school’s plans in an emergency? And how do you find out?\n\nSuddenly, you notice the lawn needs mowing.\n\nLast year two Wharton business school professors, Howard Kunreuther and Robert Meyer, published The Ostrich Paradox: Why We Underprepare for Disasters. They identify six unconscious biases that undercut our ability and willingness to prepare.\n\n•Myopia: We focus on the short term and have difficulty understanding long-term consequences, such as the 100-year flood.\n\n•Amnesia: We forget the past. We buy a condo in complex built where a storm once blew away a shopping center.\n\n•Inertia: We do what we’re doing until something drastic happens, when it’s too late. See New Orleans and Katrina in 2005.\n\n•Selectivity: We don’t look at all the information, or simplify to the point of inaccuracy. If we have an emergency checklist, we lose interest after covering a few items, without making sure they were the most important.\n\n•Herding: We make choices based on what the other person is doing. And so we both wind up treading water.\n\n•Optimism: This most American of traits leads us to underestimate risk, ignore worst-case scenarios and think bad things will only happen to others. It’s a great attitude for someone starting a business, not so much for someone living in a flood zone.\n\nThere are others factors, such as cost. Some people living in disaster-prone areas don’t move because they can’t afford to. Even assembling a comprehensive go-bag can be prohibitively expensive for some families.\n\nAnd there’s always sheer ignorance. Many people living along the New Jersey coast during Superstorm Sandy in 2012 had no idea what hurricanes do to barrier islands until they found their roads clogged with four feet of sand.\n\nA hard habit to change\n\nViral internet images and nonstop TV news coverage of this year’s disasters and disaster anniversaries have inspired some hope that Americans will begin to focus more on preparing for emergencies, rather than just reacting to them.\n\nBut Baker, the evacuation expert, says there’s little evidence that evacuation behavior is influenced by such things.\n\nIn 2005 he was conducting a survey of public evacuation attitudes on Long Island when Katrina struck New Orleans. He assumed that news of the disaster would ruin his study, skewing Long Islanders’ attitudes artificially and temporarily. Instead, he got the same kinds of responses after the storm as before it.\n\nHe says most people won’t change unless they’ve experienced something like a living room with 6 feet of water. But many Americans never face anything more perilous than a thunderstorm or a blizzard.\n\nA New York Times analysis this year of Small Business Administration data concluded that a relatively small part of the country has sustained most of the damage from major natural disasters; about 90 percent of the losses occurred in ZIP codes with less than 20 percent of the population.\n\nThe Wharton professors called their book \"The Ostrich Paradox\" because of a common misimpression.

I wanted to let her know I was interested in replacing Bill as undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department. At the time, I was vice-chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a global consulting firm. I already had several years of experience at State, first as assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs under former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and then as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s counselor in the 1990s.\n\nCheryl and I had some initial conversations that seemed to indicate I was being considered. Then things went silent. In Washington, interviewing for a major position is a bit of a blood sport. Reporters and pundits kick around names quite publicly, so success or failure is never a private matter. If I was going to be passed over, I wondered whether it was better that my name had fallen off the roster early. In any case, there was nothing further to be done.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSome weeks later, Cheryl called to say I was back under consideration. Would I meet her for a Sunday breakfast to discuss?\n\nWhen we met, Cheryl explained that the secretary was disposed favorably toward me but that a concern had been raised about me that I was not a team player and thus wouldn’t be a good fit. I strained to figure out where this was coming from. I thought perhaps it emanated from when I had been assistant secretary of legislative affairs, a post that required me to tell powerful people in the State Department that their priority was not the president’s and thus, they could not go up to Capitol Hill to push for their own agendas. It was hard to imagine that I’d be faulted years afterward for doing what was only my job. As we talked, however, it became clear that “not a team player” really meant “too assertive.”\n\nI was stunned. Throughout my career, I’d been called “tough.” It was a compliment that was regularly paid to women in Washington who demanded excellent work, but of course, it always sounded less begrudging when it was said of a man. In the competition for the political affairs job, “tough” had somehow become “too assertive.” Critiques like this one, along with being called “ambitious” or “aggressive,” are often lodged against women. They had been lodged against Secretary Clinton and Cheryl herself. Indeed, I was dismayed that these two very strong and powerful women believed about me the very unfair criticisms that had been pointed at them. Cheryl said she would get back to me.\n\nFinally, an evening meeting was set up at Secretary Clinton’s home in Washington. Hillary and I talked about the job itself and my ideas for how to do it, but eventually she brought up some of the same questions Cheryl had. She respected me enough to be direct with me about what she’d heard, and I answered with the same honesty, repeating what I’d told Cheryl. I left still not knowing if an offer would come.\n\nHachette Book Group\n\nIn Washington, no advocate is more valuable than the person who did the job before you, and did it well. Bill Burns, with whom I had worked closely during Bill Clinton's presidency, was one of my champions inside the department. He stepped in, telling the secretary that I would be a great team player. In the end, Secretary Clinton, with President Barack Obama’s agreement, nominated me to the post, and I became the first woman undersecretary of state for political affairs.\n\nIt was not the first time I realized what a tricky thing it is to be a powerful woman in Washington, nor was it the last. Two years later, for instance, in October 2013, I had to break the news to my Iran negotiation counterparts, known as the P5+1 and EU, that I had known about secret back-channel talks with Iran that had started in Oman months ago. This was an admission that revealed to them, and myself, that I had finally, fully assumed the mantle of U.S. power; that I was comfortable with negotiating from a place of strength and going it alone if necessary. It took the better part of a career in Washington, where calcified work structures make it so difficult for women, to learn how to be comfortable owning my own power—a necessary step if you are to wield it successfully.\n\nPower comes naturally to some people. I don’t think anyone who knew me as a teenager back in Baltimore would have picked me to be running a major nuclear arms deal 30 years later. My sister recalls me as a preteen homebody who liked to sit in her room and read.\n\nLuckily, since then, I’ve had wonderful role models who taught me how to understand power. One is my friend, former boss and business partner, Secretary Albright. Years ago, when she was serving as U.N. ambassador in the Clinton administration, Madeleine told me that the trick is not to simply wield your personal power, but to own the power of your office. Who, after all, can truly measure up to the outsize might of the United States? “When you sit across the negotiating table,” Madeleine told me, “you are the United States of America, not Wendy. If you know that and use that, it matters more than the fact that you’re a woman.” Madeleine showed me that owning that power was quite something.\n\nFormer Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, for whom I was chief of staff and then campaign manager in the 1980s, showed me one way of owning my power. Barbara doesn’t just assume a role—she transforms it by inhabiting it. Not even five feet tall and comfortably round, Barbara makes for an unlikely politician, as she acknowledged when running for the Senate in 1985. “I’m not particularly glamorous-looking,” she later told an interviewer about her difficulty measuring up to her primary opponents, Rep. Mike Barnes and Gov. Harry Hughes, also flatly stating that “I just didn’t look the part.” Barbara had no hope of growing more “senatorial,” saying, “I guess they don’t make togas in size 14 petite.”\n\nWatching Barbara over the past 40 years and more, I’ve seen that the powerful role you take on can eventually be—and should be—very close to the person you really are. You should change and grow in the role, but you can also change the way people think of the office you fill. Recalling how she was able to find her place in the male-dominated Senate in 1986 (there was only one other female senator when she arrived, Nancy Kassebaum), Barbara said her attitude was, “This is what the part looks like, and this is what the part is going to look like.\"\n\nI’ve learned a lot from men wielding their power too, and I’ve greatly admired many of them. The question of how women use their power, however, is far more complicated, more difficult and more urgent today than it is for men. Women, it must be said, have a strange relationship with power. We aren’t afraid of it necessarily, but we seem more comfortable with informal power than institutional power.\n\nEarly in my career, while organizing in local neighborhoods, I did a study with another social work student, looking at the evolution of leadership in neighborhood organizations. Most often those organizations were started by women who, in order to protect their children, wanted the city to install a traffic light at a busy intersection, or worried about safe drinking water for their families. Women got busy and got the job done, without asking whether they could do so, when they could do something for someone else. As soon as their efforts had attracted the backing of grants and donors—that is, at the point that advocacy became an organization—men invariably stepped in. Whether elected or self-appointed, men became the head of the organization once the women had built it.\n\nPerhaps this is why women are sometimes more comfortable working within a group. When I took on the job of Mikulski’s chief of staff in the House, I found solace in a group of female chiefs of staff (or “administrative assistants,” as both men and women were known then). Eleanor Lewis ran New York Rep. Gerry Ferraro’s team. Nancy LeaMond was chief of staff for Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio. Nikki Heidepriem had led efforts on behalf of women’s issues for the Democratic presidential campaign in 1984. Kitty Higgins worked for Michigan Rep. Sandy Levin.\n\nAt our monthly Chinese take-out dinners in one another's homes, we talked about common issues and brainstormed better ways to do our jobs and manage our personal lives. This bunch of seasoned political aides sustained me when I was learning the job on the fly, constantly playing catch-up and thinking sometimes that I was going to lose my mind.\n\nBut in those primitive days for women in the House, we did more than comfort one another. We proved, at least to one another, that it was possible to do our jobs and still live full lives and not go crazy. We talked one another through the rough spots and served as models for one another. It was only after I became pregnant with my daughter—I had told Barbara when she hired me that I hoped to have a child in the near future—that Nancy LeaMond felt that she could do the same. Just by being there, we established that we could be both women and chiefs of staff. In doing so, we changed one another and in ways large and small changed everyone’s expectations about working in the House.\n\nI would never give up the friendships I formed with those women. But looking back, I realize that we already had the skills to do our jobs before we started. We had the smarts to learn the ropes on our own. Women are often in denial about their own capabilities and search for others—groups of women or commanding men—to establish their power. When doing important personal work, like caring for our parents and children, the old and the young—both tasks that fall primarily to women—we are far more adept at adapting to new work and unfamiliar situations. When called on to make ends meet, we do what we must without stopping to doubt ourselves. Women excel at times when they have no choice but to take the job and do their best. Why can’t we have the same confidence in the jobs we want and like as well? We may not always have the knowledge going in, but I’d trust any woman to figure out nearly any job.\n\nGuys rarely question whether they can do the next job up. In my experience, they say yes and either worry about what they need to know later or—it’s been known to happen—not at all. There is research that indicates this isn’t just my own anecdotal observation. A widely cited internal study done by Hewlett-Packard in 2017 showed that men will apply for a job when they have 60 percent of the qualifications for the post; women will do so only when they can show that they have all of them.\n\nIt’s an open question precisely why women continue to deny their own capabilities, despite the past century of feminist activism. We know that women are still told to be quiet, and that we are still interrupted when we don’t comply. We know that men are told to push themselves forward while women are told to hang back. We worry when we are given more responsibility or more power, and too often we still believe that we don’t know enough, aren’t skilled enough, aren’t substantive enough, to do what the job we are applying for requires. When I became the assistant secretary for legislative affairs at the State Department, I’d already run a congressional representative’s office and a Senate campaign and served as executive director of both EMILY’s List and the Democratic National Committee during a national presidential campaign (Mike Dukakis’). My résumé was among the most accomplished in Washington. Yet when the job was offered to me, I was completely overwhelmed by what I didn’t know.\n\nNone of this is to say that confidence alone is enough to combat bias in fields where women are underrepresented. The field of national security and foreign policy has long been the domain of men. Although we have had three female secretaries of state, a glance at the major foreign policy publications and the panelists at major conferences will show that our security and diplomacy leaders are still predominantly men.\n\nIt is not our numbers alone that put us at a disadvantage. As undersecretary of state for political affairs, I often attended meetings in the White House Situation Room, the underground, secure conference room where senior policymakers debate the government’s way forward, often with the president in the room to finalize the decisions being made. At the time, the top positions on the National Security Council were all occupied by women, with Susan Rice as national security adviser and Avril Haines and Lisa Monaco as her deputies. These amazingly talented women, then all in their 40s, gave away nothing to male staffers in the depth of their analysis or their ability to articulate it. Yet even in this environment, men’s voices were heard differently than the women’s. As we went around the table giving our views on the topic of the day, one of the women would make a point. After one or two speakers had followed with further comments, a man at the table would inevitably repeat nearly verbatim the point made by Susan, Avril, Lisa or me. To my amazement, no one would remark that the point had already been made; rather, they would affirm their male colleague’s statement by saying, “Good point.”\n\nSoon a quiet realization dawned on us: We girls had to stick together. The women of the Situation Room developed an unspoken rule. When any man commented by repeating something that had been said earlier by a woman, one of the other women at the table would jump in. “I’m glad you agree with what ——— just said,” one of us would say about our female colleague’s identical comment, or else, “That builds nicely on the point ——— made just before.” We tried to be subtle—so subtle sometimes that I’m not convinced it always penetrated the consciousnesses of the men in the room. But we did what we could to make sure we were heard, affirmed and acknowledged, which was a wonderfully empowering experience.\n\nI try to do something similar when I do speaking engagements. After I’ve finished my prepared remarks, I customarily open the floor to questions. The first questioner is almost always a man, usually followed by another man. If by the fourth question no women have raised their hands, I stop the question period and say that I won’t continue until I hear from some of the women in the room. That brings nervous laughter, recognition and finally some raised hands from women.\n\nThe real drawback of this dynamic is that it affects how women do their jobs. When Madeleine Albright became the first female secretary of state, she understood that her first task was to assure people that she was strong enough to do the job. So she asked President Bill Clinton to nominate Strobe Talbott, Tom Pickering, Stu Eizenstat and Tim Wirth as her deputy and key undersecretaries. Rather than an admission that she needed men’s help, appointing men to these spots sent the message that she could handle, and even welcome, their strength. It must have been incredibly frustrating to constantly have to prove her ease with the role she was so clearly cut out for. For her closest staff, she hired women who could be counted on for a straightforward chat when she needed to get her thoughts in order—Elaine Shocas to be her chief of staff, with Suzy George as deputy chief of staff. Along with me as her counselor, Madeleine always had a travel companion with whom she could talk directly about her own use of power or, if needed, whether she needed to reapply her lipstick.\n\nMadeleine also had to take care to show that she was willing to fight. Not a warmonger by any stretch of the imagination, she did understand that women are perceived as hesitant to use force. As U.N. ambassador, she had burnished her credentials when she traveled with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General John Shalikashvili, to peacekeeping missions. When she became secretary, her approach to the conflict in Kosovo was so adept that Time magazine put her on the cover with the line, “Madeleine’s War.”\n\nWhen I consider how Madeleine managed to change the way we think of women in power, I see that she did it by embracing her femininity, by never falling into the trap of acting like a man to claim equality with men. Madeleine loves clothes and chooses what she wears with care. From her trademark brooches that she used to make diplomatic points to her impeccable style of dress and her love of popular culture, she didn’t allow the role of secretary of state to change the fact that she was a woman.\n\nEven working at the highest levels of government, I saw countless casual, workaday examples of the diminishment of women’s power, usually the kind dismissed as minor annoyances, the kind of jostling that can be found whenever men and women come together. As a group of us were sorting out last details on the eve of announcing the final Iran nuclear agreement in Vienna in 2015, some of the foreign ministers who had already arrived in town went to dinner with a few aides. It so happened that, because of the extraordinary composition of the P5+1 team, those of us still leading the work were mostly women. As we worked to get to closure on the last details of the agreement, text messages began to transmit back to some of us that some ministers were making derogatory jokes about how much more efficient the process would be if men were in charge. We agreed not to get distracted by the misogyny and just get the work done.\n\nOften, when women make an effort to be recognized, our demand to be valued isn’t enough—men have to validate us, as Bill Burns did for me with Secretary Clinton, or else other, more powerful women have to intervene.\n\nMore women need to stand up for each other. In many places, but especially in Washington, there is a tight cadre of guys in national security and foreign policy who recommend each other on a consistent basis for every good job that comes along. We women need to do the same for each other and insist that the boys’ network consider capable women as well when those jobs come along.\n\nMore than anything, women have to become more accustomed to getting power. And we need to recognize the power we already possess.\n\nWomen need to stop thinking that “power” is a dirty word, or that the trappings of power matter less than the work. When President Clinton and Secretary Albright asked me to come back to government as Madeleine’s counselor, I asked to be confirmed with the rank of ambassador. It was one of the smartest things I ever asked for. I knew that as a woman and without line authority, I needed some heft beyond the position, and so the Senate confirmed me as an ambassador. It has been immensely helpful. When, in that position, I led American delegations to, for instance, trilateral talks with Japan and South Korea on North Korea and all the delegations were men, being “Ambassador Sherman” undoubtedly helped when I dealt with North Korea. The title has been helpful ever since.\n\nWomen have a tremendous amount of power that comes with the roles we play in society, far more power than we ever had before. We cannot wield this power positively without understanding our strengths and owning them. At the same time, we have to appreciate that so many of the remaining obstacles to women’s advancement— most blatantly, perhaps, the sexual harassment in the workplace that has become an important topic of conversation—are all about power. We must each have the courage to stand up for what is right. We also need to rediscover the power of working collectively and become adept at using social media to speak with one voice. The challenge for many of us remains the interpersonal moments, when we have to risk being called tough, aggressive, even difficult. Our only response must be to continue to view—and use—power positively.\n\nAdapted from Not for the Faint of Heart: Lessons in Courage, Power, and Persistence by Ambassador Wendy R. Sherman.

Sake, a rice-based beverage brewed like beer but noncarbonated and higher in alcohol like wine, has been added to the state liquor code as a “vinous liquor.”\n\n“As of Aug. 8, sake will be regulated like a wine in the state of Colorado,” state department of revenue spokesman Lawrence Pacheco said. “That means that residents will be able to buy sake in winery sales rooms.”\n\nIf things go according to plan, Colorado Sake Co. will open the state’s first sake tasting room in Denver’s RiNo district in September. The business, a self-financed operation based in a 1,000-square-foot brew space behind Wine & Whey at 3559 Larimer St., was a major driver behind the law change. Now, it hopes to be at the forefront of a sake wave.\n\n“We’ve always loved sake and we wondered why don’t more people drink sake,” Heather Dennis, one of the company’s co-owners said last week as she and her partners worked to stockpile inventory in advance of the new sales rules. “We realized it was an issue with access or lack of access. That’s why we want the tasting room. To introduce and educate people.”\n\nColorado Sake Co.’s origins date back to 2016. That’s when co-founder William Stuart went to an event where he tasted sake made by Denver-based brewer Gaijin 24886.\n\n“I said, ‘I can do that,’ ” Stuart recalled. He went home, found a recipe online and kicked his roommates out of the fridge so he could ferment his creation at the requisite 50 degrees.\n\nSake has four ingredients: rice, water, yeast and koji, an Asian culinary ingredient made of steamed rice that has sprouted mold spores. Unlike beer, where yeast is added to malted grain after it cooks to produce alcohol, all the ingredients in sake brew simultaneously in a process called multiple parallel fermentation.\n\nStuart said it took him a year to master making koji. From there, he experimented until developing a sake recipe he was pleased with. In May 2017, he and his partners went to the state to get a limited winery license. They were rejected.\n\n“We were told, ‘You’re manufacturing beer and you’re selling wine,'” Stuart said.\n\nBecause of narrow definitions in the state liquor code, a rule change was needed to include and regulate sake. While it is well-known to consumers — often served hot, or in the form of a shot dropped into a beer, much to the chagrin of its advocates and aficionados — it is only produced by about 20 brewers in the Unites States today, according advocacy group the Sake Education Council.\n\nAfter being denied a license, the Colorado Sake Co. team embarked on a journey through the state lawmaking process that included talking to legislators, dealing with lobbyists and fielding questions from wineries and big-time beer makers, Stuart said. Finally, with the help of primary sponsors state Sen. Lucia Guzman, D-Denver, and Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, the change was signed into law on April 11.\n\n“Ever since the days of Hakushika Sake in Golden, sake has kind of occupied this sort of gray area in the liquor code,” said Doug Caskey, executive director of the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board, an offshoot of the state department of agriculture dedicated to marketing local wine, cider, mead and, now, sake. “It was really great we got this law changed.”\n\nHakushika Sake USA Corp., a private Japanese company, shut down in 2001, state records show.\n\nGaijin 24886 lost its space because of the new law, founder and brewer Marc Hughes said. The facility was licensed for beer production, not wine. But Gaijin is focused on the positives. It is working on finding a new location with aims to open a tasting room by next summer. In the meantime, a few varieties of Gaijin can be purchased at Divino Wine & Spirits at 1240 S. Broadway.\n\n“There is a lot of interest in experimentation with different things in town,” Hughes said of sake’s prospects in a crowded Denver liquor market. “It’s just about finding the right way to capture it.”\n\nColorado Sake Co. isn’t being distributed in liquor stores at the moment, but its flagship varieties, American Standard and the cinnamon and vanilla flavored Horchata Nigori, are on tap at Mizu Izakaya in Highland. The restaurant, at 1560 Boulder St., carries at least 50 sakes per season. Colorado Sake Co. is the only American brand it stocks.\n\n“I think that it’s just incredible that we are going to have the opportunity to get sake into more and more consumers’ hands,” Mizu beverage director Jerrica Ash said. “My goal is to make sake a spirit that in every restaurant not just in Asian restaurants.”", "clickbait": null}

But on Sunday, the once-dominant party scored its worst election result in generations. Its decline is a symptom of when liberal parties let radical-right populists dictate the political agenda.\n\nThe Social Democrats won a little over 28 percent of the vote, the most of any party but far short of giving their center-left bloc a majority. Meanwhile, the far-right Sweden Democrats won 17.6 percent of the vote in its best ever result. An exit poll showed that almost a fifth of the far-right voters cast their ballots for the Social Democrats the last election.\n\nThe result gives no party a clear route to forming a government, leaves the country politically fragmented and means that the ruling Social Democrats could potentially lose power.\n\nThe liberal party’s losses are at least partly self-inflicted. Faced with growing support for the Sweden Democrats, the Social Democrats focused much of their campaign on issues such as immigration and crime, where the far-right controls the narrative. And rather than countering the Sweden Democrats’ anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant rhetoric with a vision of their own, the liberals shifted to the right with proposals that included sending the army into neighborhoods with high crime rates.\n\n“They adopted the [Sweden Democrats’] agenda because they were afraid of losing voters,” said Ulf Bjereld, a professor at Gothenburg University and an active member of the Social Democrats.\n\n“It was a political mistake.”\n\nTT News Agency / Reuters Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Akesson gives a speech in Landskrona, Sweden, on Aug. 31, 2018.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats, which have origins in the neo-Nazi movement, have spent years telling Swedes that their country is in crisis. The party blames hordes of migrants for breaking the country’s beloved welfare state, bringing in crime and threatening Swedish identity.\n\nThat message has resonated with a growing number of people in recent years, as concerns rose over high-profile incidents of gang violence, an influx of refugees and regional economic inequality. Even some of their radical proposals and views found their way into the public debate. In June, a lawmaker’s comments that Jews and indigenous people don’t count as true Swedes received widespread attention. Similarly, the party’s proposal to only take in asylum-seekers from Nordic nations is a de facto ban on refugees that goes against Sweden’s history as one of the world’s most humanitarian nations.\n\nThe far-right party further benefited from establishment parties’ lack of attention to its rhetoric. That silence, experts say, created an information vacuum that the Sweden Democrats filled with anti-migrant, ethnonationalist views\n\n“If nobody is talking about stuff that people see as problems, the only answers and understanding that they’re going to have are the ones offered by the populist parties. That’s what you basically had in Sweden,” said Sheri Berman, a professor of politics at Barnard College.\n\nThe far-right’s claims, experts say, often did not match reality. Although Sweden has real struggles with regional inequality, social change and increasing violence, overall crime rates have dropped, the country is witnessing the highest economic growth in decades and income has increased across the board. The number of killings has risen in recent years, but there were still only 113 murders last year out of a population of nearly 10 million people, and there have been similar peaks since the government began reporting those statistics in 2002. As for Sweden Democrats’ warning of the “Islamization” of Sweden, the average Swede vastly overestimates the percentage of the population that is Muslim.\n\nWhen the Social Democrats finally did address public concerns over immigration and crime during the campaign earlier this year, the party mimicked many of the talking points and policies of the far-right. The government’s finance minister suggested refugees seek another country in which to claim asylum, while Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced that the country would crack down on criminals, and the party declared that emergency border security laws from the height of the refugee crisis would be kept in place indefinitely.\n\nBut embracing more conservative policies backfired ― support for the Social Democrats dropped even further, and one member of the Swedish parliament resigned from the party in protest.\n\n“A strategy that was tried to win back voters from the Sweden Democrats meant that the Social Democrats fell even more,” said Bjereld.\n\n“The parties who have been true to their ideological grounds ― they are the only parties who have raised in support.”\n\nJONATHAN NACKSTRAND via Getty Images Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven addresses an election campaign rally attended by Spain's prime minister in Enkoping, Sweden, on Sept. 5, 2018.\n\nThat same scenario has played out similarly in countries across Europe, where traditional left and right parties have employed similar strategies to regain voters from populist parties, largely without success.\n\n“What happens is that xenophobia, racism, anti-immigration ideas become more recognized and legitimate ... because the big parties, the power-holding parties are jumping on them,” said Emilia Palonen, an expert on populism at the University of Helsinki.\n\n“These mainstream parties should be bringing in new issues, new excitement into politics, and instead they’re following.”\n\nRather than copying the far-right’s emotional appeals toward identity and its criticism of the state, mainstream parties should offer voters fresh alternatives, Berman said.", "clickbait": null}

Of those, 3,076 are still under suppression orders that keep the details away from the public — 345 are felony criminal cases — as they work their way through the legal system, according to state computer records.\n\nUntil recently, no information about any of the suppressed cases was available publicly — not the names of the defendants, the charges they faced or even the identity of the judges who closed them — until The Post began questioning the practice.\n\nThe Post identified 66 felony cases that remained closed to the public — including homicides and sex crimes requiring registration as a sexual offender — even though the defendants had already been convicted and sentenced, some to lengthy prison terms.\n\nIn every suppressed case, The Post found, the judge’s suppression order and the reasons supporting it are shielded from public scrutiny. Courthouse employees and many law enforcement officials, including prosecutors, will not even acknowledge the suppressed cases exist, The Post found.\n\nThat means someone could be arrested, charged, convicted and sent to prison in Colorado without anyone seeing why, how or where, and whether the process was fair.\n\n“This sounds like the Star Chamber to me,” said Alan Chen, a constitutional law professor at University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law, referring to the 15th-century English court chastised for arbitrary rulings and secret proceedings. “Colorado is one of the worst states in terms of access to criminal court records for reasons I really have no explanation for. I’ve not heard of this being practiced anywhere else in the country. It’s frightening that if anything improper is going on, no one will know about it or have any way to find out.”\n\nAlthough courtrooms remain open to the public, including hearings for suppressed cases, the only way to know when a hearing is to occur is to be there when it is scheduled. A Denver Post reporter happened to attend one hearing in which a murder suspect pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and no public record of the event existed. The only way to learn the defendant’s name was to be there when the judge announced it.\n\nAccording to interviews and analysis of cases that were later opened to the public, the reasons behind a suppression order are varied: Prosecutors don’t want to alarm other members of a drug ring as they’re being rounded up; the case involves a juvenile defendant; or law enforcement says a criminal investigation is ongoing. Civil cases have been suppressed as well, typically — though not all — to shield victims of abuse or sexual assaults from publicity.\n\nBut there are other reasons as well. The Post found one criminal case — that of a board member and part-owner of the Broomfield Academy charged and convicted of felony sexual assault of a child and misdemeanor child abuse — in which prosecutors requested and received a suppression order to avoid publicity. The case remains suppressed.\n\nIt found another — of a member of the Adams County 14 school board eventually convicted with attempting to lure a child for sex — in which the judge ordered the suppression at the outset, without anyone even asking for it, because the judge “had concerns about releasing information,” records obtained by The Post show. The case remains suppressed.\n\nThe case of Clifford Galley, 28, convicted of attempted first-degree murder, was one of a number The Post found that remained suppressed long after the defendant went to prison. Galley was sentenced to 169 years in prison and won’t see freedom in his lifetime. Documents related to the case were suppressed after his arrest in 2013 and no one except for his lawyer, prosecutors or a judge could see them. Last month, a judge lifted the suppression order after The Post asked prosecutors questions about it. His appeal, however, remains suppressed.\n\nDenver Post emails to several of the judges responsible for suppressed cases went unanswered except for one, and that judge passed it along to state court administrators to respond.\n\nSuppressed cases are different than those sealed by the court, the reasons for which are limited by state law. Sealed cases are restricted to those where a defendant was exonerated or, under certain conditions, the case was dismissed, such as with a deferred sentence. Some low-level drug felonies can also be sealed under specific criteria.\n\nBy contrast, a judge may suppress a case for any reason at his or her discretion — usually, but not always, at the request of lawyers in the case, but most frequently prosecutors. Once a case is suppressed, it remains so until a judge reopens it, which The Post found often does not happen because neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors ever bother to ask.\n\n“This isn’t right; it can’t be right. It’s a chance for them to victimize our family all over again,” said Mark Chalfant, whose son, Mark, was killed in a Taco Bell parking lot in Aurora in July 2014. Four teenagers were convicted in the case — one as a juvenile — yet all the records remain closed under suppression orders three years later.\n\nHow news coverage of two high-profile sex-crime cases faded after they were suppressed by Colorado judges Douglas County sheriff’s officers had arrested one of their own — Deputy Robert “Mike” French — in the early hours of Feb. 9, 2013, on suspicion of trying to lure a 16-year-old boy into a sexual relationship. It was a Saturday and French, then 41, was taken to the Douglas County Detention Facility at about 3:30 a.m. He was kept there until he was to appear before a judge two days later. On Monday morning, before any word that French had been arrested was made public, Senior Deputy District Attorney Jay Williford asked a judge to suppress the case and all the information surrounding French’s arrest and the crimes he was accused of committing, court records show. The judge agreed. Continue reading\n\nAlthough media attention about the shooting and the arrests was widespread, the court cases were immediately suppressed. Only the 30-year sentence of triggerman Sterling Hook made a headline in a local newspaper a year later — after prosecutors released the information.\n\n“No one else ever gets to know what they’ve done,” Chalfant said, noting that no one other than family attended court hearings spread over a year. “That’s just wrong.“\n\nCourt records “critically important”\n\nOpen-records experts and several attorneys interviewed by The Post were troubled by the newspaper’s findings, saying it runs against the Colorado and U.S. constitutions and their guarantee of an open and accessible court system.\n\n“Court records in general are a critically important source of information for the public,” said Jeff Roberts, executive director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. “Without access to court records and proceedings, Coloradans can’t monitor the judicial system. They can’t know whether it’s working properly or not.”\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court in June refused to declare that access to court records is an absolute right guaranteed by the First Amendment or the Colorado Constitution. But that decision dealt with a specific document that had been sealed within a court file, not the entire case itself or its details.\n\nThe Post’s investigation also found:\n\n— Most suppressed cases had scant or no media attention, and the majority of the few that did were typically at the time of a defendant’s arrest, before anything was suppressed by a judge. Several suppressed cases did get press coverage when charges were filed and again after a defendant was sentenced, when prosecutors issued an announcement — but nothing in between.\n\n— Until recently, no trace of a suppressed case existed in the public-access computers the state provides at county courthouses throughout Colorado, or the online for-pay services that compile the same data and the state recommends to the public. That has changed since The Post began inquiring. Until last week, the public still could not see what charges had been brought against a person in a suppressed case or see any details about it, such as the next court hearing or any sentence given.\n\n— Sealed cases are restricted by law to only the judge who issued the order, and acknowledging their existence is prohibited. Public information about suppressed cases, however, per Colorado Supreme Court rule, should include names and case numbers, though the details of a case and the courtroom proceedings around it have been restricted. Despite that, court officials and some prosecutors’ offices still treat the two types of cases as the same and refuse to give any information about a suppressed case.\n\n— Public schedules posted daily outside of courtrooms, called dockets, show the cases being heard that day, including the names of defendants. If the case is suppressed, however, the docket only shows that a time is allotted for a hearing, but not why or for whom.\n\n— Even high-profile cases that received intense publicity are under suppression orders, meaning access to any of their court records today is prohibited. Among them: Aurora theater shooter James Holmes; witness killers Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray; and Jessica Ridgeway killer Austin Sigg. The media was able to follow these cases by appearing at a public court hearing to learn when the next was to be held. Many times prosecutors and defense lawyers say they simply forgot the case was still suppressed.\n\n“That’s very troubling”\n\nThe Denver Post began investigating suppressed cases in Colorado nearly a year ago after reporters were denied access to records and expressed concern about the practice. The Post obtained data from the State Court Administrator that helped it determine the extent to which suppressions have been used in each judicial district in Colorado. The Post then reviewed dozens of suppressed cases that have been unsuppressed to see how the practice was being used.\n\nSince 2013, there have been 6,707 cases suppressed by judges in Colorado, and the bulk of them were criminal cases, The Post found — misdemeanors first, then felonies, followed by civil court matters. A judge’s suppression order was lifted in 3,631 of them, meaning the public can now access the cases, sometimes soon after a defendant was arrested or parties to a civil lawsuit were served with court papers, records show.\n\n“Generally it’s one thing to suppress a (single) document, which is very legitimate, but when entire files begin to disappear from the public record, that’s very troubling,” Denver attorney Larry Pozner said. “We’re very skeptical in America of things done in the dark, and other than juvenile law, you can walk into an American courtroom and take notes, and they can’t say, ‘It’s none of your business, get out of here.’ ”\n\nThe Post’s analysis found that the number of suppressed cases varies dramatically from county to county. Prosecutors in La Plata County, where Durango is the county seat, have suppressed 366 felony cases over the past five years, the most by any jurisdiction, records show. But those cases were nearly always unsuppressed once a defendant was arrested and brought to court, the longest taking two years, The Post found.\n\n“It’s not uncommon to suppress a case until the defendant is arrested and the warrant served,” said Christian Champagne, district attorney for Colorado’s Sixth Judicial District that includes La Plata, Archuleta and San Juan counties. “Ours is an area where people come through and leave for long stretches of time.”\n\nIn the 18th Judicial District, which is made up of Arapahoe, Douglas, Lincoln and Elbert counties, 62 cases are still suppressed from public view even though the defendants have been tried, convicted and sentenced, The Post found, the highest among the state’s 22 judicial districts. The majority of the cases — 47, most of them from a single drug-conspiracy investigation from four years ago — are in Arapahoe County, followed by 14 others in Douglas County, and one in Elbert County.\n\nThat total doesn’t include 115 active felony cases that are still under suppression in the district — nearly half the statewide total, The Post found.\n\n“I still think there are some legitimate reasons on behalf of the safety of certain victims and witnesses … that we ought to have the ability to continue to suppress those,” 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler said.\n\nIn 2015, prosecutors asked that the Douglas County sex-assault case against Broomfield Academy then-owner and board member Michael Greenberg, 62, be suppressed because it likely would garner a lot of media attention. A television station reported his arrest. There was no media report after the suppression order was issued. The private school is to close this year, according to its website.\n\nThe case has remained suppressed ever since even though Greenberg pleaded guilty to felony sexual assault of a child in which he received a four-year deferred sentence, and to a misdemeanor charge of child abuse. He is a registered sex-offender in Centennial, records show. Following The Post’s inquiry, prosecutors have asked a judge to unsuppress the case.\n\n“Our office filed a motion to suppress, the reason being is that the case would be subject to extensive pretrial publicity,” Brauchler’s Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Rich Orman told The Post in an email, saying he and Brauchler were not consulted by the DA who handled the case. “This was a mistake, and we should not have sought suppression of a court file for this reason.”\n\nBrauchler said suppression orders sometimes are important to solving serious crimes, but concedes that once their usefulness is over, cases should not remain hidden from public scrutiny.\n\n“Already in many cases, specifically gang and some domestic violence cases, the concern over an individual’s own safety is so strong that if you can’t provide some other assurance, even in the short-term, I think we’ll lose out on cooperation from a lot of key witnesses,” Brauchler said. “But the public should maintain the ability to scrutinize what we do, why we do it and how we go about that.”\n\nAfter speaking with The Post, Brauchler’s office began unsuppressing many of the cases and instituted policies limiting how the practice should be used in the future. There are some cases, however, that Brauchler said should remain suppressed for the safety of the defendant — one of whom is serving a 16-year prison term in a rural county jail after having testified against another defendant who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, records show.\n\nThere have been no suppressed cases involving a criminal defendant in Denver District Court the past five years, the years The Post reviewed, according to records.\n\n“This is just a completely foreign procedure in my years of experience as a district attorney,” said former Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey. “In my 33 years, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never even heard of suppressing an entire case. How can you have cases that don’t even show up on a court docket? I’ve never seen such a thing.”\n\nExperts in open-records law say the practice of suppressing entire cases rubs against the grain of a system intended to be transparent.\n\n“The most outrageous, unjustifiable and unconstitutional thing you’ve found is the public being denied the right to know which cases are on file in our courts of law against which defendants, and to have access, at the minimum, to the indexes of those cases,” said Denver attorney Steven Zansberg, an expert on open-records laws who represents a number of media outlets including The Denver Post.\n\n“How is there a case where the public doesn’t know how or why someone is arrested or in prison?” he asked. “Courts throughout the land have held the public — we the people — have a constitutional First Amendment right to have access to those records.”\n\nMany cases suppressed\n\nWhen Frank Huner Jr., a 58-year-old Sedalia man, was charged in July 2017 with first-degree murder for allegedly killing his son, whom he said he mistook for an intruder, news of his arrest peppered the media.\n\nSince then, however, there’s been not a word about the Douglas County case — and not a single reference to it could be found anywhere among the state’s courthouse databases available for the public to search criminal and civil cases. Courthouse employees refused to identify the case even existed.\n\nDuring the course of The Post’s investigation, the State Court Administrator has changed the computer programs that provide the public with information about criminal and civil cases so that a defendant’s name, case number and the county where the case is being heard is displayed.\n\nUntil a week ago the public could not see the charges they faced or details about a suppressed case’s progress through the judicial system.\n\nSuch is the case of Daniel Pesch, a 34-year-old Littleton man charged in December 2017 for the 2010 murder of Kiowa High School science teacher Randy Wilson. The case has been suppressed since the moment it was filed, even though the media covered Pesch’s arrest. It’s only been recently unsuppressed after dozens of hearings. Still, several key portions of the case remain concealed from public view.\n\nAs well with Jeffrey Falk, 54, a former ThunderRidge High School math teacher sentenced in June 2016 to 21 years in prison for victimizing young boys and collecting “a library of child porn.” He had pleaded guilty in Arapahoe County district court to three counts of sexual exploitation of a child two months earlier.\n\nHis arrest in 2015 made headlines, but the four cases against him were immediately suppressed until he was sentenced. No other stories were published until after he pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and prosecutors later made a public announcement in June 2016.\n\nOne of the four cases against Falk was unsuppressed a month after that, records show — but the other three felony cases for which he was sentenced remained closed. That changed on June 13 after The Post began asking why.\n\nThe first-degree murder case in Adams County against juvenile Aidan Zellmer remains suppressed even though a judge has already ruled the 15-year-old is to stand trial as an adult.\n\nAnd despite media coverage about the case, the warrant affidavit that describes the evidence that led to Zellmer’s arrest remains suppressed, as well as any other information about the case against him.\n\nEven when a defendant has been charged, convicted and sent to prison, if the case is suppressed, some district attorney’s offices still treat it as if the matter has been sealed, even though the two are very different.\n\n“The short answer is that suppressed and sealed means the same thing to the extent the public is barred from access,” Denver district attorney’s office spokesman Ken Lane told The Post when asked to provide information about a suppressed case from 2013 in which Denver was the special prosecutor in a different county. “So, if whatever case you’re referring to is in fact suppressed by a court order, then respectfully, I’m not going to violate a court order and release case information to the public.”", "clickbait": null}

The Torah is the central holy text in Judaism. (Photo: Hannah Gaber/The Republic)\n\nEach year, 163 days after Passover, the Jewish community celebrates Rosh Hashana, which marks the beginning of the High Holy Days leading up to Yom Kippur.\n\nThe two-day celebration of Rosh Hashana began this year at sundown Sunday and will continue through Tuesday night.\n\nThe phrase means “head of the year.\" But the holiday actually takes place in the seventh month of the Jewish calendar (the months don't exactly line up to a traditional Gregorian calendar, but the seventh month usually takes place in September and October).\n\nThe celebration is actually considered the birth or creation of the world, rather than marking the passage of a year around the sun. According to Orthodox tradition, Rosh Hashana, which also is spelled Rosh Hashanah, is the anniversary of when the breath of life entered lumps of clay and created Adam and Eve.\n\nIn other words, the Jewish holiday celebrates the creation of humanity.\n\nSeptember 2017: What is Yom Kippur? How do Jews observe it?\n\nSeptember 2017: When is Rosh Hashanah 2017 and what are Jews celebrating?\n\nThose attending synagogue services will hear the sound of a ram's horn being blown. In all, the ceremonial horn (called a shofar) is blown 100 times. The first trumpeting of the shofar starts a 10-day period known as the \"days of awe\" through Yom Kippur, which is the \"day of atonement.\" This year, Yom Kippur begins on the evening of Sept. 18 and ends the evening of Sept. 19.\n\nAn ultra-Orthodox Jew performs a Jewish ritual called 'Kaparot,' performed before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement and the holiest of Jewish holidays, in Beit Shemesh, Israel, on Sept. 28, 2017. The Kaparot is a blessing and prayer recited as a live fowl, or chicken is passed over a person's head, symbolically transferring that person's sins accumulated over the past year into the bird, which is butchered and eaten or donated to charity. (Photo: ABIR SULTAN, EPA-EFE)\n\nDuring this time, Jews believe the Book of Life is opened, and God writes down what their upcoming year will hold. Over the 10 days, believers seek forgiveness and try to make amends for wrongs against God or other people.\n\nOn the 10th day, according to Jewish belief, God closes the book, sealing the future in stone for the year. This 10th day, known as Yom Kippur, is when observant Jews fast for about 24 hours. The fast is broken when the shofar blows again.\n\nContributing: Ali Phillips and Hannah Gaber, The Arizona Republic.

The first 1,000 shoppers get a free reusable bag.\n\nIt remains to be seen if that event will generate the same kind of fervor H&M did. After all, Target is well known in Colorado, having operated stores here for decades. It’s got brand recognition but isn’t trendy or new like its Scandinavian counterpart.\n\nRegardless of how many people line up before the new store’s doors are flung open at 1600 California St., downtown business advocates are ecstatic over its arrival and what it says about the economic vitality of a portion of Denver sporting a retail vacancy rate of 3.3 percent.\n\n“When Target chooses to locate somewhere they are sending a message that the customer base is there,” Downtown Denver Partnership CEO Tami Door said Monday. “This shows this brand has identified the center city of Denver — and it sends this message to other brands — as a place where they believe they will be successful.”\n\nThe 16th Street Mall store won’t be just any Target. At 30,000 square feet, it’s less than quarter the size of the retailer’s average store. It will feature a curated collection of goods designed to appeal to downtown shoppers, Ashlee Justis, the store’s team lead, said.\n\nOn its main floor, the second floor of the 1600 California St. building, shoppers will find clothes and accessories — including Broncos and other local team gear — and an electronics and entertainment department complete with cellphones that can be activated on the spot. There will be a grocery section with fresh produce and frozen goods, as well as grab-and-go items such as sandwiches, meant to cater to customers popping in and out on their lunch breaks.\n\nFloor two will carry cosmetics and personal care products and travel goods — again catering to a specific downtown market segment: tourists. There will also be an assortment of home wares and decor, a category H&M added to its 16th Street Mall store in 2015.\n\n“Why this is going to be so exciting, especially for the downtown Denver guest, is this store is created especially for them,” Justis said. “It’s going to be a quick, convenient spot to get those products you have relied on Target for traditionally.”\n\nDoubling down on the convenience, the store will have a CVS pharmacy and self-checkout kiosks. It will also serve as the order pickup point for people who buy from Target.com, company officials say. Place an order on the website, and within an hour that item will be ready at the store.\n\nThe store is an example of Target’s real estate evolution. After going from big to jumbo in the form of its Super Target store formats, the company is now going small. When the 16th Street Mall store opens it will be one of 71 small format stores the retailer has opened across the country. Meant to fit in denser urban centers or near college campuses, the smaller footprint allows Target close places it hasn’t been before, such as downtown Denver, company spokeswoman Jacqueline DeBuse said.\n\n“We’ve always been interested in the (downtown) Denver community,” DeBuse said. “We know there are daytime professionals and round-the-clock residents.”\n\nDeBuse’s reference to round-the-clock residents offers a potential clue as to why it has taken Target so long to hit its mark downtown. The Downtown Denver Partnership’s CEO Door said her organization has been working on bringing the brand to the city’s urban core for decades. Every time an opportunity came up, some factor dragged it down, whether the location or property owner wasn’t the right fit, or Target not being in an expansion mode at the time, or the demographics not being strong enough.\n\n“When you’re working to attract a retail location, everything has to be right,” she said.\n\nIn downtown Denver today — defined by the partnership as the area made up of the Auraria, Lower Downtown, Ballpark, Central Platte Valley, Golden Triangle and Center Business District neighborhoods — more people are working, visiting and living than ever before. Randy Thelen, the partnership’s vice president of economic development, said 23,000 people live downtown, three times as many as 2000. The area’s 136,000 employees is an all-time high. Add that in with a $4 million tax incentive package from the Denver City Council, and the “Why now, Target?” question answers itself.", "clickbait": null}

It’s also become an official White House position, after the communications office distributed talking points last week to outside surrogates titled “Big Tech is Suppressing Conservative Voices.”\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe talking points, which were obtained by POLITICO, highlight a New York Times story about Facebook employees alleging on an internal message board that the company is “intolerant” of perspectives that differ with its left-leaning culture. The talking points also target Twitter for discriminating against Republicans by limiting users’ ability to find them in searches, and Google for showing the word “Nazism” next to search results for the California Republican Party.\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe tech companies have repeatedly rejected the idea that their platforms are intentionally biased. They argue that in cases where partisan leanings are detected in their algorithms, design choices or enforcement decisions, they are quickly fixed. The supposed record of bias, their defenders argue, is hugely anecdotal.\n\nBut conservatives have in recent years repeatedly pointed to signs that the tech industry’s liberal leanings are manifested in the tools it has built, typified by so-called shadow banning, or quiet suppression, of Republican activity on the social-media platforms.\n\nThe president’s embrace of anti-Silicon Valley rhetoric has been shaped by advisers who see it as the latest front in the country’s long-running culture wars and believe it has the potential to rally conservative voters ahead of the midterms and the president’s own reelection campaign in 2020. They include Brad Parscale, the manager of Trump’s reelection campaign; Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son; Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel; and Fox News personalities Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson.\n\nIn May, Parscale and McDaniel wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey demanding an end to “bias against conservative content.” Parscale and McDaniel met with Facebook executives in June alongside House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who conservatives see as another major conduit between the tech companies and the president.\n\nThe California Republican helped popularize the hashtag #StopTheBias, which has been picked up by Trump and top surrogates like Trump Jr. McCarthy has had several conversations with the president about social media bias, using personal anecdotes and examples of the companies' slanted treatment against conservatives to drive home his point, according to a Republican with knowledge of their discussions.\n\n“Conservatives invested a lot of money in building up their Facebook presences, and they did really well for a while,” Zach Graves, head of policy at the San Francisco-based right-of-center tech advocacy group Lincoln Network, told POLITICO. “Then Facebook changed the algorithm, and engagement dropped off a cliff. Now they’re practically worthless.”\n\nConservative allies of the White House have publicly suggested a range of policy remedies, including imposing government oversight of the tech sector by treating companies like public utilities. Another option being discussed informally in conservative circles: a push to eliminate tech companies’ protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits firms like Google’s liability for the content hosted on their platforms.\n\nRumors have circulated in Washington in recent days that the White House is workshopping ideas for a Google-targeting executive order. Several people inside the White House denied working on such a project.\n\nThe roots of conservative suspicions about social media can be traced back to a May 2016 report by the tech publication Gizmodo in which an unnamed Facebook source said the site’s in-house curators “routinely suppressed conservative news” in its trending news section. Coming at the height of the fraught U.S. presidential primaries — Trump was in the final weeks of sewing up the Republican nomination — the debate quickly became highly politically charged.\n\nThe president, who tweets avidly but doesn’t use a computer or consume social media himself, has repeatedly tweeted about his frustrations with tech companies, accusing Google of rigging search results to show only stories from the “Fake News Media” and Twitter “shadow banning” prominent Republicans.\n\n“[V]irtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,” Trump said in a Tuesday interview with the Daily Caller, accusing tech firms of interfering in the 2016 and 2018 elections.\n\nThe Justice Department signaled this week that it is taking the president’s concerns seriously. In a Wednesday statement, the department announced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is organizing a meeting, slated for Sept. 25, with state attorneys general “to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.”\n\nIn response to a Trump tweet criticizing Google last week, Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser, said the administration is even “taking a look” at imposing regulations on the internet giant, sending shock waves through the tech world as it scrambled to figure out what such a move might look like.\n\nTrump later appeared to walk back Kudlow’s comments, saying he wants “fairness,” not regulation — and White House officials declined to detail any policy other policy responses that are in the works. Current and former administration officials said they are often unsure whether the president’s Twitter pronouncements — from threatening to take away NBC News' license to looking into South Africa’s land policies — should be taken seriously and followed up with a suite of policy options.\n\n“Many of us operated on the assumption that this kind of stuff is just a PR, messaging ploy,” one former administration official said.\n\nDuring a Wednesday House hearing on the topic, Dorsey testified that while “we recognize that even a model created without deliberate bias may nevertheless result in biased outcomes,” as a company, “we believe strongly in being impartial, and we strive to enforce our rules impartially.”\n\nRepublicans, though, kept up their criticisms of the social network throughout the course of the hearing. Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana highlighted what he called examples of Twitter practices that seem to have “selectively adversely affected conservatives” — including an October 2017 campaign ad from Republican Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn that was temporarily rejected by the company over its mentions of abortion.\n\nThe following day, Twitter moved to permanently suspend provocateur Alex Jones and his far-right InfoWars, citing tweets and videos that violate its abusive behavior policy.\n\nSome close to Trump have started to worry that the president will undercut efforts to address the problems tech companies have already acknowledged by embracing some of the conspiracy-theory-laden elements of conservatives’ allegations against tech companies. One source close to the White House argued that Trump didn’t help his cause by tweeting out a video that falsely claimed Google didn’t promote his State of the Union addresses the way it promoted former President Barack Obama’s.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's critics see considerable irony in the fact that Twitter's most powerful user is complaining about bias when it has long been his preferred venue to tend to his grievances before an audience of more than 50 million.\n\nDemocrats dismiss Trump’s embrace of the attacks on major tech companies as politically motivated. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, accused Trump on Wednesday of peddling “conspiracy theories about Twitter and other social media platforms to whip up their base and fundraise.”\n\n", "clickbait": null}

Ocasio-Cortez, a Latina woman, and Pressley, a black woman, both defeated long-time incumbents of U.S. Congress seats in New York and Massachusetts; Gillum, a black man, won the open primary in Florida’s governor race.\n\nNixon, a first-time candidate without governing experience, is known for her years starring on HBO’s “Sex and the City,” set in New York. She is hoping to repeat the success of other less-heralded names in Thursday’s nominating contest against Cuomo, who is seeking a third term.\n\n“People keep underestimating insurgent candidates, particularly first-time candidates,” said Nixon, who is running antagonistically to Cuomo’s left.\n\nNixon’s opposition mirrors those of others who argue Democrats nationwide have been far too cautious in embracing progressive proposals, wary of alienating more moderate voters.\n\nOcasio-Cortez’s victory in June’s nominating race over 10-term U.S. Representative Joe Crowley sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party. The Republican Party controls both the House of Representatives and the Senate and the Nov. 6 congressional elections will determine whether they keep their majorities.\n\nNominating contests are hard to poll, and while those other races went against incumbents, lower-profile candidates do not always succeed: Joe Manchin and Tom Carper, incumbent U.S. Democratic senators in West Virginia and Delaware, both defeated challengers from the left.\n\nNixon, 52, has lagged more than 30 points behind Cuomo in opinion polls, and he has outraised her nearly 50 times over, though far more of Nixon’s support comes from small donors.\n\nShe says Cuomo, 60, the son of a former governor, is out of touch with the party’s diverse ranks, and too aligned with conservative Republicans and moneyed corporations to be running one of the country’s most liberal states. Cuomo is one of 16 Democratic governors nationwide. There are 33 Republicans and one independent.\n\nCuomo has talked more about U.S. President Donald Trump on the campaign and his aides have derided Nixon as a talented but unqualified actress.\n\nCynthia Nixon speaks during the Democratic gubernatorial primary debate with Cynthia Nixon at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York August 29, 2018. J. Conrad Williams Jr./Pool via REUTERS\n\nCuomo has drawn the ire of some voters, angered that he for years allowed several Democratic members of the state’s senate to caucus with Republicans to give that party the advantage in the statehouse.\n\nCuomo counters that he has a record of passing same-sex marriage and paid family leave in New York state. The winner on Thursday faces Republican Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, in November.\n\nNixon’s distrust is shared by supporters such as Zakiyah Ansari, who stood by Nixon as she canvassed outside her childhood elementary school on Manhattan’s Upper West Side on Friday morning, hyping her up to passersby.\n\n“They don’t poll people like me,” said Ansari, a director at New York’s Alliance for Quality Education, a public school advocacy group where Nixon has been a spokeswoman for 17 years. “I don’t believe they call us, black and brown folks, poor people.”\n\nBoth Cuomo and newspaper editorial boards have criticized Nixon’s lack of management experience and cast her proposals, particularly her plan for state universal health care, as fantastically expensive. Nixon has been vague on funding beyond saying there are plenty of rich people in New York to tax.\n\nAt the school, Nixon stood on the sidewalk where parents and children were filing by, her right hand floating out before her, sometimes ignored by passersby but more often shaken as people recognized her face.\n\n“‘Sex and the City’ got me through college!” Brittany James, a 34-year-old teacher, told Nixon. “You’ve got my vote.”\n\nShabd Simon-Alexander, a 37-year-old political organizer from Brooklyn, said Nixon had proved her worth as a political activist, and her platform could turn out new voters.\n\n“All you need is people in the street, knocking on doors, going to vote,” Simon-Alexander said.\n\nNixon acknowledged her celebrity has drawn more attention than most first-time candidates, but, she said, “What gets them on board is the issues that I’m talking about.”\n\nLater at a fundraiser in a dark, expensive bar in the Meatpacking District, a neighborhood used as a backdrop on “Sex and the City,” Nixon said: “We are taking the Democratic Party back,” the crowd cheering at just the mention of three names: Ocasio-Cortez, Gillum, Pressley. “It’s happening,” she said.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)", "clickbait": null}

The president is amoral, Anonymous wrote. He’s anti-democratic. He’s impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective. He flip-flops. He can’t stay on topic and is given to repetitive rants. He’s unstable, says the piece, whose headline and dek tell the story: “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration: I work for the president but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnonymous, perhaps the deepest Deep Throat since Watergate, continues: He’s only one member of the Trump administration’s internal resistance—he and others monkey-wrenched the White House operation to “do what’s right when Donald Trump won’t.” That’s not news, either, as the press has charted the foot-draggers in the administration. Just Tuesday, we learned from Bob Woodward’s anonymously sourced new book, Fear: Trump in the White House, that aides have pilfered papers from the president’s desk to prevent him from signing them. But the Times’ anonymous op-ed writer makes the case that there’s an ongoing insurrection within the administration. If true, that means 1) Donald Trump, our elected president, isn’t in control of his own team and 2) that the show is being run by anonymous bureaucrats who, depending on how you look at it, are self-anointed patriots or traitors. (We know where the president stands: As I filed this, Trump tweeted simply: “TREASON?”)\n\nThe op-ed sent Washington ass-over-applecart because it breaks with the Washington tradition that holds that the accepted way for a government whistleblower to undermine an administration is to leak information to the press (Mark Felt, the original Deep Throat), pilfer documents (Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers), or make themselves visible and resign in protest (Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William D. Ruckelshaus in Watergate’s Saturday Night Massacre) and join the opposition. For somebody with the paranoiac tendencies of Donald Trump, the op-ed has got to look like something worse than the “deep state” he’s always harping about. It’s like a silent coup.\n\nIt goes without saying that the president and his muscle will tear the plasterboard off the West Wing to unmask and punish Anonymous and his confreres. But seeing as Anonymous’ identity is news, the press hounds will be baying, too. Ordinarily, reporters avoid exposing the anonymous sources of other reporters because they don’t want to set a precedent that will result in their sources getting outed.\n\nThe rare violation of this mutually assured destruction pact came after Watergate, when everybody and their brother tried to identify the original Deep Throat, Bob Woodward’s secret source in All the President’s Men. Once in the early 1980s, when Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen came close to correctly naming Mark Felt as the mysterious source, Woodward did everything he could do to wave him off. “It’s not him, I said, adopting the well-tested Watergate strategy that when all else fails, lie,” Woodward confesses in his 2005 book, The Secret Man. “Cohen didn’t do the column.”\n\nThe New York Times did the right thing in publishing Anonymous because the “first duty of the press “is to obtain the correct intelligence of the events of the time, and instantly, by disclosing them, to make them the common property of the nation.” But having posited the ongoing conspiracy against the president, he can’t expect the press—maybe not even reporters on the news side of the New York Times—to protect his identity. He’s not an anonymous source for a journalist; he’s an anonymous author publishing his work.\n\nThis puts him in a separate, more vulnerable category. He’s less like Deep Throat and more like journalist Joe Klein, the anonymous author of the best-selling novel Primary Colors, or Michael Scheuer, the CIA officer turned anonymous author of 2003’s Through Our Enemies’ Eyes and 2004’s Imperial Hubris. Journalists suffered no compunctions about revealing the identities of both authors, and they will work as hard as Trump to uncover him. Don’t feel bad for Anonymous: In Washington, such acts of subterfuge are automatically rewarded with big book contracts.\n\nTrump’s response to the op-ed was predictably loopy, helping to make its case that the president wallows in a world of delusion. He rushed onto TV to recite the economic accomplishments of his administration and denounce the New York Times and other outlets as “phony.” Somewhere, the Resistance that Anonymous helps lead was busy sharpening its pencils and shredding documents they don’t want the president to sign.

First, what is and is not forgivable?... https://t.co/NQQpoO9kPa — Sterling K Brown (@SterlingKBrown) September 9, 2018\n\nThe actor’s words concern the objections Munn raised about the hiring of Steven Wilder Striegel to appear in a scene in the film. Striegel is a registered sex offender and served six months in prison after pleading guilty to allegations that he exchanged inappropriate emails with a 14-year-old girl.\n\nMunn insisted his scene be cut for the film, saying that neither she nor her castmates were told about Striegel’s criminal background. The scene was cut. But Munn told Vanity Fair that the backlash she’s gotten for being vocal about Striegel has made her “kind of feel like I’m the one going to jail.”\n\n“I didn’t go to jail, I didn’t put this guy on our set. I had this scene deleted. Thank God, honestly, that there is social media. It’s the fans and news outlets that’s confirming it to me that what I did was the right thing,” she told the publication.\n\n“If I didn’t have that feedback, I’d kind of go a little crazy thinking, ‘Why am I being treated like this?’ That’s not OK, to feel like the bad guy.”\n\nMunn’s co-stars Boyd Holbrook, Thomas Jane, Trevante Rhodes, and Keegan- Michael Key had declined to give public statements addressing Striegel controversy. The actress told Vanity Fair that one co-star even left an interview when the topic came up.\n\nDirector Shane Black was aware of Striegel’s crime, but last week said he only recently learned new details about it. “It has sadly become clear to me that I was misled by a friend I really wanted to believe was telling me the truth when he described the circumstances of his conviction,” Black said in a statement. “I believe strongly in giving people second chances ― but sometimes you discover that chance is not as warranted as you may have hoped.”\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter’s Video Lounge at the Toronto International Film Festival on Saturday, Munn sat alongside just one fellow castmate ― 11-year-old Jacob Tremblay ― and talked about how “lonely” it is to have been the one to say something about Striegel.\n\nRich Polk via Getty Images\n\n“I do feel like I’ve been treated by some people like I’m the one who went to jail or I’m the one who put this guy on our set,” Munn said.\n\n“When I’m being asked about it, I don’t know how to lie about it. … It’s a very lonely feeling to be sitting here by myself when I should be here with the rest of the cast.”\n\nBrown’s tweets in support of Munn addressed the idea of redemption in the age of the Me Too movement and also the importance of directors providing their cast with necessary information.\n\n“We all have the right to know who we’re working with! And when someone has been convicted of a crime of a sexual nature involving a child, we have the right to say it’s not okay! Our studio was not given that opportunity, and neither was our cast,” Brown said.\n\n“Especially [Olivia Munn] who was the only member of the principal cast who had to work with him. I so appreciate that you ‘didn’t leave well enough alone,’ & again, I’m sorry you feel isolated in taking action.”\n\nOur studio was not given that opportunity, and neither was our cast. Especially @oliviamunn who was the only member of the principal cast who had to work with him. I so appreciate that you “didn’t leave well enough alone,” & again, I’m sorry you feel isolated in taking action. — Sterling K Brown (@SterlingKBrown) September 9, 2018\n\nBrown then thanked the studio for cutting the scene and told Munn: “I hope you don’t feel quite so alone. You did the right thing.”\n\nKey’s representative responded to the controversy in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday, defending the actor’s absence from the discussion with Munn and Tremblay: “His last interview was scheduled after lunch, which he completed. He was always departing (the festival) early so he could be home to spend the Jewish holiday with his wife. Furthermore, Keegan reached out to Olivia privately last week to let her know how proud he was of her and echoed that sentiment in many interviews since then.”\n\nMunn doubled down her beliefs on social media, tweeting on Thursday, “The #MeToo movement called out abusers. But they’re not the only ones in the wrong.”\n\nThe #MeToo movement called out abusers. But they’re not the only ones in the wrong. Those who know about abuse and not only do nothing but continue to put abusers in positions of power are complicit. https://t.co/QngLCk9fzj — om (@oliviamunn) September 6, 2018\n\nMunn tweeted that the only reason she’s still doing press for the film is that she’s “contractually obligated.”\n\n“From what I’m experiencing, I think they’d prefer I not show up. It would make everyone breathe easier. Also, I worked really hard on this film, as did the rest of the cast and crew. Now that the scene is deleted I think audiences will love it.”\n\nMunn also tweeted that her mother taught her to stand up and say ”‘That’s not okay’ Even if you find yourself standing alone, speak up.”", "clickbait": null}

But Democratic super PACs are playing a bigger role than ever in the party.\n\nThe super PACs charged with helping Democrats take back the House and Senate are raking in record sums from donors motivated by opposition to President Donald Trump, even as a rising class of candidates — like Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke and Ayanna Pressley, who scored a primary upset over Rep. Mike Capuano in Massachusetts last week — are rejecting corporate PAC money and using campaign finance as a purity test against entrenched opponents. Meanwhile, the Democratic super PACs are using their new cash reserves to take over more and more of the party’s core functions, expanding from a focus on TV advertising to run major field programs and digital campaigns.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe current system has created an ongoing, awkward dance in which Democratic candidates are calling for change while benefiting from an increasingly large flow of outside money seeking to match Republican spending. In the recent special election in Ohio’s 12th District, Democrat Danny O’Connor rejected taking money from corporate PACs and pledged to change campaign finance laws if elected — as he benefited from more than a million dollars in outside spending praising him or attacking his opponent.\n\nDemocratic operatives have concluded their super PAC buildup is necessary, especially after searching for new strategies in the wake of the 2016 loss.\n\n\"For the last cycle leading into [this] election, every day is Groundhog Day, reliving a very tough election night,” said J.B. Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC, the main super PAC aligned with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “I experienced every meeting with activists, with organizers, with donors as the same conversation. Everybody wants to know how to do it different. People are eager to succeed.”\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAltogether, the four biggest Democratic super PACs have disclosed raising close to $150 million so far during the election cycle — more than double the $60 million the same groups had raised at approximately this point during the last midterm elections. Affiliated nonprofits have meanwhile raised tens of millions more from secret donors riled by Trump’s presidency.\n\nThose funds are going towards a range of new strategic investments that, super PAC operators like Poersch hope, will help Democrats win back the House and Senate. Majority Forward — the 501(c)(4) nonprofit linked to Senate Majority PAC — is spending $20 million to turn out voters in traditionally red states like Tennessee ahead of the midterms this year, while Priorities USA, the formerly presidential-focused group that went dormant during the last midterm election, has a 40-person digital advertising program ahead.\n\n“There is a lot of friendly competition to be relevant by providing more services than just carpet-bombing your opponent by television,” said one Democratic consultant who works on congressional races. “It’s not in vogue to say to your billionaire potential donor, ‘I’m going to beat the shit out of Republicans with the money you give me.’”\n\nNo pivot was bigger than the one performed by Priorities USA, the main super PAC that supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and former President Barack Obama in 2012. After watching Democrats be outspent 20-to-1 on digital advertising during the 2016 election, Priorities decided to become a year-round effort and focus on closing the gap, instead of following its post-2012 plan of shutting down between presidential elections.\n\n“Unlike the other side, the left does not have a history of consistent structural PACs or (c)(4)s, outside of issue PACs and candidate PACs. … We have not typically invested in PACs just as a part of the liberal-progressive structure,” Priorities USA President Guy Cecil said during a recent interview. “Essentially, that’s why we chose to exist.”\n\nPriorities USA, which in the past raised almost no money during midterm election years, plans to spend $75 million this cycle, according to Cecil. It currently employs 80 staff — quadruple the 20 individuals who worked at Priorities USA during the 2016 election — a reflection of how the organization operates more and more like a permanent party committee.\n\nAmerican Bridge, the Democratic opposition research hub, has also raised more money than in past years and built out new capacity by adding a team devoted to tracking governors races. The group now has more than 90 paid staff on board in September — more than the 80-plus people it employed at the height of the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nSome Republican super PACs such as those operated by the Koch network, which includes year-round field canvassers in 36 states, have been operating with permanent super PAC structures for years.\n\nAs Priorities USA and other super PACs have put down deeper roots, progressive politicians, many of them first-time candidates for office, have begun rejecting corporate PAC money and pledging to get money out of politics en masse. To date, 111 candidates running for federal office have taken an anti-corporate PAC pledge and advanced to the general election, including more than half of the DCCC’s “Red to Blue” list who are seeking to unseat congressional Republicans, according to the pro-reform PAC End Citizens United. In 2016, only three candidates on the list had taken the pledge.\n\nThe message has emerged as a central part of some candidates’ platforms and even in television ads.\n\n“Politicians like Dan Donovan sell out to corporate PACs, and we can’t get anything done,” says Democrat Max Rose, who is challenging New York Rep. Dan Donovan, in a recent ad. “I’ve got a message for the lobbyists and the corporate kingmakers: keep your damn money, because it’s not you I’m working for.”\n\nPressley, who defeated incumbent Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) in a primary challenge from the left in early September, used the issue to differentiate herself in a race between two progressive candidates.\n\nCandidates like Pressley running strong pro-reform platforms will arrive in Washington with a mandate from their supporters to pass campaign finance reform, said Adam Bozzi, spokesperson for End Citizens United. ECU hopes that such a surge will reinvigorate longstanding interest in changing campaign finance laws in the Democratic Party and put government and ethics reform at the top of Democrats’ list of priorities if the party reclaims either chamber on Election Day.\n\n“They’re not going to come to Washington to get bullied,” said Bozzi. “When they get here, it’s going to be easier for them to change the system because of the way they ran their campaigns.\"", "clickbait": null}

Courtesy @astro_ricky/NASA/Handout via REUTERS\n\nShares of roofing and insulation products companies including Beacon Roofing Supply Inc (BECN.O) and Owens Corning (OC.N) rose, while insurers such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N) tumbled.\n\nFlorence, the first major hurricane to threaten the eastern United States this year, was forecast to hit the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina on Thursday. North Carolina ordered residents to evacuate the state’s Outer Banks barrier islands, and the governors of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared states of emergency.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season, which typically runs from June to November, caused more than $250 billion worth of damage in the United States in 2017.\n\nBut several industries benefited. Car rental and hotel companies saw an influx of customers, while freight companies commanded higher prices as capacity tightened due to increased demand for supplies in areas struck by hurricanes.\n\nHere is a summary of how shares are performing as Hurricane Florence approaches:\n\nBUILDING SUPPLIES\n\nHurricane Florence had a mixed effect on building products companies. Shares of roofing and insulation companies climbed, while those of cement companies fell.\n\nOn Monday, shares of Beacon Roofing rose 8.2 percent, their biggest one-day percentage jump in more than a year. Owens Corning shares rose 3.7 percent and were the top gainers on the PHLX Housing Index .HGX.\n\nShares of generator maker Generac Holdings Inc (GNRC.N) also touched a four-year high and were last up 5.6 percent.\n\nBut Summit Materials Inc (SUM.N) shares fell 8.1 percent after the cement and concrete supplier warned of adverse weather, including Hurricane Florence, hurting performance in several of its markets. The shares of peer companies Martin Marietta Materials Inc (MLM.N), Vulcan Materials Co (VMC.N) and Eagle Materials Inc (EXP.N) also declined between 2 percent and 3.5 percent.\n\nHOME IMPROVEMENT\n\nShares of Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N) and Home Depot hit record highs on Monday. Lowe’s shares were last trading 2.2 percent higher, while Home Depot shares were up 2.6 percent.\n\nDuring the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Home Depot shares rose 16.3 percent. But Lowe’s shares only rose 4.7 percent during that period, lagging the S&P 500, as the chain struggled to compete with Home Depot.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nAllstate shares fell 1.9 percent on Monday. The insurer had a 10.5 percent market share in South Carolina and a 6.6 percent market share in North Carolina, according to Sandler O’Neill.\n\nShares of Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N), Progressive Corp (PGR.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N) declined between 1 percent and 2 percent.\n\nCAR RENTAL\n\nShares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc (HTZ.N) and Avis Budget Group Inc (CAR.O) surged during much of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season on investors’ anticipation of increased demand. Hertz shares climbed 156.2 percent between June and early November, while Avis shares rose 80.1 percent.\n\nOn Monday, Hertz shares rose 4.4 percent and Avis shares added 2.7 percent.\n\nFREIGHT\n\nIn 2017 between June 1 and Dec. 1, shares of USA Truck Inc (USAK.O) soared 172.9 percent, while shares of XPO Logistics Inc (XPO.N) and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL.O) climbed more than 40 percent. J B Hunt Transport Services (JBHT.O) shares rose 26.7 percent over the same period.\n\nOn Monday, XPO Logistics shares rose 5.4 percent. USA Truck shares advanced 3.8 percent, J B Hunt gained 3.7 percent and Old Dominion added 1.6 percent.\n\nHOTELS\n\nShares of hotel operators were little changed on Monday. They had gained during the 2017 hurricane season as demand from guests displaced by hurricanes outweighed the hit from storm damage.\n\nFrom June 1 to Dec. 1, 2017, shares of Hyatt Hotels Corp (H.N) jumped 25.8 percent. Shares of Marriott International Inc (MAR.O), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) and Choice Hotels International Inc (CHH.N) rose up to 18.9 percent.", "clickbait": null}

This latest flight, Fear: Trump in the White House, finds President Donald Trump lurching and floundering in agony over the legal pains the Russia investigation have inflicted upon his administration, and it fully explains why Trump’s lawyers have avoided exposing him to the interrogatory requested by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nOn the afternoon of Jan. 27, 2018, Woodward writes, Trump and his attorney, John M. Dowd, met in the White House residence. Seated with the president “at a table with a view of the Washington and Jefferson Memorials,” Dowd proposed a practice run-through of the interview that Mueller had requested—and continues to request to this day.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“I would just like to give you sort of a feel of what testimony could be like,” Dowd said to Trump, a man who has submitted himself over his long and litigious life to dozens of depositions. One of the most memorable, and damning for Trump, is the one he gave during his 2006 libel suit against biographer Timothy O’Brien. As O’Brien wrote in Bloomberg in January, “Trump ultimately had to admit 30 times that he had lied over the years about all sorts of stuff: how much of a big Manhattan real estate project he owned; the price of one of his golf club memberships; the size of the Trump Organization; his wealth; his speaking fees; how many condos he had sold; his debts, and whether he borrowed money from his family to avoid going personally bankrupt. He also lied during the deposition about his business dealings with career criminals.”\n\nThe mock interview with Dowd showed that Trump had not done much since then to improve his testimony game. For one thing, Trump couldn’t remember anything. “I’m not sure,” Trump said to one question about Michael Flynn. “I don’t know,” he said to another. “I don’t know. I can’t remember,” he said to another question. To another query, “Trump said he couldn’t remember.” “You know, I don’t know,” he said to still another as if his memory banks had been degaussed.\n\nBut that wasn’t the worst of it. Actually, Trump could remember some things, and on those select things, he claimed perfect recall.\n\n“Why did you tell Director Comey that—you kind of asked him to take it easy on Flynn,” Dowd said to Trump.\n\n“I didn’t say that,” the president protested. “John, I absolutely didn’t say that.”\n\nWhen Dowd pressed him, Trump did what he does when not blinded by memory’s fog or all-seeing: He detonated into a Yosemite Sam-style rant, calling Comey a crook and a liar in his well-practiced critique. After a brief interval, Trump promptly returned to yowl-mode, rendering the next 30 minutes useless, housefly Woodward writes. “It was quite a sight seeing the president of the United States fuming like some aggrieved Shakespearean king,” Woodward continues. “Trump finally came down from the ceiling and began to regain composure,” and Dowd explained, tactfully, that his mercurial nature meant he couldn’t possibly testify.\n\n“I’ll be a real good witness,” Trump later told Dowd, but Dowd gave it to him unvarnished. “You are not a good witness.”\n\nWoodward’s account and the scathing op-ed by Anonymous published this week in the New York Times confirms everything we’ve learned about Trump’s relationship with the truth. In the president’s version, he’s never at fault; he’s the victim. He’s reckless and ill-informed, as Anonymous put it, a flip-flopper extraordinaire. “Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails,” Anonymous wrote, echoing Dowd’s mock-testimony session.\n\nTo be a good witness, you must remain consistent, but that skill is not in Trump’s tool bag. In fact, he has made an art of self-contradiction. This week, one of his first responses to the Anonymous piece was to call it phony. But inside the same tweet, he demanded that the New York Times surrender the author’s identity to him “for National Security purposes.” On Friday, he called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the identity of Anonymous, although no law had been broken, and for a lie-detector test to be administered to those suspected of writing the op-ed. He also claimed he was contemplating action against the New York Times, but didn’t say what sort of action. Trump also tweeted that “the Woodward book is a scam,” and that he doesn’t talk the way he was quoted. New York Times reporters Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman quickly proved his claim about the way he talks to be false, showing that he has used phrases like “dumb Southerner” and “retard” before.\n\nTrump’s current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, fully understands Trump’s unique relationship with the truth, which is why he keeps filibustering the question of a Mueller interview. One minute he tells the Associated Press the president wouldn’t answer Mueller’s obstruction of justice questions, the next moment he tells NBC News those questions are “not ruled in or out.” Because Mueller and his people don’t talk to the press, Giuliani is essentially playing tennis against the wall, hitting the ball ever harder and claiming every line call in his favor.\n\nAs Axios reported this week, Giuliani is essentially daring Mueller to subpoena the president, gambling that the special counsel doesn’t possess the moxie to fight the legal question of whether a president can be forced to give testimony. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that President Richard Nixon had to give up White House recordings and documents, but has never ruled on whether a president must testify. On Friday, the Giuliani hijinks continued, as he demanded to see a draft of Mueller’s report before it’s released so his team can rebut it contemporaneously. Some legal authorities interviewed by Business Insider essentially said, Nice try, Rudy, explaining that the report’s future is really up to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller. “Expect the Mueller report to be buttoned down and based on provable facts,” Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor told Business Insider. “Expect the White House response to be anything but that.”\n\nWoodward morphs from housefly to stinging horse-fly in the last paragraph of Fear as he offers Dowd’s final assessment of the president. “Trump had one overriding problem that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president: ‘You’re a fucking liar.’”\n\n******\n\n“The reason I talk to myself is because I’m the only one whose answers I accept,” George Carlin once said.

There are currently 206 seats where Democrats have the advantage, compared to 205 for Republicans. But more of Democrats’ seats are safely in their column when compared to Republicans, and national trends suggest the wind is at Democrats’ back.\n\nFor POLITICO’s race ratings, each of the 435 House elections, 36 Senate contests — and 36 governor’s races, too — is rated on a 7-point scale: Solid Democratic, Likely Democratic, Lean Democratic, Toss-Up, Lean Republican, Likely Republican and Solid Republican.\n\nHouse\n\nThe election cycle began with Republicans holding key structural assets in the battle for House control. But over the course of the past year-and-a-half, those advantages have gradually eroded.\n\nRepublicans started with a number of entrenched incumbents in seats that swung against the GOP in last year’s presidential election. The problem? Many of them — like Ed Royce and Darrell Issa in Southern California, Rodney Frelinghuysen in New Jersey, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in South Florida and Dave Reichert in Washington state — chose to retire rather than run for reelection. Since incumbent members typically have more campaign cash in the bank and run stronger than candidates in open seats, it provided Democrats with a more even playing field than they might have otherwise had.\n\nAll told, more than 40 House Republicans aren’t seeking reelection, and Democrats already have the advantage in a number of these seats, including those currently held by Issa, Frelinghuysen, Ros-Lehtinen and Reichert.\n\nMany of the GOP incumbents who are running have their own problems. Fifty-six Republican incumbents were outraised by the Democratic challengers in the most recent fundraising quarter, and 16 of them trailed in cash on hand as of the end of June. One reason is that Democrats have been able to raise funds at a greater clip than past minority parties, in large part thanks to an unprecedented online fundraising network. Republicans are in better shape when it comes to outside money — Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading pro-GOP super PAC — had $73.3 million in cash on hand as of mid-July, its latest report with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nDemocrats also managed to chip away at another House GOP firewall: the maps under which the elections will be held. Nowhere is that more obvious than Pennsylvania: Republicans held a 13-to-5 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation at the beginning of 2017, but thanks to court-ordered redrawing of the districts, Democrats could capture a majority of the state’s House seats this November.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Trump — his average approval rating is down to 42 percent — and the GOP are near-toxic at a national level. Democrats’ lead on the generic ballot, on average, is in the high-single digits.\n\nAll the math — national and at the district level — boils down to this: Roughly half of the seats Democrats need to pick up are already leaning in their column.\n\nFour seats currently in GOP hands are even classified as Safe or Likely Democratic — New Jersey’s 2nd District and Pennsylvania’s 5th, 6th and 17th districts. In New Jersey, national Republicans have cut loose the party’s nominee, Seth Grossman, over bigoted statements Grossman has made in the past. Pennsylvania’s 5th and 6th districts are poised to move into the Democratic column as a result of new, favorable district lines. In Pennsylvania’s 17th District, Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb has a consistent lead over GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus in a member-vs.-member contest.\n\nDemocrats have another 10 Republican seats leaning in their direction — their candidates are currently favored, though not assured of victory. Four GOP incumbents are at least slight underdogs: Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia, Steve Knight in Southern California, Rod Blum in Eastern Iowa, Andy Barr in Kentucky. And Democrats are also favored to pick up seats where incumbents are retiring: Issa’s San Diego-area seat, Ros-Lehtinen’s Miami seat, Reichert’s Washington state seat, and a seat in southern North Carolina, where GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger lost his primary.\n\nOf the two-dozen seats rated as Toss-Ups, 23 are currently held by Republicans; just one, the southern Minnesota seat Rep. Tim Walz is vacating to run for governor, is held by a Democrat.\n\nSimilarly, of the 27 seats rated as Lean Republican, 26 are currently held by the GOP. Republicans’ best pick-up opportunity: the Minnesota Iron Range seat being vacated by retiring Rep. Rick Nolan.\n\nThere are some self-inflicted wounds for Republicans on the House map. Blum, whose seat is rated Lean Democratic, is facing an investigation by the House ethics committee. Virginia Rep. Scott Taylor’s campaign is under investigation for allegedly forging signatures on the qualification papers of an independent candidate that could siphon votes away from Elaine Luria, the Democratic nominee.\n\nTwo GOP incumbents are under federal indictments: New York Rep. Chris Collins and California Rep. Duncan Hunter. Republicans are trying to replace Collins — who said he doesn’t want to run again, even though he is the GOP nominee — on the ballot, but Democrats have promised to fight his removal. Hunter, meanwhile, is full-steam-ahead on his reelection bid in what would have otherwise been a safe GOP district.\n\nAll is not lost for Republicans: Some of their incumbents are in better-than-expected shape, given the Democratic lean of their districts. Reps. Carlos Curbelo (Florida), Will Hurd (Texas) and John Katko (New York) are favored to win reelection.\n\nDemocrats will make gains on Election Day, and a “wave election” is possible — though not yet guaranteed. An improvement in the national environment — combined with GOP outside groups’ hand-to-hand combat in some of these districts — can still result in Republicans’ saving their House majority.\n\nWith two months to go until Election Day, the House is rated as Lean Democratic.\n\nSenate\n\nRepublicans control 51 of the chamber’s 100 seats — or at least they will when former Sen. Jon Kyl takes the seat of late Arizona Sen. John McCain — and Democrats would need to net two seats in order to win back control. (Because Vice President Mike Pence breaks any ties in the chamber, a 50-50 Senate would still be controlled by Republicans.)\n\nThere are far more GOP opportunities on the board than chances for Democrats to pick up seats. Ten Democratic incumbents are seeking reelection in states Trump carried in 2016, while only Nevada Sen. Dean Heller is protecting a GOP-held seat in a Clinton state.\n\nOf the Democrats, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is the most vulnerable. Trump carried the state by 36 percentage points in 2016, and Republicans are confident Rep. Kevin Cramer will defeat her this fall. North Dakota is rated as Lean Republican.\n\nThe GOP also likes its chances to topple Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. Trump carried both states by just under 20 points. An NBC News/Marist poll out this week showed McCaskill deadlocked with her GOP challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley. Both races are rated as Toss Ups.\n\nThe Florida Senate race — which pits Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson against GOP Gov. Rick Scott — is also rated a Toss Up. As of early August, Scott had already spent $27.9 million on his campaign, and Democrats fear Nelson isn’t keeping pace. But Scott only won narrow victories in 2010 and 2014 — in great environments for Republicans — and the two candidates are still neck-and-neck, despite Scott’s early barrage.\n\nDemocrats are looking a little better in Montana and West Virginia — two other solid Trump states. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester is ahead of state Auditor Matt Rosendale, though Republicans hope Trump can help peel voters away from Tester.\n\nThat’s also true in West Virginia, where the president is expected to travel frequently before November. But Sen. Joe Manchin leads state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the latest polling. Both Montana and West Virginia are rated as Lean Democratic.\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s race against GOP state Sen. Leah Vukmir is rated as Lean Democratic, while three other Rust Belt Democrats are in the Likely Democratic column: Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Bob Casey (Pa.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio).\n\nAs for Democratic pick-up opportunities, two GOP-held seats are rated as Toss Ups: Arizona and Nevada. In Arizona — a state trending more Democratic over the past decade — the race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and GOP Rep. Martha McSally is likely to go down to the wire.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nevada, Heller has held his own with Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen thus far, polls show.\n\nTwo GOP-held seats are rated as Lean Republican: Tennessee, where popular former Gov. Phil Bredesen is running against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, and Texas, with Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s high-profile challenge of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBredesen is running roughly even with Blackburn in Tennessee, but Trump carried the state by 26 points in 2016. In Texas, Cruz is fully engaged and taking O’Rourke seriously.\n\nReclaiming the Senate requires Democrats to win all of the Toss Ups — and hold Heitkamp’s North Dakota seat. Or the party could lose North Dakota, but win all the Toss Ups and either Tennessee or Texas. Either way, it’s a tightrope walk at this point in the cycle. The Senate is rated as Likely Republican.\n\nGovernors\n\nDemocrats are likely to make gains in the number of governorships the party controls, a key pillar of the party’s plan to have more influence in policy-making — and the redrawing of political maps after the 2020 Census.\n\nTwo states that currently have GOP governors are now rated as Likely Democratic: Illinois and New Mexico. In Illinois, incumbent GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner is trailing Democrat J.B. Pritzker by a wide margin.\n\nThe race to replace Michigan GOP Gov. Rick Snyder is rated Lean Democratic: Gretchen Whitmer is a modest favorite over GOP state Attorney General Bill Schuette.\n\nOf the seven governors races in the Toss-Up column, all are in states currently helmed by Republicans: Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin. In Florida, a Quinnipiac University pol l out Tuesday gave Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the newly minted Democratic nominee, a slight advantage over Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn Wisconsin, two-term GOP Gov. Scott Walker is in the fight of his political life against state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers.\n\nRepublicans are looking a little stronger in five other races the party currently holds, which are rated as Lean Republican: Arizona, Kansas, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Vermont. The Alaska governor’s race is also rated as Lean Republican; the incumbent, Bill Walker, is an independent.\n\nThe GOP has a few pick-up opportunities from Democrats, though the Republican candidate is an underdog in all of them. Hawaii, Minnesota and Pennsylvania are rated Likely Democratic. Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon and Rhode Island are more winnable for Republicans, but each is rated Lean Democratic.\n\nTwo bright spots for Republicans: Massachusetts and Maryland. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker’s reelection effort is rated as Safe Republican, even in the bright-blue commonwealth. Meanwhile, the race in Maryland is rated Likely Republican, with Gov. Larry Hogan holding a big lead in the polls over Democratic nominee Ben Jealous.\n\nThe topline: Democrats are favored to pick up three governorships from Republicans, while the GOP could erase the only independent from the map. But the seven Toss-Up states are all held by Republicans, and a Democratic wave could flip those into the blue column.\n\n", "clickbait": null}

But the concerns over the bill are largely flowing from the Republican side, mainly from members fighting to keep hold of seats in suburban districts where President Donald Trump is most unpopular — and that are key to the GOP’s hopes of keeping their majority.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA dozen House Republicans, all but one of them from the high-tax states of California, New Jersey and New York, voted against the tax law in December because it capped state and local tax deductions, which they said would lead to tax increases on too many of their constituents.\n\nSome of those GOP lawmakers have openly said they would prefer to leave the tax issue alone as Congress also grapples with how to fund the government and the House potentially votes on health care measures that might be more politically beneficial to vulnerable incumbents. “If we were to pass that here in the House, it would be an exercise in futility, because it could never pass in the Senate,” Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey, who opposed the first bill, said Friday on CNBC.\n\nTop House leaders will unveil the second tax overhaul bill this week. Drafted by House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the bill proposes to make permanent individual tax rate cuts from the Republicans’ first tax bill, while introducing new measures intended to help families save money, especially for retirement, and to spur innovation for businesses.\n\nMorning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHouse leaders and White House officials hope it can at least pass through that chamber before the election. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill in 2018 given the focus on speeding through judicial nominations and a Supreme Court confirmation — and because Majority Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) simply does not have the votes to pass a second tax bill.\n\nRepublican leaders “certainly directed us from the get-go to be ready to move this in September,” Brady told reporters last week. “It’s full steam ahead.”\n\nGOP officials have long acknowledged that they couldn’t pack all of their priorities into a measure that eventually become last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, because no Democrats supported the bill. They passed it with a slim margin of votes using a budgetary measure called reconciliation, which required only a simple majority in the Senate, and have long wanted to revisit the bill’s tweaks to the individual side of the tax code. Those changes are scheduled to expire after 2025, while the corporate tax changes became permanent under the new law.\n\nThis time, the White House and Treasury Department largely have taken a back seat in drafting the bill, though Brady, President Donald Trump, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have remained in close touch as the bill progressed. Ways and Means lawmakers also visited the White House in July to discuss the bill, and the committee is expected to mark up the new measure on Thursday after releasing legislative text early this week.\n\nThe White House’s main concern is that the individual tax cuts are made permanent, said one Republican close to the White House, calling the other proposals more “nickel-and-dime” stuff. Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump also have visited Capitol Hill to discuss various parts of the bill, according to one administration official.\n\nShahira Knight, the relatively new White House director of legislative affairs, who helped write the Republicans' first tax bill in close concert with top economic staffers and lawmakers, will help shepherd this 2.0 bill through the House, in addition to tackling the farm and multiple spending bills. Since the first tax bill passed, one of Trump’s top informal economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, has become director of the National Economic Council, putting into the White House a firm champion of cutting taxes to spur economic growth.\n\nSome administration officials have expressed regret about the way the individual side of the tax code turned out under the Republican tax bill. “The part of tax reform to me that was so important was really the corporate side,” said Gary Cohn, the White House’s former top economic adviser, at a Washington event in June. “One thing that haunts me,” however, is that Republicans were not able to make the individual income-tax cuts permanent, he said.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the amount of stock buybacks that have followed the tax law and maintain the law has done little to help the average worker, and they are likely to pound those themes again when discussing the second bill.\n\nDemocrats might have run from that fight in the past, given how often Republicans label them tax hikers. But these days, they are more than happy to relitigate last year’s tax law, which they have insisted from the start would heap savings onto corporations and the wealthy while leaving behind the middle class.\n\nThe more even ground on taxes shows up in polling, too. The new tax law has not been the political plus that many Republicans expected as they try to hold on to the House, only becoming less popular since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe House Republican preview of the new bill also floated a range of new tools for families to increase savings, including creating a new Universal Savings Account and making it easier to contribute to Individual Retirement Accounts.\n\nLawmakers and aides in both parties say it’s possible that retirement provisions could pass as part of a year-end tax deal after the election. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel’s top Democrat, previously have teamed up on bipartisan retirement savings legislation.\n\n“My feeling is that it’s fine. It is certainly smart to make the tax cuts permanent, but it is not urgent, because those don’t expire for many years,” said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and informal economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign. “I would still support the bill because it is probably a good thing for Republicans to always be on the offensive on cutting taxes.”\n\n", "clickbait": null}

Although the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood, the PLO has maintained in Washington a general delegation office that facilitates Palestinian officials’ interactions with the U.S. government.\n\nThe head of the PLO delegation to the U.S. accused the Trump administration of “dismantling decades of U.S. vision and engagement in Palestine.”\n\n“Weaponizing humanitarian and developmental aid as political blackmail does not work,” Ambassador Husam Zomlot said.\n\nTrump has delivered a number of blows to the Palestinians during his time in office.\n\nMost recently his administration ended U.S. funding for the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees, slashing hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for projects in the West Bank and Gaza and cutting funding to hospitals in Jerusalem that serve Palestinians.\n\nTrump also recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the U.S. Embassy there, from Tel Aviv. Dozens of Palestinians were killed in protests that followed the move, and Palestinians have since rejected the U.S. as a peace broker.\n\nAlthough the Israelis and Palestinians are not engaged in active, direct negotiations, Trump’s administration has been working to mediate a peace deal that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior aide, White House officials have been preparing a peace proposal they intend to put forward at an unspecified time.\n\nTrump has promised to pursue the “ultimate deal” between the Palestinians and Israel.

The very idea of value neutrality that rose to prominence after World War II—the idea that individuals or institutions can fairly arbitrate among competing values in a pluralistic society—has fallen on hard times, leaving us unsure of where to turn for a reliable account of the world.\n\nIt’s easy to blame Donald Trump for this shift, with his casual mendacity and contempt for conventions. He has cavalierly trashed institutions he dislikes, from CNN to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to the intelligence agencies, as tools of the opposition, encouraging his followers to dismiss their pretenses of fairness. But Trump isn’t the root of this problem so much as a poisonous flower. The cynicism he exploits and deepens has been metastasizing for decades. Now it has reached stage 4.\n\nWe can already see the implications: dysfunctional Washington politics, a shrill public discourse rife with accusations of bad faith, conspiracy theories sprouting like toadstools, sharp hostility to universities. The inability to marshal a national consensus even on basic facts—like the Russian efforts to disrupt our elections—has prevented us from taking steps to secure our democracy and left many fearful about the soundness of our system. Without trust in the government and other neutral bodies to provide reliable information and to adjudicate fairly among viewpoints, we risk losing one of our democracy’s greatest virtues: the ability to wage our debates freely and contentiously while knowing that ultimately most of us will accept the resolutions as legitimate. Without such acceptance, self-government becomes like a trial without a judge, a boxing match without a referee. What happened?\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe importance we place on neutrality in our institutions is actually somewhat new. It grew out of what the intellectual historian Edward Purcell, in the title of an influential 1973 book, called the “crisis of democratic theory,” which gripped American intellectual culture in the 1920s and ’30s. In that era, worldwide depression and a backlash against the idealism of World War I undermined the grounds for believing that democracy was necessarily the best form of government. Because philosophers and social scientists had come to embrace empiricism over rationalism—arguing that our knowledge came from experience, not reason—many intellectuals had lost their confidence in the older philosophical principles that had once seemed absolute. A relativistic outlook seeped into American culture, even affecting how people thought about democracy.\n\nBut in the crucible of World War II and the fight against totalitarianism, Purcell showed, there emerged a revised defense of democracy. In place of the fashionable cynicism of the 1920s and ’30s came the idea that democracy was superior as a system of government precisely because it wasn’t absolute. It allowed multiple viewpoints to coexist and compete, and it was capable of revision. Although this argument took place at a rarefied level, among scholars and intellectuals, their ideas crept into popular thought.\n\nTrust In Institutions According to Gallup, Americans’ trust in institutions, from newspapers to the Supreme Court to public schools, has steadily declined, reaching historic lows over the past decade. The share with a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in Congress has dropped from a high of 42 percent when the survey was first conducted in 1973 to 11 percent in 2018.\n\nCredit: Getty Images\n\nThe new understanding of democracy as experimental, like science, meant government was best seen as a neutral manager of competing interests, not an instrument for imposing an ideology. A set of ideas might prevail in a given election, but victory was provisional. Democracy, one might say, was a verb; its value consisted in continuing to enact it. “The totalitarians regard the toleration of conflict as our central weakness,” Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote in 1949. “But we know it to be basically our central strength.”\n\nThe institutions that promote and disseminate knowledge came to rest on similar assumptions. In the late 19th century, America’s great research universities arose, and the social sciences flourished by claiming to put knowledge on a more scientific, empirical basis. Similarly, as early as the 1890s, newspaper journalism had come to value factual reporting over editorializing; by the 1920s, objectivity and commitment to facts were understood as helpful ways to avoid the pitfalls of the subjective. In the years after World War II, these tendencies settled into guiding principles. These institutions promoted inquiry, fairness, openness and the competition of ideas.\n\nThe post-war decades were hardly free of turmoil, from McCarthyism to the struggles for racial equality. But with the far right and far left in retreat, President John F. Kennedy could proclaim, as he did in 1962, that “the central domestic issues of our time … relate not to basic clashes of philosophy or ideology but to ways and means of reaching common goals—to research for sophisticated solutions to complex and obstinate issues.” Widely shared prosperity and a strong social consensus backing a liberal welfare state and an internationalist foreign policy helped Americans to trust in their political system.\n\nBy the late 1960s, however, the consensus that had prevailed was crumbling. Left and right alike made war on established authority. From both sides, one heard the same charge: that the ostensible neutrality of the government and other public institutions masked an ideology—one that was either aggressively liberal (according to the right) or cravenly conservative (according to the left).\n\nProfessional expertise came under fire. As Michael Schudson wrote in the book Discovering the News: “Critics claimed that urban planning created slums, that schools made people stupid, that medicine caused disease, that psychiatry invented mental illness, and that the courts promoted injustice.” Journalistic objectivity was now disdained not as an unattainable ideal, as it had been in the past, but as “a mystification,” in Schudson’s apt term. In academia, too, arguments against politicizing scholarship faced counterclaims that all scholarship was inherently politicized. Trust in government plummeted from its peak in the mid-1960s.\n\nEver since, intellectuals, journalists, civil servants and others have wrestled with questions of neutrality and bias. The awareness that scholars or judges might harbor a latent ideology didn’t, for the most part, keep them from aiming for objectivity. But in the academy—and in the wider culture—it fed the growth of what became known as postmodern thought. In journalism, dissatisfaction with the strictures of “straight news” encouraged a variety of innovations, including interpretive and analytical pieces, investigative reporting and the often-subjective New Journalism. Still, these early doubts about the professed neutrality of our knowledge-forming institutions did not fatally undermine them. Postmodern critiques of scholarly values were more often mocked than embraced. Objectivity remained a respected ideal.\n\nIt’s hard to say when the rejection of neutrality went from being a persistent intellectual critique to a dominant belief—or even whether it’s reached that point yet. But the battle in late 2000 over the outcome of the presidential election was a symbolic watershed. That the Supreme Court voted 5-4 along ideological lines to make George W. Bush president deepened the suspicion that not only ostensibly neutral election processes but even the law itself would succumb to the political preferences of those administering it. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens warned that “the loser” in that drama was “the Nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.”\n\nUnder Bush, the polarization that had already begun to seize Washington politics intensified, dealing body blows to neutrality. Since Richard Nixon’s presidency, Republicans had gradually built a conservative counterestablishment: think tanks, foundations, societies, networks and news outlets to promote their ideas. By Bush’s presidency, it was possible to find “experts” who could lend a patina of authority to conservative policy positions otherwise unsupported by solid research—whether on evolution, birth control, global warming or even the origins of the universe. Even Bush’s most controversial undertaking, the invasion of Iraq, relied on an alternative set of intelligence analysts, after those at the CIA and elsewhere failed to return the findings that Bush had hoped for.\n\nFox News was crucial to this development. Founded in 1996 by the longtime Republican consultant Roger Ailes, it gained influence in the Bush years—especially after the 9/11 terrorist attacks—and wooed viewers away from what were now being called the mainstream media. But Fox’s claim of being an ideological alternative to the networks was misleading. Those networks aspired to neutrality; they weren’t trying to advance liberal causes (even if some perceived bias in their reports). Fox, despite claiming to be “fair and balanced,” reflected the pronounced ideological agenda of the man who ran it—a thoroughgoing conservative cultural populist. So liberals began to emulate the right’s methods. MSNBC began to turn itself—if half-heartedly—into a liberal Fox. And if Air America tried (and failed) to be the mirror of Rush Limbaugh, many podcasts are now succeeding at the task.\n\nSo, too, with think tanks. Conservative shops like the Heritage Foundation might have fancied themselves right-wing counterweights to “liberal” ones like the Brookings Institution, but Brookings, like the network news shows, adhered to a neutral scholarly ideal. Lacking a Heritage of their own, Democrats in 2003 founded the Center for American Progress, with a pronounced partisan orientation. Now, key sources of information bear a partisan stamp, undermining their claims to independent authority.\n\n\n\n***\n\nUnder Trump, neutrality has become a difficult position for any individual or institution to maintain. Everyone is expected to take a side. Even attempts to articulate safe, bipartisan points of consensus run afoul of tribal suspicions. Journalists who serve up anodyne platitudes about a free press suddenly seem like militant anti-Trumpers, while commonsense pleas from no less than Barack Obama not to ignore someone’s ideas solely on the basis of his race or sex are mocked as wrongheaded or naive. Where the early internet, with its blogs and comments, had put pressure on the mainstream media, social media have amplified that pressure many times over—with Twitter enticing officially neutral reporters into staking out positions, voiced with sarcasm, snark or notes of partisanship that would be verboten in the news pages. No sooner does someone try to set up a new kind of neutral arbiter—like the invaluable fact-checking sites PolitiFact and FactCheck.org—than that, too, comes under fire for bias, as these sites have from the right. PolitiFact founder Bill Adair is trying to create an automated tool that conservatives will accept as neutral—though allegations that Facebook’s algorithms are politically skewed suggest that not even a computer program can attain that holy status anymore.\n\nOn campuses, departments now offer courses in “social justice,” which usually means the advocacy of left-wing politics, and university presidents feel pressure to take liberal political stands. Republicans no longer consider universities forces for good. In law, opposition is growing to widely respected concepts like viewpoint-neutrality—the idea that the government can’t punish speech based on its content. Even legal scholars on the left, as the New York Times’ Adam Liptak wrote, “have traded an absolutist commitment to free speech for one sensitive to the harms it can inflict.” The First Amendment, in some eyes, isn’t really neutral anymore.\n\nThe demise of neutrality lies behind the dominant political problems of our age. It is responsible for all the chatter about a “post-truth society” that we have heard lately. Truth still exists, of course, but agreement on the truth feels more elusive than it has in a long time. That spells danger for democracy, which depends on constructive argument and deliberation. Without trusted sources of information or respected vehicles of settling differences, there is only partisan argument and the triumph of the powerful.\n\nThe collapse of neutral institutions also feeds a vicious cycle of polarization and extremism. When institutions no longer enjoy credibility across the political spectrum, people look to more ideological sources for confirmation of what they want to believe. Conservatives drift toward the Tea Party and Trump, and progressives toward left-wing radicalism. Some long-standing neutral institutions, particularly in journalism, seem to be feeling pressure to abandon their historic role in order to please their audiences. If a reporter or scholar or judge isn’t anticipating good-faith critiques from a range of viewpoints, he is less likely to shore up his thinking to make his conclusions broadly palatable.\n\nWhen we anticipate the future, we usually project trends to continue—and that promises a long dark night of discord. But it’s also conceivable that the Trump presidency, with its ceaseless chaos and disruption, will prompt a recognition of what is being lost and fuel demand for a rebirth of statesmanship and objectivity. In the 1930s and ’40s, it wasn’t just the threat of totalitarianism but its lure—to those frustrated with the imperfections of democracy—that forced Americans to justify their democracy in more durable ways. The current crisis is forcing us to examine the intellectual and practical bases of our system. With luck, we will, in seeing its weaknesses, have the wisdom to figure out how to shore it up.\n\nLet’s just hope that this time, it won’t take a world war to change our minds.\n\nDavid Greenberg is a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers, and author of Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency.", "clickbait": null}

It’s a pilot project designed to demonstrate tiny homes, arranged in a community where rules are set by the residents themselves, should be part of the solution to combating homelessness in Denver.\n\nIt’s had its challenges. Two of the original residents returned to the streets after their neighbors asked them to leave for violating village rules. The village had to move about 200 feet in January — from one side of its lot to the other — at a cost of $25,000 because of now-changed city rules governing temporary residential structures. The city chipped in $10,000.\n\nBut Beloved has persevered. A year after opening, supporters are touting the results of a University of Denver study of the village as proof it is improving lives, both for its residents who were chronically homeless and in the surrounding community.\n\n“Unfortunately, the residents here have had to be the guinea pigs, but they have helped us sort out some of the issues that will help improve the model as we scale into the future,” Cole Chandler, a member of the Colorado Village Collaborative, said. “We intend to see dozens of these villages across the metro area.”\n\nThe study assessed the village from its opening on July 21, 2017, through April. Among the key findings:\n\nOf the 12 original village residents who participated in the study — one person declined — 10 remained housed through April. It goes beyond the scope of the study, but those 10 people are still in stable housing today, Chandler said,\n\nThree residents moved out of the village into housing of their own. Two of them, a couple, saved up for their own apartment, Chandler said. A third person was approved for Section 8 rental assistance.\n\nAnd all villagers — nine of whom were already working when they moved in — were either employed, in school or collecting disability, as of April. That fact also holds true today.\n\nTo read the full findings of the study, visit bartoninstitute.org/tiny-homes.\n\nThere were 5,317 people experiencing homelessness in Denver and seven surrounding counties in January, according to a point-in-time report compiled by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative. For Chandler, whose organization was created to help establish and support tiny home villages in Denver, the study demonstrates that more communities like Beloved should be built in the metro area and soon.\n\n“The idea was to build low-barrier housing for people with barriers to accessing the existing system” he said, noting each tiny home cost $22,000 to build. “With traditional housing-first scenarios, there are a lot of overhead costs with all of the support systems that they create, which are very helpful for a large portion of the population. We can do things at a lower cost.”\n\nThe study was performed by the DU’s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. It was commissioned by the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, also a part of DU. The institute has invested a combined $91,725in building and assessing the Beloved village and a proposed second village that Chandler’s group is seeking to build in Denver, director Rebecca Arno said.\n\nArno suspects the village’s self-governing model, with residents setting guidelines for behavior and other aspects of community life, has empowered the people living there.\n\nCersilla Wolf, one of the village’s charter members, has enrolled in college classes, opened an Etsy.com shop selling her own crocheted wares and began working at nearby Bigsby’s Folly Winery & Restaurant in RiNo, which reached out to the Colorado Village Collaborative about hiring a villager.\n\nWolf also has taken on the mantle of resident finder. She built a second, lofted bed into her home and brought in two other people struggling to find stable housing to live with her.\n\nFreddie Martin has been Wolf’s roommate since March after meeting her on the Metro State University campus. A history major who takes notes during village meetings to “create a historical record,” Martin said he hasn’t had a secure home in about a decade. He’s paid rent to live with friends but hasn’t been able to raise the money — including a security deposit and first and last month’s rent — to move out on his own. Now housed, he hopes to finish his degree in the fall.\n\n“This place has been a godsend,” Martin said.\n\nWolf’s first roommate, Kim Grier, lives next door now. The 27-year-old is trying to get a photography business off the ground while working at King Soopers.\n\n“When I got this house, this was the first place I ever had to live that wasn’t dependent on my emotional relationship with another person,” she said. “It’s a place that’s yours, where you can think.”\n\nThe DU study also examined the village’s impact on the surrounding neighborhood. Combining responses from a random sampling of nearby residents and a selective sampling of business owners, researchers found 78 percent of people in the area believe the village either didn’t hurt community safety or helped it — a perception supported by crime data.\n\n“Even the people who at the beginning of this process told me this will never work, this will be a disaster, have come back and said, ‘Wow, were we wrong,’ ” said RiNo Art District president Jamie Giellis. “It’s been awesome.”\n\nThe Village won’t be behind its colorful fence at 38th and Blake much longer. Chandler said an agreement is in place with a new property owner host, but he’s not ready to say where until more community outreach can be done. Colorado Village Collaborative hopes to raise $90,000 for a new commons building for the village when it does move, one with running water, three bathrooms and a full kitchen.\n\nUrban Land Conservancy, the nonprofit that owns the land Beloved sits on today, is moving forward with plans to develop the lot. The Walnut Street side will be turned into 66 affordable apartments in partnership with Medici Communities, conservancy president Aaron Miripol said. The Blake Street half will be sold to local developer McWhinney, which expects to build a 16-story mixed-use building that will also house Urban Land Conservancy’s office.\n\nColorado Village Collaborative was dealt a setback this month when Denver’s Landmark Preservation Commission voted that it could not proceed with building an eight-home women’s village on the property of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church at 2015 Glenarm Place because it didn’t fit with the surrounding historic district.\n\nThe vote was a temporary setback in Chandler’s view. He plans to meet next week with another property owner who he says has offered to host the women’s village for three years. He hopes to get it built before winter.\n\nMiripol, who has been involved with efforts to provide stable housing for people in need for decades, said he has been frustrated by the barriers that have cropped up and prevented the tiny home concept from growing in Denver and beyond. He hopes the results of the DU study will help turn the tide.\n\n“You can have a successful community like this. You can have an impact on people’s lives and you can do it in a way that is not harming the community, but in fact is very positive,” he said. “It’s important other folks step up and do this too.”", "clickbait": null}

Driscoll argued the videos countered the government's attempts to undermine the legitimacy of Butina and Erickson's relationship and, more broadly, her ties to the United States. Chutkan said the videos were not relevant to whether Butina should stay behind bars.\n\nChutkan did chastise prosecutors for making the “rather salacious” claim early in the case that Butina had offered sex for a job, only to walk it back later after Butina’s lawyers published the contents of the messages at issue and argued that they showed that Butina and a friend were joking. The judge said she was \"dismayed\" that the government concluded the texts were evidence of a serious offer to trade sex, noting it took her five minutes to read the messages and conclude they were joking.\n\n“It really makes it difficult to have a fair trial when those statements are made,” Chutkan said.\n\nThe judge didn’t penalize the government for what prosecutors said in court filings last week was an \"error.\" The judge commended them for coming clean.\n\nButina has been in custody since she was arrested on July 16. She has pleaded not guilty to charges that she acted as an illegal agent for Russia in the United States and conspired to do so. At a hearing on July 18, a federal magistrate judge agreed with prosecutors that Butina should be detained pending trial, finding there weren’t any release conditions that would satisfy the judge that Butina wouldn’t flee the country.\n\nOn Aug. 24, Butina’s lawyers filed papers asking Chutkan to reconsider pretrial detention, arguing prosecutors had relied “on innuendo and undefined phrases, soundbites and alarmist buzzwords.” Notwithstanding the “patina of espionage,” Butina wasn’t charged with spying, her lawyers wrote, saying the evidence showed Butina wasn’t trying to hide what she was doing in the United States. They argued there was no evidence that the Russian government paid her or covered her expenses, or was giving her directions on what to do.\n\nChutkan echoed a concern that prosecutors had raised in arguing to keep Butina detained, which is that if Butina got into a car with diplomatic license plates, US law enforcement could not stop the vehicle. There was nothing the court could do to stop Butina from getting into a diplomatic car and going straight to an airplane, Chutkan said. The judge noted that Russia doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States, and that the Russian government had been protesting Butina's detention.\n\nButina was in court on Monday, wearing a green prison uniform. She did not speak during the hearing.\n\nIn earlier court filings arguing to keep Butina behind bars, prosecutors claimed Butina had offered sex in exchange for a job, as part of a larger argument that her relationship with a US national wasn’t strong enough to ensure she’d stay in the United States; the US person wasn’t named in charging papers, but the description matches Erickson, a Republican operative from South Dakota and NRA activist, with whom Butina was living.\n\n\n\nThe government’s July filing didn’t include any other details to back up the claim, and Butina’s lawyers pushed back, saying prosecutors relied on a misinterpretation of text messages between Butina and a friend.\n\nThe government last week walked back from the allegation, saying in a Sept. 7 filing that even if they were “mistaken” about Butina offering sex for a position, there was still other evidence that Butina’s relationship with Erickson wasn’t strong enough to ensure she wouldn’t try to flee if released from custody.\n\nThe government also pointed out that Butina had offered to provide information about Erickson to the FBI. Butina’s lawyers countered that the government was trying to punish her for cooperating.\n\n“By extension, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia suggests that true love means never cooperating with federal investigations and that only a ‘duplicitous’ partner would offer an interview with government agents or provide truthful evidence. The government’s attempt to punish Maria for choosing to cooperate with a federal investigation — like a gang member would punish a witness for snitching — is jaw dropping,” Butina’s lawyers wrote in a Sept. 9 filing.\n\nThe government also asked the judge to enter an order restricting Butina’s lawyers from making public statements about the case. Driscoll has spoken to reporters on several occasions, and prosecutors argued those comments heightened the risk of prejudicing a future trial. Driscoll had offered opinions, revealed information that wasn’t included in charging papers, and accused prosecutors of sexism, prosecutors argued.\n\nDriscoll “has repeatedly sought to elicit the prejudices and sympathies of potential jurors, casting the defendant as a daughter and sister, and as a mere student or victim,” they wrote.\n\nButina’s lawyers argued that the government was trying to stop them from countering the prejudicial information included in the government’s filings, including information that prosecutors had walked back — the claim about Butina offering sex for a job — or admitted they got wrong. In a Sept. 7 filing, prosecutors acknowledged making a “error” in how they described a visa that Butina applied for, although they said the underlying argument they were trying to make — that her new visa would allow her to travel to and from the United States — was still correct, even if the visa type was different.\n\n“It is true that the case has garnered significant publicity. However, the government is largely to blame for this fact because of its efforts to ‘sex-up’ its thin case, which makes its request to restrain Maria Butina’s right to defend herself, her reputation, and to correct the false public record sowed by the government not only disingenuous but unconstitutional,” her lawyers wrote.\n\nIn agreeing to enter an order restricting what lawyers in the case can say in public, Chutkan pointed out that Washington, DC, has a relatively small pool of potential jurors, making it more likely that inappropriate comments about the case could make it harder to seat a jury and have a fair trial.\n\nThere is no trial date. Prosecutors are still turning over evidence to Butina's lawyers, and on Monday they asked for another 60 days before giving the court the next update on the status of the case. In the meantime, Butina's lawyer Alfred Carry told the judge that they plan to file a motion to dismiss the case — he said they'll argue that she's facing two criminal counts for what is essentially the same underlying crime of being involved in a conspiracy to act as an illegal agent for the Russian government. The next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 13.", "clickbait": null}

There are other screens at the defense and prosecutor’s tables. There are even more screens in the nearby attorney-client conference rooms.\n\nWhen the judge is on the bench for child support hearings, each one of those screens plays a Powerpoint presentation with a series of slides. Each slide has a different but similar message.\n\n\n\nHelp Wanted. Inquire Within. Come Join Our Team.\n\n\n\nThe job opportunities are plentiful if you know where to look.\n\n\n\n\n\n“They can’t come up here and tell me some story that they can’t find a job,” Judge Walther said. “Some of [the defendants] really do want to get jobs. Some of them don’t. Knowledge is power and I have the knowledge now that there are plenty of jobs out there.”\n\n\n\nThe idea was hatched a couple of weeks ago. Judge Walther heard the case of a man who was behind on his child support, the judge said. The defendant claimed he couldn’t pay the child support because he couldn’t find a job. Judge Walther then set out to find the evidence.\n\n\n\nWith a keen eye and his camera phone — along with the help of his wife — the judge began documenting every ‘help wanted’ or ‘now hiring’ sign he could find. Each sign he saw warranted a picture. It didn’t take long for one picture to evolve into a couple dozen. Within a few weeks time, he found more than 60 places looking to hire. Many of those places were looking to hire multiple employees.\n\n\n\nEventually, the judge compiled the photos and created the Powerpoint presentation. Each slide contains the picture of the ‘help wanted’ sign, in addition to the business’ address. Then, he played it in the courtroom.\n\n\n\n“Every single person in the courtroom was watching it,\" Judge Walther said.\n\n\n\nThe display certainly caught the attention of the defendants in his courtroom. Many of them knew the excuse no longer applied.\n\n\n\n“Some people, it is laziness. Some people just don’t want to work. Some people are afraid to make changes in their life,” Judge Walther said. “Maybe for some others, they don’t understand how easy the opportunity is. I’m here to spoon-feed it to them and say, ‘Here are all the opportunities. You don’t have to go anywhere else.’”\n\n\n\nThe job opportunities run the gamut. There are positions in fast food, retail, the building trades and everywhere in between. Judge Walther said the presentation and the message behind it also applies to those who are underemployed.\n\n\n\n“Working 15 to 20 hours a week, that’s not a job. That’s a hobby,” Judge Walther said. “I would certainly hope that this would inspire them. Some of them may feel like they were forced into it. But I’m okay with that. I don’t care what their motivation is.”\n\n\n\nAccording to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, there are 18,078 child support cases with past due balances in Lorain County. Those past due balances total $150,183,414.\n\n\n\nBy having some of those defendants who owe back child support begin chiseling away at their debts, Judge Walther hopes it can help solve even more problems.\n\n\n\n“If they are not paying their child support, there is a good chance that that child is being supported by government benefits. We can take a negative and turn it into a positive,” Judge Walther said.\n\n\n\nHis approach seems to be catching on. Many citizens around the county have started sending pictures and job opening information to Judge Walther’s office. Some of the staffing agencies around the county have also started reaching out. Judge Walther said he’s even kicking around the idea of possibly hosting a job fair featuring some of those employers. In the end, it all comes down to helping out the children in his county.\n\n\n\n“I think that somebody that has a job maybe has a bit more pride in themselves because they are taking care of themselves and their children,” Judge Walther said.", "clickbait": null}

Romans 5:8” or “You are cared for! 1 Peter 5:8,” a Valentine’s Day tradition her late mother passed on to her as a child.\n\n“I love my school, but I love freedom and God more,” Olsen said. “Being in America, everyone has the constitutional right to hand out Birthday cards, Christmas cards, invitations, notes, Valentines and whatever else they want that is under protected speech without getting approval. This freedom needs to be recognized not only at NWTC, but across the country.”\n\nTen minutes after Olsen started handing out “Jesus Loves You” Valentines for fellow students, friends, and faculty in the student center on campus, security was called to stop her. A security officer took Olsen to the security office and told her “she was not allowed to hand the valentines out because school policy prohibits it,” according to the security incident report filed on February 15.\n\nNWTC officials told Olsen she was violating the school’s public assembly policy, which sets a designated space for distribution of literature, picketing or displaying protest signs – otherwise known as a “free speech zone.”\n\n“The first time the school stopped me from handing them out was in 2014, and after several months…they finally agreed to change policy and educate their staff on students’ constitutional rights,” Olsen said, but when she was reviewing policy last October, she noticed nothing had changed.\n\n“I already tried the school’s way of doing things and they lied to me,” she said.\n\nBut NWTC spokeswoman, Karen Smits, told Fox News this incident is about “record privacy.”\n\n“The Bible theme had nothing to do with being stopped,” Smits said. “If she wanted to hand out baseball cards, it would be handled the same way. She was stopped because she was ‘going into areas unannounced and uninvited that are restricted to staff members and where students are not permitted to walk freely.’ She was stopped for disrupting a work area where she did not have business.”\n\nOlsen disagrees.\n\n“If that’s the case, the week before I should’ve had security called on me because I was in the same office…and they never said anything,” Olsen said.\n\nOlsen’s lawyer, Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty president and general counsel Rick Esenberg, said regardless of whether the school is motivated by the religious content, the policy is unconstitutional.\n\n“The problem is that speech was limited to a small zone,” Esenberg said. “A public university cannot put free speech in a box.”\n\nAdam B. Steinbaugh, director of the Individual Rights Defense Program for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, told Fox News the policy “impermissibly restricts” student’s free speech rights.\n\n“Even assuming the college is correct that she was in an impermissible area, it's not clear where she could go. If she wanted to use the 'public assembly area' she would have to get permission from security, and the college bans distribution of literature with 'offensive' content,” Steinbaugh said. “What's offensive is the notion that security guards, or any other government officials, have the right to grant or deny permission to hand out pamphlets – or Valentines.”\n\nOlsen said she hands out the hearts “because of the love that God has shown is why I show it to others. When I asked Jesus to be my Lord and Savior at 4 years old, I ran and told my mom, ‘I’ve got Jesus! I’ve got Jesus,’ and I wanted the world to know about this incredible free gift,” Olsen said, adding with laughter, “and I guess I haven’t stopped.”\n\nOlsen said she just wants the school’s policy to protect freedom of speech for all students on campus.", "clickbait": null}

(As) a veteran who has been struggling with this condition for a while – since 2004 – it is amazing to see and be part of the change in mental health for veterans and their families,” said Perez, who founded the Post Traumatic Art Foundation in Puerto Rico, which offers therapy through art and music to other veterans in the community.\n\n“We have over 150,000 veterans with just one VA in Puerto Rico.

The Walk of America expedition was inspired by the vision of U.K. Expedition Patron Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex.\n\nTheir 3-month tour of the United States took them through parts of California, Texas, Colorado, Ohio, Wyoming, Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, the nation’s capital and Pennsylvania before finishing up in New York City.\n\nAlong the way they met countless veterans, who also shared their stories of the struggles they face after returning from the battlefield.\n\n“I was wounded in 2006. I lost my right eye, I lost my partner (Dan) and Jessie our driver and it wasn’t until four years later that I was diagnosed with my minor brain injury, PTSD and depression,” U.S. Air Force Master sergeant Adele Loar, who also completed the incredible journey, told Fox News. “So throughout all the time, I was battling it on my own.”\n\n105-YEAR-OLD NAVY VETERAN FINALLY GETS HIS COLLEGE DIPLOMA AFTER 83 YEARS\n\nShe said it took her a long time to figure out why she never wanted to leave the house and why she was crying all the time – “I hated people who cried and I became one of them,” she recalled.\n\n“It wasn’t until two non-profit organizations helped me understand that it was OK that I survived because for eight years I was pissed I lived,” Loar said. “Every day I swore that if there was a God I would not wake up. (And now) to come back and raise awareness that it’s OK to seek help. We are losing too many of our friends.”\n\nLoar, the only woman on the Walk of America expedition, said one of her missions during the last three months was also to remind people that there were women in combat, many of whom also returned stateside suffering from the same mental health issues as their male counterparts.\n\n“It’s not even if we’re wounded. Sometimes people forget we’re in the military,” she said. “Even along this walk, people would come up to shake the hands of the guys and turn their back to me… It was important to show that we need the same help as our male counterparts and not forget that we exist.”\n\nFor the final walk on Thursday, the team – made up of Perez, Loar, U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Larry Hinkle, Royal Logistics Corps Kev Carr, Royal Signals Kemsley Whittlesea and Royal Anglian Jonny Burns – were joined by former Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden, who were representing the Biden Foundation.\n\n“This has been an inspiration. This has been a journey of courage, love and kindness and I am so proud to have played a small role,” Dr. Biden said during remarks at the Queen Elizabeth II Memorial Garden. “Today marks the end of this walk but the work must continue. We must all play a part in raising awareness of the mental health needs of services members, veterans and their families.”\n\nShe later told Fox News that these men and woman were such an inspiration to her and her family – much like her son, Beau, who joined the military in 2003 as a member of the Delaware Army National Guard. Beau died in 2015 at the age of 46 after battling brain cancer.\n\n“We saw his strength and his resilience. All these men and women are just like my son,” Dr. Biden said. “They possess strong characters. That resilience and that grit and courage and that’s who they are. They are sharing their stories and they are so brave.”\n\nMARINE VETERAN AMPUTEE REACHES SUMMIT OF MOUNT KILIMANJARO: ‘IT’S THE CLOSEST THING TO GETTING TO HEAVEN’\n\nKev Carr, who struggled with homelessness and contemplated suicide after he was discharged from the military 14 years ago, said Walking with the Wounded saved his life. He now lives in The Beacon, a specialized veterans’ center in Catterick Garrison that helps homeless veterans or those at risk of becoming homeless. Jonny Burns also lives there.\n\n“The things I was going through – I wouldn’t wish it on anybody, civilian or military or an enemy,” he told Fox News. “It was dark. I was in a dark place. I attempted suicide, but speaking out I’ve learned that, not only does it help me, it can help others.”\n\nThe former vice president added, “It takes courage to come out and say, ‘Look, I’m battling internally, emotional problems with having to deal with what I went through. Every city they went into, you can be certain as they walked, there was a wounded warrior who was thinking, ‘if they can do this, let the whole world see it, maybe I should say I need help. I need help with my demons.”\n\nEach member of the Walk of America expedition had their own journey and story of struggle and success to share with the world. For them it was more than just raising money for the charities, but to make sure that the many times forgotten heroes – men and women – who return from the battlefield are given the help they need.\n\n“We have spent lifetimes working together, fighting alongside each other and protecting each other,” Prince Harry said in a message to the group shared on their Facebook page after they completed their walk. “And it’s people like you that we can look at ways of recovering together.

Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill waging competitive re-election fights. In a two-way contest, Donnelly leads Republican Mike Braun 49% to 43% in the Hoosier State, while McCaskill and Josh Hawley are locked in a dead heat -- each with 47% -- in the Show Me State.\n\nAnother prime target for Republicans is Florida, where Quinnipiac University found Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott running even with 49% each after some $37 million in television ads -- roughly half of that by Scott's campaign.\n\nThe Blue Wall of Great Lakes states that Trump toppled in November 2016 so far looks to be holding for Democrats in 2018. Sens. Bob Casey (Pennsylvania), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Debbie Stabenow (Michigan) and Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) are all favorites for re-election. Of that group, Baldwin appears to have the toughest race, facing a challenge from conservative state Sen. Leah Vukmir.\n\nTo be sure, the deep red states where Democratic incumbents are hoping to hang on may play to type and keep the majority out of reach for the party. But if a blue wave crests higher than expected, it could lift Democrats in states that would be all but lost in a more neutral environment.\n\nDemocrats are on offense in Nevada, a state Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points and where Rep. Jacky Rosen is now challenging GOP Sen. Dean Heller. The Battle Born State could be ground zero for the health care debate this cycle, with Rosen aggressively attacking Heller's support for the GOP's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans breathed a sigh of relief late last month when GOP Rep. Martha McSally emerged from a tough primary contest in Arizona with a convincing victory against conservative firebrands Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. But McSally's shift to the right during the nominating fight, particularly on immigration, could pose a challenge in the general against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who entered the general election largely unscathed.\n\nThe list of Democratic targets this cycle has doubled, with a pair of red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- looking increasingly competitive. With the Senate currently split 51-49 in favor of Republicans, if Democrats were able to win either of those contests -- assuming they also flip Arizona and Nevada -- it would mean the party could afford to see one of its incumbents defeated and still preserve a path to the majority.\n\nTennessee Senate: Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up\n\nIn Tennessee, former two-term Gov. Phil Bredesen is running a methodical campaign against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn by focusing on local issues and emphasizing his own moderate brand of politics over that of the national Democratic Party. That strategy seems to be working to his point, with an NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showing Bredesen and Blackburn running neck and neck -- 48% to 46% -- among likely voters.\n\nBredesen's standing is buoyed by his popularity -- 61% of likely voters have a favorable view of the Democrat versus 22% who hold a negative view of him. By comparison, 46% of likely voters view Blackburn favorably compared with 36% who do not.\n\nWhen it comes to the President, 47% approve of his job performance while 43% disapprove. Blackburn, a staunch ally of the President, is making the argument that electing Bredesen could give Democrats control of the Senate -- a persuasive message in a state that went for Trump by 26 points. Bredesen has pledged to work with the President when he proposes policies that benefit Tennessee, declaring at the start of his campaign he was not \"running against\" Trump.\n\nTexas Senate: Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican\n\nRepublicans are sending the cavalry to Texas for Sen. Ted Cruz, with the President announcing he'll do an October rally for his former 2016 GOP primary rival, and the political arm of the Club for Growth launching a seven-figure television ad campaign to hammer Cruz's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke has been a fundraising phenom, more than doubling Cruz in the second quarter and leading the GOP incumbent in cash on hand by almost $5 million. Polls show O'Rourke within striking distance of Cruz. The latest NBC News/Marist survey showed the race at 49% to 45% in Cruz's favor.\n\nFor Democrats, the path to victory in the Lone Star State has been elusive. The party's last statewide win came in 1994. The last time Texas elected a Democrat to the Senate was 1988. Clinton lost the state by nine points -- an improvement on Mitt Romney's 16-point margin over Barack Obama in 2012. Having tapped into the Democrats' enthusiasm edge, O'Rourke appears poised to narrow the gap even more this year.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nWest Virginia should be at or near the top of the GOP's targets this cycle based on Trump's 42-point margin there in 2016. The President has also visited the Mountaineer State six times since taking office.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans is they are running against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a popular two-term governor who has demonstrated a willingness to buck his party and support the President's policies and nominees. He voted for Trump's first Supreme Court selection, Neil Gorsuch, and has signaled he's open to supporting Brett Kavanaugh, saying Wednesday he has not seen anything disqualifying from the nominee during this week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Manchin also has demonstrated he can win in a less-than-ideal environment, receiving 61% of the vote in 2012 even as Romney carried the state with 62% support.\n\nRepublican nominee Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general, has faced questions about his fundraising ability and Manchin has a six-to-one cash advantage. Morrisey only recently launched his first television ad, a biographical spot that features praise from the President and highlights his legal challenge to environmental regulations implemented by the Obama administration.\n\nThat comes after Democratic outside groups have spent the summer pummeling Morrisey on TV over his work as a \"DC lobbyist\" for pharmaceutical companies and his decision to join a lawsuit challenging the ACA, a move that could lead to protections for pre-existing conditions being struck down. That line of attack could resonate in West Virginia, which at 36% has the highest rate of adults under 65 with pre-existing conditions, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2016.\n\nNorth Dakota Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Republican\n\nOne state where Republicans are increasingly bullish about their chances is North Dakota, where GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a state the President carried by 36 points. Trump was personally involved in the effort to recruit Cramer into the race and stumped for the three-term GOP lawmaker Friday night in Fargo.\n\nFor a while it appeared Heitkamp was Trump's favorite Senate Democrat. The President praised her as a \"good woman\" during a September 2017 event in the Peace Garden State and invited her to the White House in May for the signing of a bank deregulation bill she co-sponsored.\n\nNow it seems the President is all-in for Cramer. \"You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota, but votes like they're from North Dakota. That's what you need, and that's Kevin Cramer,\" Trump said during a Fargo rally in late June.\n\nHeitkamp should be able to keep the race close because of her strong personal brand and resource advantage -- leading Cramer $5.2 to $2.4 million in cash on hand. Cramer's bottom line should get a boost thanks to the President's visit, which his campaign says raised over $1 million.\n\nDemocrats are attacking Cramer on health care, accusing him of voting to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and trade policy, a particularly acute concern in agriculture-rich North Dakota. Republicans, meanwhile, are targeting Heitkamp on hot-button issues such as abortion and so-called sanctuary cities, as well as her vote against the GOP tax cuts.\n\nGiven Trump's popularity in the state, Cramer's unwavering support for the President could be a more potent pitch to voters than Heitkamp's message of moderation. The national environment this year favors Democrats, but North Dakota is very much Trump country -- and Cramer is Trump's candidate.\n\nNew Jersey Senate: Race moves from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since New Jersey voters elected a Republican to the Senate.\n\nBob Hugin is a longshot to break that streak, but the pharmaceutical executive is giving Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez a serious challenge in the Garden State. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Hugin trailing Menendez by six points in a state Clinton won by 14 points in 2016 and Obama carried by 17 points four years earlier.\n\nThe federal corruption trial involving Menendez ended last November in a mistrial, but an ethical cloud continues to hang over the Democrat. Nearly half of New Jersey voters say Menendez was involved in serious wrongdoing, including 38% of Democrats.\n\nDemocratic primary voters in the state delivered a clear message to Menendez in June when little-known challenger Lisa McCormick drew 38% of the vote against the two-term incumbent. Still, Menendez received more votes than were cast in the GOP primary, which Hugin won with 75% support.\n\nHugin has loaned his campaign more than $15 million and has spent more than $7 million on television ads to boost his candidacy. Menendez has been saving his resources -- holding about $6.4 million cash on hand. He's also getting a little help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which recently teamed with Menendez on a joint television ad buy. Democrats feel confident Menendez's numbers will improve once he hits the airwaves. He also stands to benefit from several competitive House races in a state where Democrats have strong recruits.", "clickbait": null}

Bush, no friend to Trump, who will join Scott at two fundraisers for a super PAC backing Scott’s Senate campaign Friday. It’s the latest instance of the Florida governor visibly tying his political fortunes to a prominent Republican other than the current president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nScott — who was frequently by Trump’s side at the White House and at his resorts in Palm Beach and Bedminster, New Jersey, in 2017 — began putting more distance between himself and the unpopular president this year as he geared up for a Senate run that Trump himself had repeatedly urged him to make. Scott also chaired the super PAC backing Trump’s 2016 presidential bid.\n\nNow Scott seldom mentions the president and won’t commit to having an event with him specifically.\n\n“I want everybody that believes in what I'm going to do to come help me win,” Scott told a Tampa Bay Times reporter last week when asked if he would like having Trump campaign for him.\n\nScott made the remarks in advance of a fundraiser headlined for him by Vice President Mike Pence. Scott skipped a July 31 Trump rally for GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis’ campaign for governor. In April, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Cory Gardner, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, also fundraised for Scott .\n\nScott isn’t completely snubbing the president. He flew down from Washington on Air Force One to Tampa with Trump in July and then accompanied Trump to an official presidential visit to Tampa Technical High School — an event where their exposure to TV cameras was limited.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIn contrast to his closeness to Trump in 2017, Scott’s distance from the president this year as the midterm election comes into focus provides a glimpse into Trump’s standing in the nation’s largest swing state, which he won by just 1.2 percentage points.\n\nCompared to his underwater national polling average, Trump is more popular in Florida — but that’s not saying much. His net favorability rating is still a negative 4 points in Florida (and negative 16 points nationally) according to Quinnipiac University’s polling.\n\nQuinnipiac’s poll showed Scott is tied with Sen. Bill Nelson at 49 percent each.\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, has no choice but to stick by Trump, whose endorsement and full-throated support for the congressman helped him beat a once better-known and better-funded GOP rival, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.\n\n“Rick is doing what a sensible Republican should do — if he’s in a position to be able to do it, and Ron DeSantis isn’t in that position,” said a top Florida Republican who received the invite for the New Republican PAC events headlined by Bush. “This isn’t an F-you to Trump. But the president might see it as such.”\n\nIn a written statement, Scott’s campaign said the governor “is glad to accept the support of President Bush, Vice President Pence, and anyone who shares his views that we need to reform Washington. The governor appreciated the president endorsing his race when he came to Tampa in July.”\n\nAnother Republican familiar with the political operations of both Trump and Scott said it’s a “keep-away-from-Trump strategy. But Scott doesn’t want to be in-you-face about it. And you never know: He could announce a fundraiser tomorrow.”\n\nThe Friday fundraiser is separated into two parts: a 11:00 am private meeting at $25,000 a pop in Tampa and a reception in Palm Beach at 3:30 on the same day at $50,000 a pop.\n\nWith an eye on the November elections, Scott has also put modest distance between himself and the president in terms of criticizing Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policies that led to family separations at the border. Scott also moved more to the center by signing the first-ever gun control legislation passed in Tallahassee under Republican rule.\n\nThe Florida governor has long ties to Bush. Scott was once a minority partner with Bush in owning the Texas Rangers baseball team, which was sold to billionaire Tom Hicks, whose son and namesake is the chair of the New Republican PAC for which the president is fundraising.\n\nFew presidents know what it’s like to manage Florida Republicans during a midterm like Bush.\n\nIn 2002, Bush had no trouble at all attracting Republican support here and was sought-after as a surrogate as the country was united behind him after 9/11. His brother, Jeb, ran successfully that year for reelection to the second of his two terms.\n\nBut 2006 was another story. With the burden of the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina response weighing on the Bush presidency, Republican candidate for governor Charlie Crist skipped a Pensacola event with the president on the way to resounding win. Jeb Bush went in Crist’s place and wasn’t happy with Crist’s snub.\n\nAt the time, then-Senate candidate Katherine Harris was clamoring for help from Bush but the president, whose White House had expressed displeasure with Harris’s chaotic campaign and longshot chances, declined as she lost big to Sen. Nelson during his first reelection.\n\nNow Nelson, who has had relatively weak opponents, faces his toughest challenge ever from Scott.\n\nDaniel Strauss contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct McConnell's title.", "clickbait": null}

He’s stuck with a long incumbency, and he’s stuck with a short general election,” said Tom Russell, a Wisconsin-based consultant with the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nThe signs that Walker is ripe to be taken down are everywhere. His opponent, Schools Superintendent Tony Evers, has a slight lead in recent polls and there’s evidence that critical suburban voters are shifting leftward.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThree former Walker aides have even turned on the governor, with two cutting ads for Evers. And Walker has quickly gone negative on Evers, including in a new, highly-charged ad .\n\nJust as important, Democrats are running a populist candidate they believe is made for the moment — Evers, who built momentum from decisively winning a crowded primary and went on to raise $1 million in his first week as the nominee.\n\nA career educator, Evers presents a crisp contrast with Walker, who’s held elected office for more than two decades. Democrats have seized on a “Walker fatigue” message that blames him for a teacher shortage, deteriorating roads (“Scottholes” as one group calls them ) and rising health care costs.\n\nThe governor’s real soft spot in his bid for a third term, however, might be his 2016 run for president. His detractors hold it up as evidence that Walker is more concerned about his political ambition than the people of Wisconsin. TV ads are already panning Walker’s White House run, saying he can’t be trusted to stick around for a full four-year term.\n\nIt clearly hits a nerve with Walker.\n\nConcluding a statewide fly around in Waukesha on the first day of the general election campaign last month, Walker began moving away from a press scrum, taking no further questions. But when asked whether the people of Wisconsin could trust he was committed to a full term as governor, given his 2016 presidential run, Walker stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n“Tony Evers ran for superintendent for a four-year term and a year after, he’s running for governor. You ask him the same question?” Walker asked a reporter, pointing to the reporter’s voice recorder, then pressing: “That’s on the record, right? You’re going to ask him the same question?” (POLITICO later asked Evers’ campaign; the answer was “yes.”)\n\nWalker then responded directly about his intentions.\n\n“Of course, 100 percent. I’m running for governor, I’m going to be here for four years,” Walker said, noting he went on a statewide listening tour after he gave up his presidential ambitions. “I came back and did listening sessions in all 72 counties. It’s what influenced our budget, the changes we made in education … it all came out of us going right back to the roots.”\n\n“A lot of people have said I could have easily gone on and done something else. I could have joined the Cabinet, could have joined the public sector,” Walker said. “But instead, I’m committed to being governor.”\n\nFor all the storm clouds surrounding Walker’s prospects, few in either party are willing to write him off. As he runs for a third term, his job approval ratings remain in a fairly narrow band , never dropping too low or soaring too high.\n\nHe’s also cash-flush, given the $8.6 million Walker and the state party reported in the bank in July. On top of that, the Republican Governors Association is expected to invest $5.7 million in preserving Walker’s governorship. Walker can boast of a healthy state economy and an unemployment rate that stands at 2.9 percent — he paints Evers as beholden to unions and says an Evers victory would mean higher taxes and would stall that humming economy.\n\nWalker’s durability and resilience — he’s been running and winning tough elections since his early 20s — inspires confidence among Republicans. He’s the last man standing among a Wisconsin GOP triumvirate who ascended to national prominence in the Obama era only to see their fortunes sputter during the Trump presidency.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is not running for reelection; Reince Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chair, was ousted from his position as White House chief of staff after a chaotic six months.\n\n“I don’t think anybody thinks that this is isn’t going to be the most competitive governor’s race in the country,\" said Brandon Scholz, a Republican strategist and former Wisconsin GOP party executive director.\n\nScholz said one of Walker’s greatest assets is the strength of a Republican statewide organization that he helped build. “You see how hard Walker’s working: he’s an 8-event-a-day kind of guy. He’s always been a workhorse, all the time. He’s ramped it up even more.”\n\nRepublicans contend the Walker political machine, which features a tested field strategy and foot soldiers already in place, will combat those outside forces. They point to the contested Aug. 14 GOP Senate primary, where Leah Vukmir was vastly outspent but still defeated Kevin Nicholson. Walker didn’t endorse in the race, but his son, Alex, served as Vukmir’s political director and the GOP party apparatus went all in for her.\n\n“The fact that she won shows that the Walker organization is as powerful today as it was in 2016 when it was mobilized on behalf of Ted Cruz,” said Republican pollster Chris Wilson, who ran analytics for Nicholson’s campaign, referring to Cruz’s resounding victory over Trump in the Wisconsin presidential primary. “The only area I can speak to with any level of authority is we got our ass kicked by a ground game — a grassroots Walker organization — that will be just as energized in November.”\n\nThe import of Wisconsin’s governor’s race is not lost on either party. Toppling Walker, long a symbol of anti-union and conservative policies, would deliver an emotional windfall to the left and serve to shore up a pivotal swing state for Democrats in the runup to 2020.\n\nFor Republicans, beating back Democratic enthusiasm in a key Midwestern state Trump unexpectedly won by less than 25,000 votes in 2016, would hold just as much significance.\n\nThey expect Evers, first elected statewide as superintendent in 2009, will be at a spending disadvantage against Walker, who’s stockpiled a greater cash reserve than he did at this point in 2014.\n\nBut the cavalry is coming for Evers. The Democratic Governors Association has already committed at least $3.8 million, while other major groups expected to give resources to Evers’ campaign include former Attorney General Eric Holder’s redistricting committee, Obama’s Organizing for Action, Tom Steyer’s NextGen America and the Democratic National Committee.\n\n“I don’t think this is about Democratic enthusiasm in Madison and Milwaukee, it’s about Democratic enthusiasm and a backlash to Trump and Walker everywhere in Wisconsin,” said Sachin Chheda, a Democratic strategist and former Milwaukee County party chair.\n\nChheda points to “a massive shift to the left” in what was once solid Walker territory — including special elections in Green Bay’s Brown County and in the Twin Cities suburbs in St. Croix County.\n\nDemocrats also cite three public polls in recent weeks — NBC/Marist , Marquette and Suffolk/Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel — show independent voters are breaking from Walker, a daunting signal given that the state is almost evenly split politically, making them an essential part of the governor’s path to victory.\n\n“What all of those polls said is that independents are going for Evers over Walker by 10 points. Walker has generally won independents when he’s gotten to victory,” Chheda said.\n\nWhile Walker is expected to again win the vote-rich, GOP suburban counties outside of Milwaukee — he dominates in the so-called “WOW” counties where turnout is high — Chheda said if Democrats can nibble at the margins, it would make it much more difficult for Walker to win statewide.\n\nThe Trump factor could play a role in those suburbs. Even Republicans admit Trump’s unfiltered rants on social media and a slew of scandals hitting his inner circle could prompt GOP voters to stay home in November, including those heartened by Trump’s policies on immigration and taxes.\n\n“This guy just says and does things that make you recoil,” Scholz, the Republican consultant, said of Trump. “The balancing test there is: OK, you’ve had victories on issues that you’ve long wanted, but the guy doing them makes you want to throw up in your mouth. What do you do? Do you stay home and not vote? Or do you vote for the folks on the ticket, to make sure that what goes on for Republicans and conservatives, and what goes on in the state capitol is what you want?”\n\nOne stat with which both parties can agree is the direction rural voters are leaning, and that’s with Walker. Rural Wisconsin counties with populations of 10,000 people or less have long held steady for Walker, and neither side believes that’ll change in November.\n\n“Scott Walker and Wisconsin Republicans have earned the support of hard-working families in rural parts of the state because they've stood up for them and delivered results,” Walker senior campaign advisor Brian Reisinger said. “Democrats lost touch with those voters a long time ago, and they're not likely to win them back.”", "clickbait": null}

That’s my main takeaway from reading 20 Bob Woodward books in the past four weeks. No one can beat Woodward at getting the story of the White House from the inside, from the perspective of the decision makers as they saw themselves. People tell Woodward things they shouldn’t, from the alarming (Trump aides swiping memos from his desk) to the mundane (Nixon trying to gnaw open a childproof cap on a pill bottle with his teeth). He may be the sole practitioner of a form that occupies a space between journalism and history, one that tries to balance immediacy with detail. When he’s onto a good story—the resignation of a president, Iran-Contra, America’s post-9/11 wars—there’s no one better, or at least no one better who’s faster.\n\nI began reading and ranking every freaking Woodward book—all of 20 of them; that’s almost 10,000 pages—when Fear, the new book about President Donald Trump, was announced last month. I read four on vacation in mid-August, then four more the next week, and then five more, and seven more. I learned a lot, even as I learned that not all palace intrigue is intriguing.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhy did I do it? Was it to uncover how the presidency has changed since Watergate? To prove that I could? So that you wouldn’t have to? All of the above. Still, I wouldn’t do it again, and neither should anybody else.\n\nPolitico Magazine acquired a copy of Fear this week, and I’ve read it. So here we go:\n\n\n\n***\n\n20. The Man Who Would Be President\n\nIt’s not quite accurate to say that I read this book, though I did turn every page. Co-written by David Broder, it’s a collection of articles, first published in The Washington Post during the buildup to the 1992 campaign, about Vice President Dan Quayle. Either Woodward or his publicist has banished the book from his website, which contains a lengthy description—and purchase button—for every other title that put his name on a dust jacket. Eighteen—soon to be 19—books, it says, and 12 No.1 bestsellers! But what about No. 20?\n\nSome Woodward acolytes argue that The Man Who Would Be President isn’t a book, because it was conceived and published as a newspaper series. You know, I’m looking at it right now, and it’s a book. It has pages and everything. Chapter 6 is titled, “The Vice President’s Driving Passion: Quayle Unleashes Competitive Energy on the Golf Course.” Woodward delights in uncovering details that presidents and senior administration figures have scrubbed from their official histories and omitted from their memoirs. Sorry, Bob. I found your smoking gun.\n\n19. The Price of Politics\n\nEver since State of Denial, his third book about the George W. Bush administration, Woodward has fashioned himself as much an analyst of the presidency as a just-the-facts conduit of White House secrets, gossip and intrigue. The Price of Politics cements this ascension from Washington Post cops reporter to D.C. eminence by opening with a first-person anecdote from the Gridiron Club dinner, one that condemns Barack Obama, then a newly elected senator from Illinois, as an inexperienced narcissist.\n\nAlas, then Woodward recedes from the story, a deadeningly thorough chronicle of the debt-ceiling negotiations between Barack Obama and John Boehner. Would I have been kinder to this book if it hadn’t been the 18th Bob Woodward book I read in the past four weeks? Maybe! But Michiko Kakutani called The Price of Politics “often tedious” when she reviewed it for the New York Times. Writing in the home turf of Woodward’s Washington Post, Jeff Shesol concurred, “If the hallmark of a Bob Woodward book is that it puts you in the room, you may well, before long, start clawing for the exits.”\n\nOr, as Woodward writes in the final paragraph, “There was so much effort, most of it sincere, but so little result.” He means the budget negotiations. I think.\n\n18. Obama’s Wars\n\nIt could be that No-Drama Obama just made for low-drama Woodward. There’s little that Woodward appears to enjoy more than quoting some presidential cursing, but no matter how impatient Obama gets with his generals in this account of his Afghanistan policy, POTUS stays PG-rated. “I’m pissed” is as profane as it gets, but even then “he didn’t raise his voice much.” (In The Price of Politics, Obama does tell some Democrats, “Stop this bullshit,” but still, Woodward says the president was only “close to losing his temper.”) At another moment, the best a frustrated Obama can muster is, “This presentation strains credulity.”\n\nIn both books, Obama is damaged by his distaste for politics and his newness to Washington. When Obama chooses Jim Jones as his national security adviser, Woodward writes, “He seemed to have reached the baffling conclusion that the lack of a personal relationship could be an asset.” John Podesta was “not sure,” Woodward adds, “that Obama felt anything, especially in his gut.” Instead, the president “intellectualized … essentially picking up the emotions of others and translating them into ideas.”\n\nBest anecdote: Richard Holbrooke, the newly appointed special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, invites the Pakistani ambassador to lunch at the Hay-Adams Hotel. Holbrooke insists on a public location “so it gets reported in the newspaper.” No one notices.\n\n17. Plan of Attack\n\nWhen the first Iraq war ended in 1991, there was a lot of talk about the end of America’s lingering “Vietnam syndrome.” By the time the second Iraq war began a decade later, Vietnam syndrome had been replaced by Gulf War syndrome, a national assumption that war could be brief, sterile and free of sacrifice. Plan of Attack is Woodward’s first, and definitely not last (he wrote four Bush at War books, amounting to more than 2,000 pages in eight years) stab at explaining what happened next.\n\nIt was heralded as Woodward’s comeback when it was published, but to my eye it’s the least of his four George W. Bush books. Plan of Attack is all war planning, but very little war, and it lacks the novelistic intimacy of Woodward’s best work. The tidbits that got Washington tittering 14 years ago (Colin Powell’s “Pottery Barn rule,” George Tenet’s “slam dunk,” Bush’s invocation of a “higher Father” than his dad) remain, and Plan of Attack is an important document of how and why the United States invaded with too few troops to win the peace (see: Donald Rumsfeld). But the characters in that drama are more vividly painted in Bush at War, and the consequences aren’t fully revealed until State of Denial and The War Within, which in many ways feel like Woodward’s attempts at a Plan of Attack do-over.\n\nUnderappreciated anecdote: The CIA floods Kurdistan with so many Benjamins to pay its sources that everything, “even a cup of coffee,” starts to cost $100.\n\n16. Maestro\n\nLike Plan of Attack, Woodward’s story of how Alan Greenspan helped create the prosperity of the 1990s feels like half a book. Unlike Plan of Attack, we never get the sequel, or the revision. There’s little about the asset bubbles—in stocks and in housing—whose bursting would define the next decade of economic policymaking, other than Greenspan’s uncertainty as to whether there’s anything he can safely do about them. This book, in short, could use some Ben Bernanke. (Janet Yellen, who was a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 1994 to 1997, does pop up now and again to fret that Greenspan isn’t putting on the brakes.) Still, we get an inside account of Greenspan’s Fed and its decision-making, not to mention his mastery of Washington schmoozing.\n\nMemorable anecdote: When Greenspan asked Andrea Mitchell to marry him, his proposal was so opaque that “either she had not understood what he was saying or it had failed to register”—on two different occasions.\n\n15. The Brethren\n\nWoodward’s first book after The Final Days, co-written with Scott Armstrong, begins as SCOTUS for Dummies: “The United States Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, is the final forum for appeal in the American judiciary.” While Woodward and Armstrong’s infiltration of the cloistered realm of justices and their clerks is impressive, the result reads like a collection of chronological anecdotes from the Burger Court, with little attempt to weigh their importance or meaning. Even so, anyone who thinks the Supreme Court wasn’t political in the 1970s will have their illusions dashed by reading about the vote-trading and logrolling in this book. And the deliberations over the Nixon tapes are like the second half of the political Law & Order episode that began in All the President’s Men.\n\nWoodward and Armstrong also gleefully track the Court’s struggles to define obscenity (“no erections and no insertions,” Byron White concludes at one point, and William Brennan’s clerks also apply what they call a “limp dick” standard: “Oral sex was tolerable if there was no erection”). The “humorous high point of most terms” was “movie day,” when justices and clerks watch the pornos under consideration in obscenity appeals.\n\nPossibly the most current sentences in the book: “It was only recently that activism on the Court had become ‘liberal’ activism, Rehnquist reminded them. Only forty years before, the Court’s activists were conservatives. The balance was once again shifting back, Rehnquist said. Once it had, liberals would be the ones calling for judicial restraint and chiding the conservatives for ignoring precedent.”\n\n14. Fear\n\nDonald Trump makes for pretty good copy, even if Woodward hasn’t turned up all that much—or at least all that much beyond the book’s jaw-dropping prologue, in which Gary Cohn lifts a document (an order to withdraw from a trade agreement with South Korea that Trump was about to sign) from the president’s desk. The theme, beyond Trump’s ignorance and dishonesty, is that the deep state is real: An “administrative coup d’état” has been carried out by Trump’s Cabinet and staff to contradict the president’s constitutional authority. For instance, when Trump tells James Mattis, “Let’s go in; let’s kill the fucking lot of them” after a Syrian chemical attack, Mattis hangs up and tells an aide, “We’re not going to do any of that.”\n\nIt’s also just super dishy. Trump says H.R. McMaster dresses like a “beer salesman.” Jared Kushner tells Steve Bannon of his father-in-law, “He doesn’t have a lot of cash.” Trump asks Kellyanne Conway, before offering her the job as his campaign manager, “Are you willing to not see your kids for a few months?” We go deep inside the Rex Tillerson “fucking moron” meeting at the Pentagon. An image of Trump’s handwriting—the words “TRADE IS BAD” on a speech he’s revising—is reproduced.\n\nAt the same time, you can tell that this one was put together on deadline. Woodward’s books are often most interesting when he inserts himself as a character and reveals his reportorial decision-making and the Post’s newsroom deliberations alongside the White House dope. In Fear, those moments of journalistic drama are replaced with moments in which Woodward reveals observations he made during his appearances on Fox News Sunday.\n\n13. The Agenda\n\nWhen I first read this book almost 25 years ago, I loved it. Clinton’s purple rages! Long-term interest rates! A surprise cameo by Atul Gawande!\n\nOK, I only noticed the Gawande cameo upon rereading it. We’ve got all the materials here for a great Woodward book—characters who are still historically important, and in ways (like Hillary Clinton) that weren’t fully grasped at the time. But while the passage of Clinton’s deficit-reduction plan in his first year in office was undeniably important, from the perspective of 2018 it feels like an odd choice for a book about Bill Clinton (not that Woodward could have known that in 1994). Also, there’s way too much David Boren.\n\nStill, The Agenda begins with a strikingly intimate scene, with Hillary and Bill Clinton seemingly in bed on an Arkansas morning in 1991, discussing why now is the time for Bill to run for the presidency. He describes James Carville nicely (“a bald, pointy head and riveting, almost sinister eyes”). There’s Quality Cursing (Bill Clinton: “You mean to tell me that the success of the program and my reelection hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders?”). The climax is striking, as Warren Buffett calls Bob Kerrey, the Democratic senator from Nebraska, to recommend that he vote for Clinton’s deficit-reduction plan.\n\nFrom a post-presidential viewpoint, here’s the most memorable quote in The Agenda: “If I don’t get health care done,” Clinton says, “I’ll wish I didn’t run for president.”\n\n12. The Commanders\n\nThis Bush at War prequel feels like the first time Woodward settled on the form he describes as “somewhere between newspaper journalism and history.” He set out to write a book about the Pentagon, presumably one that would resemble Veil, his book about the Central Intelligence Agency. The invasions of Panama and Iraq changed his approach, and his deadline. The main characters are Dick Cheney, then the defense secretary, and Colin Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the knowledge that the two men will be linked again in 20 years adds to the story’s salience.\n\n“This book is not about most of the things the military does,” Woodward writes of his method. “It is not about weapons procurement, defense budget fights, recruiting, training or military field exercises. With a few brief exceptions, it does not touch on the way the military has actually fought the wars of the last few years. It will not take you into the helicopters descending on Panama City, or to the desert tank battles in Iraq and Kuwait. It is above all a book about how the United States decides to fight its wars before shots are fired. The main setting is Washington, and the main action is the tug-and-pull among the players in the military decision-making process, both inside and outside the Pentagon.”\n\n11. The Last of the President’s Men\n\nA memoir of Alexander Butterfield, the Nixon aide who disclosed the existence of the president’s Oval Office taping system to the Senate Watergate Committee, this book is most notable for documenting what a weirdo Nixon was.\n\nIt also includes Woodward’s favorite Nixon White House anecdote, which appears in multiple books: Staff assistants in the Nixon White House were called “Higbys,” after Larry Higby, chief of staff H.R. Haldeman’s executive assistant. Eventually, Higby gets his own Higby, who becomes known as “Higby’s Higby.”\n\nButterfield is essentially hired as “Haldeman’s Haldeman,” but spends his early days hiding from Nixon, who is so introverted he won’t look at or speak to Butterfield for days. “If the president comes in, you just walk out,” Haldeman tells Butterfield. “It’ll spook him if he sees you.”\n\nIn an echo of a moment in All the President’s Men, Woodward calls Henry Kissinger at one point to talk about a Nixon memo acknowledging years of bombing “failure” in Southeast Asia. “That is true,” Kissinger says, before adding, “Now, you’re not going to quote me on this, are you?”\n\nWoodward writes, “Yes, I said I would.”\n\n10. Wired\n\nA book about comedy, drugs and rock ’n’ roll by an author who seems to understand none of them. Three decades later, Woodward’s idea of an au courant pop-culture reference is still Dynasty (in Fear) or Columbo (in The War Within). Woodward now describes Wired as a book about “the Hollywood drug culture,” and that’s probably a more accurate description of it than a biography of John Belushi, even if Belushi’s life is the window into that culture. A reader of Wired might wonder if Belushi was ever funny or charming, or why people kept hiring him—at Second City, on Saturday Night Live, for movies like Animal House and The Blues Brothers—if he was so unreliable and unpleasant to work with. You start to understand why, say, Nixon’s admirers resent the attention paid to Watergate at the exclusion of all else. But as a chronicle of one man’s addiction, with lots of bold-faced names—Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro are in the story of the night of Belushi’s death—this is quite a read.\n\n9. The War Within\n\nThe fourth Bush at War book could use more Dick Cheney. And like Shakespeare, Woodward’s tragedies tend to be better than the comedies. This one doesn’t end with a marriage, but it’s the best good-news Woodward book, the story of how David Petraeus and George W. Bush salvaged the Iraq war with the “surge” from 2006 to 2008.\n\nYet Woodward also uses this book to meditate on why the war went so wrong for so long. “The president and his team had become marketers of Bush’s certainty,” he writes. Rumsfeld sits in his office “trying to control the world through his snowflakes,” his short and constant Pentagon memos. Rummy seems to think that war is like welfare, that too much American security will “create a dependency among the Iraqis.” Colin Powell unloads for 20 minutes on the Iraq Study Group about the war-planning mistakes of Gen. Tommy Franks.\n\nWoodward writes, with unusual directness, “I have never doubted the sincerity of the president’s convictions. But convictions alone are not enough.” He concludes that Bush spent “three years in denial” about the Iraq war, that he was “intolerant” of confrontation and debate, and that he “engaged in the war rhetorically but maintained an odd detachment from its management.”\n\n8. The Secret Man\n\nThis is minor Woodward, but it’s incredibly enjoyable. Much of the first half reads like the footnotes to All the President’s Men. But it’s also the closest thing Woodward has written to a memoir, beginning with his first meeting with Mark Felt in the White House when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant. He discloses when he broke the rules of his agreement with Felt, including when he described him as “Deep Throat” in All the President’s Men. He admits to lying to a Post colleague, Richard Cohen, to wave him off the scent when Cohen was about to publish a column nailing Felt as Woodward’s source. It’s probably the best window we have into who Woodward is as a person and how he thinks. Plus, Nixon seems extra-weird—if not quite as weird as in The Last of the President’s Men—and Woodward quotes Kant.\n\n7. Shadow\n\nRichard Nixon is the Kilgore Trout of the Woodward literary corpus, a recurring character who just keeps showing up. In Shadow, Woodward looks at how Watergate—especially special prosecutors and independent counsels—affected the five presidents after Nixon, from Ford to Clinton. The Watergate metaphor is strained at times, and Woodward underplays the legacy of Gary Hart in the presidency of Bill Clinton, but there are lots of good stories here, including the time Jimmy Carter lied to Woodward and Ben Bradlee, and a powerfully sad post-presidential deposition of Ronald Reagan, who can’t remember anything and says, “It’s like I wasn’t president at all.”\n\n6. State of Denial\n\nA merciless recounting of the postwar planning—and lack thereof—undertaken by Donald Rumsfeld’s Pentagon, as well as a fuller chronicle of George W. Bush’s rise and fall. The four Bush at War books repeat some material, even sentences and what feel like paragraphs. You get the feeling that just as the administration kept trying to get the war right, Woodward kept returning to the story, trying to get a fuller, more complete picture. In the end, he wrote three books just on Iraq—Plan of Attack, State of Denial, and The War Within. This is the story’s second act, when everything looks as bad as it will ever get. It’s The Empire Strikes Back of Woodward’s Iraq trilogy.\n\n5. The Choice\n\nDisclosure: I’m from Kansas. The pleasure of recognition I get when Bob Dole says “Jiminy” (my dad would say “Jiminy Cricket”), or when he uses “visit” as a verb that means “sit and talk,” may lead you not to trust me on the merits of The Choice. This is the book, after all, that inspired Joan Didion to fillet Woodward in the New York Review of Books as a writer of “political pornography,” of “books in which memorable cerebral activity is virtually absent.”\n\nIf The Choice is pornography, all right then I’ll go to hell. If this book were written by Michael Lewis or Mark Leibovich, it would be regarded as a campaign classic. Hillary Clinton communes with Eleanor Roosevelt in the White House, and Bob Dole spends so much time talking to Woodward that even Woodward runs out of questions. Joe Lieberman (!) describes the arrival of Dick Morris in the White House as an “act of God” that will save the Democratic Party. And the cast includes not just Clinton and Dole but important later figures like Cheney, Powell and Hillary Clinton. George Will comes across as the George Conway of the 1990s, writing a column titled “Good Man … Wrong Job?” about Dole, the candidate for whom his wife, Mari, works as an adviser and speechwriter.\n\nYou should know there’s basically nothing about Ken Starr or Whitewater. You have to read Shadow for that. The only time the word “blowjob” appears in a book that covers the period when Bill Clinton met an intern in the Oval Office is when Scott Reed, Dole’s campaign manager, complains about Colin Powell getting “blowjob interviews” from the press.\n\n4. Veil\n\nLike The Brethren, Veil is very disconnected, bouncing from Nicaragua to Lebanon to Russia to Libya, but it’s tied together by the person of Ronald Reagan’s CIA director, Bill Casey, and the backdrop of Iran-Contra—as well as the reader’s knowledge that 9/11 is coming, which recontextualizes many of the events in the Middle East. As with All the President’s Men, Woodward is a character in the drama, and Ben Bradlee shows up, too, as the two journalists clash with Casey on what should be reported and when.\n\nWhen this book came out, some were skeptical that Woodward actually snuck into Casey’s hospital bed for a final interview—a near-deathbed confession that pays off much better than the interview he seeks with a dying Mark Felt, who suffers from dementia, in The Secret Man. I’ve read too much Woodward by now to be skeptical. Like Casey, “I believed.”\n\n3. Bush at War\n\nMy recollection of the reception of this book about the first 100 days after 9/11—a reputation that Woodward gets modestly defensive about in The War Within—is that it was a puff piece. But reading it now, George W. Bush comes off as the same president he is in the sequels: resolute but impatient and uninformed, with an administration riven by a conflict between Powell and Rumsfeld, who begins agitating for war with Iraq from the very start. This is my vote for “the best since The Final Days,” a riveting, novelistic account of a crucial moment in history. Is it the whole story? Of course not. It is, as Woodward concedes, “an inside account, largely the story as the insiders saw it, heard it and lived it.” Still, needs more Cheney.\n\n2. The Final Days\n\nThere’s a reason reviewers so often seem to be proclaiming that the latest Woodward book is “his best since The Final Days.” This book, the second of the two that were co-written by Carl Bernstein, is fantastic, the model for all that came after. Also, it helps that it’s about the only president to resign. As we said at the outset, if you’re going to be a fly, it helps to have a good wall.\n\nPlus, the ending now reads like a post-credits scene for the beginning of the rest of the Woodward cinematic universe, as newly minted President Gerald Ford writes one word on a memo, recommending his new chief of staff: “Rumsfeld.”\n\n1. All the President’s Men\n\nIt opens like a thriller, with burglars in a courtroom—one of whom soon discloses that he works for the CIA. All the President’s Men is a true crime story and also a newsroom drama, and the knowledge that Mark Felt was Deep Throat makes the book more interesting, not less, as it makes it easier to weigh Felt’s knowledge and his motivations. The elimination of what used to be the book’s central mystery also shifts the reader’s focus from Who Is Deep Throat? to Holy Cow, Two Metro Reporters Are Taking Down a President. The first, and still the best. This one I’d read again.", "clickbait": null}

I mean, it’s real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the market place. ’Course don’t ever tell anybody that they’re not free, ’cause then they’re gunna get real busy killing and maiming to prove to you that they are. Oh yeah they’re gunna talk to you and talk to you and talk to you about individual freedom. But they see a free individual, it’s gunna scare ’em.”\n\nThis past weekend at Harley-Davidson’s 115th anniversary celebration, which drew roughly 150,000 bikers to events across Milwaukee, the strains of Easy Rider were still in the air. Nearly a half-century after the film’s debut, the motorcycle remains a symbol of freedom—a way into a world apart from the world, a world that’s freer, more primal, more alive. But today, there’s at least one new development: For many in the crowd, motorcycle culture translates to a full-fledged embrace of President Donald Trump, who they say embodies the same rebellious spirit. They defended the commander in chief, despite—or perhaps even because of—his public spat with their favored brand.\n\nAt Harley’s global headquarters, where bikers stopped for photos amidst their tours of the city, the word “FREEDOM” greets visitors as they enter, cut out of steel in seven-foot letters. Behind the reception desk are more cutouts: “MUSCLE” and “ReBEL” are the largest and most prominent, with “FREEDOM” and “BELONGING” bridging the gap between them. In a conference room where bikers mill about, a paragraph made to look like an American flag adorns the wall. “We don’t do fear,” it says, adding later, “Freedom and wind outlast hard times. And the rumble of an engine drowns out all the blah, blah, blah on the evening news.”\n\nIn Harleys, somehow rebellion and patriotism fuse together. The flag and the military loom large in the festivities. At the anniversary kickoff, three paratroopers jump from a Vietnam-era helicopter while a company spokesman reminds the assembled bikers that they are standing in Milwaukee’s Veterans Park. “That’s America right there, that’s incredible,” he says as the soldiers drift down with a giant flag, thanking them “for being the badasses that you are.” “We’re going to sing the national anthem, ladies and gentlemen,” the spokesman says when the soldiers are safely on the ground, “because again, we are celebrating America right along with this incredible American brand.”\n\nAfter the ceremony, I talk with Jerry Bellin, 60, a retired union ironworker who rode 90 miles here from his Wisconsin home. A long white beard extends down Bellin’s face beneath a confederate battle flag bandana. He wears the bandana, he says, because “it’s a rebel thing,” though he also says he wears it simply because a former tenant abandoned it amongst debris at an apartment he owns. The same word comes up when Bellin talks about the president. “He ran as a Republican, but I just like the rebel-ism,” he says.\n\nBellin shrugs off the president’s spat with Harley. Earlier this summer, Harley announced it would expand overseas production in order to evade E.U. tariffs levied as retaliation against Trump’s tariffs on steel. In a mid-August Twitter post, the president encouraged a boycott of the company. “Other countries do it to us,” Bellin says, referring to tariffs. “And we should protect ourselves. Without being racist or anything, but you see all the Asian people here? Look what kind of car they’re driving. They’re driving all Toyotas and Hondas and stuff. They protect their own country, even though they’re here. And that’s just the way it should be. Germans should be buying a German car, I think. Americans should be buying American.”\n\nI hear this kind of thing repeatedly over several days: support for the president and indifference about both Harley’s response to the tariffs and the president’s attacks on Harley—the company whose bikes, of course, everyone is riding and celebrating. Some of the bikers I speak with are unaware of any discord at all.\n\nA man wearing a MAGA hat and a Harley shirt on the fairgrounds, who gives his name only as Marty, says of the president’s call for a boycott of Harley: “Oh, I didn’t get involved in that too much. I don’t know. I really can’t comment on it. I can comment on some other stuff if you want me to. Trump’s the man. He’s got my vote and I’m proud of it and he’s doing wonderful things for our economy and our country.”\n\nDean Gilbert, 62, who traveled with his wife and son from North Carolina, calls the tariff issues “news media hype.” “I don’t think it’s as bad as the news media says it is. And I may be wrong, but look,” he says, gesturing to his bike a few feet away, “how much steel is there in a Harley? The beef was that tariffs on the steel are gunna raise the price of the bikes. I don’t know if I believe that.” As to the president’s call for a boycott, Gilbert says, “you’ll have a few people that’ll say ‘I just won’t spend as much,’ but if you ride a Harley, you’ll ride a Harley. It wouldn’t stop me from buying one.”\n\nAfter Chuck Lennon, 67, has his picture taken in front of Harley headquarters on his yellow chrome bike, he tells me he “would rather Harley not build overseas, but I can see why they need to.” Lennon, a retired engineer from Las Vegas, generally supports the president, but he would not boycott Harley. “Trump says a lot of things,” he says. “It’s OK. We elected him.” Lennon is more concerned about “a small minority of groups that are trying to either rattle or destroy this country” than about Harley or tariffs. “The worst part about it,” he says, “is I think half of the protesters you see that are out there, they’re actually paid to be demonstrators. I honestly believe that.”\n\nIn the Harley-Davidson Museum, a famous speech from another 1960s biker film starring Peter Fonda, The Wild Angels—“We wanna be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man. And we wanna get loaded.”—is featured prominently in a montage of old movie clips. So are scenes of Fonda, Hopper and Nicholson out cruising in Easy Rider, Fonda seated on his “Captain America” chopper painted with stars and stripes. A replica of that bike sits opposite where the montage plays.\n\nA flag hangs from a pedestrian bridge at the Harley-Davidson headquarters. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nI notice a man watch the seven-minute montage and then return to the video screen a short time later to watch a second time. Afterwards, I ask what the clips mean to him, and the man, a retired soldier from Texas who gives his name only as Jon, talks about Easy Rider and feeling free on the road when he got his first Harley at 14, now 46 years ago. Then the conversation turns to Trump.\n\n“I’m not really familiar with what’s going on with Harley and all that,” he says. He would rather talk about immigration, telling me that “Germany was a good place” before “Merkel let all the Muslims in from Syria and it changed the culture over there.” Now “that place is going to shit.” “People coming into this country,” he says, need to “do it legally, and learn our traditions. I don’t want to know their damn shit. I really don’t.”\n\nThis, of course, reflects a particular—and narrow—view of freedom, rebellion and patriotism. Harley, too, offers a particular view, one rich in paradoxes. The company sells a pre-packaged rebellion, a starter kit that offers just enough customization for each rebel, on his or her own bike and in his or her own logoed paraphernalia, to feel unique. It sells freedom by way of conformity, sells consumers a rejection of consumerism.\n\nHarley does all this at rapt attention to flag and country, rendering the rebellion less against “the man” and more against the danger of an ill-defined decline. It unites a tribe around the shared memory of a mythic time when freedom, rebellion and country all were a harmonious whole, embodied within the swashbuckling cowboy, a man beholden to none, free to roam and take whatever he thought was his.\n\n“Who among us would not want to climb on a machine dripping in freedom and American style?” Bill Thomas, 64, says when I ask him why he rides a Harley. We are seated with his wife Linda, 65, at a makeshift bar on a beach along Lake Michigan. Earlier there were Harley races in the sand. “To breathe the very air that collides with the chrome steel you ride? ’Cause all we want to do is be free to ride our machines, get loaded when we want to, and not be hassled by the man.”\n\nBill laughs as he acknowledges that he is borrowing part of Fonda’s speech from The Wild Angels, the same one playing in the Harley museum. But what really got him on a bike, he says, was seeing Easy Rider at a drive-in theater when he was 15: “Ever since then, all I wanted was a motorcycle.” Now, Linda chimes in, he has three in the garage at their Pittsburgh home. “All Harleys,” Linda says. “Is there anything else?”\n\nIt is fitting—ironic, too—that Easy Rider has taken on such a central role in the mythology of Harley-Davison. Late in the film, Hopper and Fonda sit by another campfire, this time without Nicholson, whose character has died in a senseless act of violence. As Fonda broods, Hopper tries to cheer him up.\n\n“We did it!” he says. “We’re rich, man. We’re retirin’ in Florida now, mister.” Hopper is recalling the opening scenes of the film, where he and Fonda are middlemen in a drug deal, selling cocaine to a man in a Rolls Royce for a bundle of cash. The bills are still hidden in the fuel tank of Fonda’s bike. But the reminder does not cheer Fonda. “We blew it,” he says to Hopper, grimacing. “We blew it.”\n\nThe bikers thought they were buying their freedom, but really they were selling out, trading in their ideals for an easy payoff from the establishment. And retiring to Florida is not exactly the stuff of biker lore. Their vaunted freedom, it turns out, was just a mirage, a fantasy. When Fonda and Hopper’s lives are taken in the film’s iconic final scene, they are not merely victims of the killers, but of themselves.\n\nAnd yet, at least among the aging generation that still makes up Harley’s core constituency, the fantasy lives on. Fonda and Hopper’s biker characters are heroes and martyrs who stand for freedom, a totem powerful enough that in its service both Harley and the president can be right, or close enough to right that the disagreement doesn’t really matter. “’Course,” as Nicholson said, “don’t ever tell anybody they’re not free.”\n\nJohn F.

Its leaders have a habit of vaulting to the presidency. But though the state is home to what may be the country’s most liberal constituency, New York’s own government is a perpetual mockery of progressive values. Its elected Democrats have offered Democratic voters nothing but disappointment and outrage for decades.\n\nThe president of the United States himself is a product of New York’s rancid political waters, a real estate hustler who bragged in the 2016 election about buying off politicians before deciding to become one himself.\n\nBut incumbency is a difficult force to beat in New York (or anywhere else in America), and the litany of failures listed above would count as policy achievements in today’s Republican Party.

Andrew Cuomo (D) were convicted on corruption charges earlier this year, it remains very likely that he will be re-elected in November.\n\nThat leaves the New York attorney general as the best hope for cleaning up politics in New York and, perhaps, Washington.

James has cultivated a progressive record working within the New York political establishment, but her ties to toxic members of that establishment, including the governor, have hampered her throughout the campaign.\n\nThe national left has rallied behind Teachout, a staunch anti-corruption advocate whose academic book on the subject is a minor classic. Teachout has vowed to use the attorney general’s office to break the stranglehold that big finance and big real estate exercise over public spending priorities and has talked about functioning as a “regulator of last resort” for the country at large.\n\nSince so many major corporations are chartered in New York, Teachout has proposed opening investigations against them as a way to fight the Trump administration on everything from climate change to predatory lending. Like every other candidate in the race, she has vowed to relentlessly pursue any corrupt dealings within the Trump organization itself.\n\nBolstered by endorsements from The New York Times and the New York Daily News, Teachout has taken on the status of a front-runner. Several New York political figures, noting the way the wind is blowing, have defected to her camp. And in recent debates, James and other candidates have trained their fire on Teachout, all but ignoring one another.\n\nThe contest between Teachout and James is firmly within the established debate over how to go about reforming the Democratic Party ― not so much a question of values as one of tactics, a choice between a pragmatist who has notched small victories within a corrupt system and an idealistic outsider who promises to overhaul that very system.\n\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who entered the race on June 6, does not fit within this paradigm. In 2013, he was one of just nine Democrats in the House who voted with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in his gambit to suspend implementation of Obamacare ― a clash that resulted in a government shutdown. Two years later, he was one of only four House Democrats who voted with Republicans to bar undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing aid. He voted with Republicans on two major laws unwinding key parts of the post-financial crisis Wall Street reforms. One Maloney-backed repeal will enable banks to hide racial discrimination in mortgage lending, while another, authored by Citigroup lobbyists, provided federal subsidies to big banks trading in the risky derivatives at the heart of the 2008 crash. He has voted to increase Donald Trump’s military budget and expand his warrantless surveillance powers.\n\nA Maloney campaign spokesperson declined to address the lawmaker’s voting record with HuffPost.\n\nMaloney is even operating his campaign for attorney general as a test case on state campaign finance regulation. Teachout, a campaign finance expert, recently filed suit against him for moving $1.4 million raised for his congressional race into his state contest ― a move that, if upheld in court, would create a loophole to help politicians avoid state disclosure requirements and contribution limits.\n\nFront-runners with comfortable leads do not file lawsuits against their political opponents in the closing days of a campaign. The case is a risky strategic move indicating that Teachout views Maloney as a serious threat to the nomination. What little polling exists for the race suggests her fears are justified. Two polls released over the summer ― before Teachout began receiving high-profile endorsements ― gave James the lead, followed by Maloney in second and Teachout a close third. More than 40 percent of the electorate were still undecided, and majorities indicated they had either never heard of or had no opinion about James or Teachout.\n\nIn a contest like that, name recognition matters more than any policy position. The congressman, who has represented a swing district in the Hudson Valley since 2013, benefits most in that regard. The two ways to boost name recognition are through good press ― of which Teachout has secured plenty ― and ample television advertising. Maloney’s $3 million war chest ― more than five times what Teachout had raised as of Aug. 6 ― has helped put his smiling face on TV screens across New York state, which may be enough to put him over the top. His biggest funders include Wall Street banks, real estate developers and corporate law firms, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "clickbait": null}

Tim Ryan wants you to know: Just because he meditates doesn’t mean he’s soft. He’s from Ohio’s blue-collar Mahoning Valley, the steel valley, home of Youngstown, a district where 45,000 people voted for both him and Donald Trump.\n\nSo if you’ve read that Congress’ foremost advocate of mindfulness wants to run for president in 2020 by winning the “yoga vote”—and if that seems risky against an incumbent with a Triumph-the-Insult-Comic-Dog attack style—well, that’s only part of Ryan’s story.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“I think once you meet me, you realize I’m not necessarily some soft yoga guy,” says Ryan, a tall, well-built former high-school quarterback. “I’ve been on the picket line. I’ve been in the union halls. I’ll drink a Miller Lite with you.”\n\nFighter is a political compliment. Inner-peace seeker is not. But Ryan will tell you a candidate can be both. Ryan speaks in sports lingo even more than the average male pol. That’s how he pitches mindfulness to skeptics: It’s something he learned about from legendary former NBA coach Phil Jackson’s book, Sacred Hoops. “I always saw it as a performance enhancer,” Ryan says.\n\nSports talk is also how the eight-term congressman expresses the reasons he might, just might, run for president in 2020. “The only reason I entertain the conversations is that I’m tired of losing,” Ryan says. “I’m tired of playing defense.”\n\nAs Democrats try to reverse their 2016 losses in the Rust Belt, Ryan’s popularity in Ohio’s working class 13th Congressional District stands out. He far outran Hillary Clinton’s performance there, immune to her Midwestern collapse. When Ryan led a revolt against House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in late 2016, he pitched a leadership shift away from the coasts and toward a pro-worker economic agenda. Pelosi doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, and Ryan lost that vote by a 2-1 margin—but his challenge seems prescient two years later, as roughly 60 Democratic House candidates have declared they will not support the much-demonized Pelosi for speaker.\n\nThis summer came reports that Ryan is open to taking on Pelosi again, or even running for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president. A dozen bigger names might outrank Ryan on the presidential racing forms, he might be unknown outside Ohio and Capitol Hill, and he’s only 45. But Ryan believes he could help shape a Democratic answer to Trumpism that transcends geographic and economic boundaries—a coalition of yoga mats and hard hats.\n\nRyan’s traveling like a presidential candidate, hitting the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding dinner, going to California to fund-raise, barnstorming for Democrats in swing House districts, speaking at both the centrist Third Way think tank’s conference and the progressive Netroots Nation convention. He’s talking like a candidate, too.\n\n“Maybe the country needs a scrapper, a guy who’s not going to take any prisoners—sportsmanlike, but play to win,” Ryan says. “We collectively should be helping the people who have gotten screwed for the last 30 years, and not apologize for it,” Ryan says. “So that’s why, at the very least, I’m going to be part of shaping the national discussion. The very least.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nA political prodigy, Ryan was elected to the Ohio state Senate at age 27 and the U.S. House at 29. He succeeded his former boss, Jim Traficant, Youngstown’s bombastic, profane proto-Trump congressman. Ryan ran for the House in 2002, the year Traficant was convicted of bribery and racketeering and expelled from the chamber. In the Democratic primary, Ryan took on incumbent Rep. Tom Sawyer of Akron, who was competing on new turf due to redistricting. Ryan beat Sawyer by pulling a Trump: bashing his votes for NAFTA and trade with China—a winning play in the anti-free trade Mahoning Valley. In the general election, Ryan won 51 percent in a three-way race against Traficant (who got 15 percent from jail) and a Republican.\n\nThough a strong union supporter, Ryan developed a centrist reputation in Congress. He had an A rating from the NRA in his 2002 race. A practicing Roman Catholic, he opposed abortion rights. Then came his turning point.\n\nTim Ryan is reflected in the lens of a TV camera while speaking to reporters in November 2016, following a House Democratic Caucus election in which his effort to oust Nancy Pelosi as leader failed, 134-63. | AP\n\nOn a days-long retreat after the 2008 election, Ryan found that meditation helped him cope with the congressional grind of traveling and fundraising. He quickly integrated mindfulness into his policy program. “I recognized its potential to help transform core institutions in America—school, hospitals, the military, and social services,” Ryan wrote in his 2012 book, A Mindful Nation. “I felt that this simple practice could help my constituents face the many stressful challenges of daily life.”\n\nRyan advocates teaching mindfulness in schools and has sponsored deep-breathing and meditation programs in his district for veterans suffering from PTSD. “People will tease me a little bit about it,” Ryan says, “but you would be surprised at the amount of people who come up to me and say they’ve tried it, or they read my book and how much it’s helped them.”\n\nAs Ryan has embraced mindfulness, he’s also moved to the left politically, including on issues that fall along cultural fault lines.\n\nAfter the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, he distanced himself from the NRA, and after the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, he gave $20,000—the amount the NRA had contributed to his campaigns over the years—to gun-safety groups.\n\nIn 2015, Ryan announced that he now supported abortion rights, influenced by constituents who’d chosen abortion because of abuse and personal hardships. “Today, I am a 41-year-old father and husband,” he wrote in an Akron Beacon Journal op-ed. “I have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator.” Marriage and fatherhood influenced him. The final step in his rethinking, he says, came before the 2014 birth of their son, Brady, as Ryan and his wife, Andrea, nervously awaited the results of prenatal testing. “As we were sitting there, I thought to myself, ‘Man, if something’s really, really wrong here, should the government be in this room, telling us what we should or should not do?’ I’ve got a little bit of that libertarian streak in me on certain issues, and I was like, ‘You can’t do this anymore.’”\n\nRyan joined the healthy-food movement with his second book, 2014’s The Real Food Revolution, itself a mix of feel-good self-help and crunchy policy proposals (decentralization of seed production, labeling of GMOs). He voted against this year’s farm bill after writing op-eds about the need to help family farmers more and reduce subsidies for big agriculture.\n\nThis year, he endorsed marijuana legalization, citing the potential for new tax revenue and the “unjust” fact that “the burden of these low-level drug charges fall on minority communities.”\n\nRepublicans portray Ryan’s changed positions as a sign that he lacks core values. “Obviously, his ambitions are higher than his current status,” says Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken. “He seemed to be a Blue Dog moderate Democrat when he first ran. Now he’s espousing very liberal positions. I see him as more of an opportunist than a principled Democrat.”\n\nEven so, you’ll still see Ryan described as centrist sometimes. Last year, he broke with his party to support a corporate tax cut, though he ended up voting against the tax-reform law. He’s not that far left. He says he opposes a federal jobs-guarantee program: “I think the path forward is to get private capital into communities and create a new and better free enterprise system,” he says.\n\nBut he’s not that centrist, either. He has supported single-payer health care since at least 2007, and he’s a reliable vote for labor and against free trade, earning a 98 percent lifetime rating from the AFL-CIO.\n\n“I think he’s gotten much better over the years, and really matured as an officeholder,” says Harriet Applegate, executive secretary of the North Shore AFL-CIO in Cleveland. Applegate, who has worked with Ryan on statewide labor issues, recalls the young Ryan as a “swashbuckling maverick.” She thinks his mindfulness training has mellowed the swagger. “He’s made himself a more complete person and shed some of that uber-masculinity.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC News’ Dan Harris just after Trump’s inauguration, Ryan said he hoped meditation could help him see through Trump’s bombast to find an issue they could work on together. Did it work? Ryan laughs. “It helped me not get frustrated when he has not worked with us,” he says. Like some other Democrats, he’d hoped to work with Trump on infrastructure and maybe health care. “I thought there were going to be a few issues that we would maybe find some common ground on. And then he came right in and torched the joint.”\n\nTrump’s belligerence seems to threaten a lot of Americans’ inner peace — causing them extreme stress, even trauma. Can mindfulness help? Ryan, who meditates for about 25 minutes each morning, suggests politically minded people should claim some quiet, silent time every day. “Do it for a week or two, and you will notice that there’s a little bit of space between stimulus and response,” Ryan says. “We can get so overstimulated that we get hyper-reactive and we develop habitual reactions, to Trump, or politics, or our own personal relationships. It helps you create a little bit of space that will get your blood pressure down.”\n\n\n\n***\n\nOhio’s Mahoning Valley used to vote deep-blue in presidential elections, but no longer. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Ryan’s 13th Congressional District, but only 51 percent to 44 percent, a plummet from Barack Obama’s 63-36 win over Mitt Romney there four years earlier. Trump’s opposition to free trade helped him in Ohio, Ryan thinks, as did the fact that many voters there were still struggling after eight years of Obama. “Because he was a Republican breaking orthodoxy, I think people gave him a chance,” Ryan says.\n\nRyan, though, won with 68 percent of the vote, beating his Republican opponent by 36 percentage points and outrunning Clinton in his district by 45,000 votes. That means roughly 45,000 of Ryan’s supporters in 2016 were Ryan-Trump voters.\n\nRyan says he’ll often chat with people who tell him they voted for him and for Trump, to understand their thinking. “Most of the time, it’s not an issue,” Ryan says—it’s about attitude. “Maybe it’s China. Maybe it’s taking on the system.” He thinks his constituents respect his early runs against fellow Democrats and his challenge of Pelosi. “People around here see me as the guy who was always taking on the establishment,” he says. “I’ve been on picket lines with them, and just lived with them for 16 years, so they know I’m with them.”\n\nWashington, UNITED STATES: Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (R) addresses the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee election night party in Washington, DC, 07 November 2006 as (L to R, background) Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Tim Ryan (D-OH), and Kendrick Meek (D-FL), .

Connelly led the Pledge of Allegiance at a 2016 Trump rally and organized the president’s 2017 visit to a Mahoning Valley AMVETS chapter. Connelly’s Facebook feed includes messages of support for Trump — and pictures of Connelly posing with Ryan at the dedication of a local veteran’s painting of George Washington.\n\n“This guy goes to bat and fights for us,” Connelly says of Ryan. “He fights for us veterans and a better country.” Connelly says he’s all for Ryan’s interest in meditation, because it’s a way to help vets with PTSD. “Do we always agree? No. But we do agree on China, the military and veterans’ issues. He never stops fighting.”\n\nConnelly says Ryan “comes from a blue-collar working family.” Ryan was raised in Niles, a one-time ironmaking town, by his single mother, Rochelle, a courthouse worker.\n\n“I think Tim Ryan gets where the working class is coming from in a way that a lot of Democrats don’t, and in a way the coastal Democrats seem not to,” says the AFL-CIO’s Applegate.\n\nRyan says the Democrats need a sharper economic message to win. He’s for a $15 minimum wage, but says that’s not enough. Many of his constituents, he says, lost $30 to $40 per hour jobs in the 2000s when the automotive supplier Delphi moved work from Warren to Mexico.\n\n“We are all for the ‘fight for 15,’ but my people were making $40 an hour, and now they’re making $15,” Ryan says. “We need to be a party saying, ‘We are not going to be happy until we get those $30, $40, $50 an hour jobs back for working-class people.”\n\nRyan says the “A Better Deal” agenda proposed by congressional Democratic leaders, including Pelosi, isn’t bold enough. He wants to rebuild communities “bypassed by globalization” by eliminating all blighted buildings within three to four years, wiring the communities with broadband, and funding education and early-stage startups.\n\nDoes Ryan want a rematch with Pelosi for the job of minority leader, or even speaker? “The door is open,” he says. “Clearly, she does not play well in a lot of the districts that we need to win.”\n\nPelosi has been dismissive of her once-and-maybe-future challenger. She called Ryan and fellow Pelosi critic Seth Moulton “inconsequential” in a July Rolling Stone interview. “They don’t have a following in our caucus. None,” she said. “I can’t even think that they think it’s a good idea to say, ‘We have the first woman speaker, and now we’re going to say we’re not going to do that.’”\n\nThose are fighting words in a Democratic Party that seems increasingly torn between a political approach dominated by identity versus one defined by economics. Could taking on Pelosi hurt Ryan with Democratic women if he runs for president in 2020?\n\nRyan waves off the question. “My opposition to Nancy Pelosi has nothing to do with her. We’re down 1,000 state legislative seats [since 2009]. We lost 68 seats in Congress [between 2009 and 2015]. We keep losing. And, on behalf of women, on behalf of people of color, on behalf of working-class whites and immigrants — we need to win. We have a moral obligation to win, and we’re not.”\n\nAs identity’s importance grows in politics, Ryan’s trying to straddle at least two worlds in the Democrats’ fraying coalition. He sells meditation to the working class with appeals to star-athlete yogis, mentally disciplined Navy SEALs and veterans soothing their PTSD.\n\nBut what about the other way around?\n\nIn the Trump era, Democratic primary voters may not be interested in a Rust Belt-based white guy who hasn’t given up on winning over Trump voters. If the wellness vote or yoga vote is more deep-blue, professional and feminine than the hard-hat vote, can Ryan get the mindful to keep an open mind?\n\n“I would hope that people who are spending time calming themselves down, taking care of themselves, would be slightly less judgmental,” Ryan says, and “at least open their hearts up to understanding why some of these folks voted for Trump. Obviously, something was going wrong. Obviously, they wanted something different.”\n\nErick Trickey is a writer in Boston.", "clickbait": null}
