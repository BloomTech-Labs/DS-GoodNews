Moore, sexually assaulted her when she was 14, nearly four decades ago.

After being approached by a Washington Post reporter, she agreed to tell her story, and later said, \u201cIf anything, this has cost me.\u201d\n\nBut negative consequences are not the only thing to keep victims from coming forward. Experts point to a more fundamental issue: When the perpetrator is someone they trusted, it can take years for victims even to identify what happened to them as a violation.\n\nReah Bravo, one of several women who say that the broadcast journalist Charlie Rose made unwanted sexual advances while they were working for him, told The Washington Post, \u201cIt has taken 10 years and a fierce moment of cultural reckoning for me to understand these moments for what they were.\u201d\n\nScott Berkowitz, the president of RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, said confusion and self-blame are common: \u201cA lot of people who call the national hotline, one of the first questions they ask is, \u2018Was I raped?\u2019\u201d\n\nOffenders encourage confusion and shame and exploit people\u2019s reluctance to identify themselves as victims. Veronique Valliere, a psychologist who counsels sexual assault perpetrators and victims and consults with the military and law enforcement, said the offenders she treats list two main tactics used to obscure assaults: They camouflage the act as horseplay or humor, or they act as though nothing happened.\n\n\u201cIf they do this enough, the victim can get really confused, like they\u2019re really the bad one for thinking badly about the offender,\u201d she said.\n\nThe victim doesn\u2019t act like one.\n\nA young woman said she was raped in a police van by two New York City officers, Eddie Martins and Richard Hall, in September.

This time, it was for Autumn Scardina, an Arvada woman celebrating her birthday and the seventh anniversary of her gender transition.\n\nThe commission\u2019s June opinion came despite Phillips\u2019 earlier win at the U.S. Supreme Court over his refusal to make a cake for a gay wedding, the lawsuit says.\n\n\u201cThe state of Colorado is ignoring the message of the U.S. Supreme Court by continuing to single out Jack for punishment and to exhibit hostility toward his religious beliefs,\u201d said Kristen Waggoner, legal vice president of Alliance Defending Freedom, the organization representing Phillips.\n\nHowever, the justices\u2019 7-2 decision in the cake maker\u2019s earlier case was a narrow ruling that kept the state\u2019s nondiscrimination laws intact but said the state commission did not appropriately weigh Phillips\u2019 religious rights.\n\nHickenlooper told reporters Wednesday that he was not involved the commission\u2019s most recent ruling, but said the issue is one of the most thorny he has seen during his public service career. He said he expects the issue to return to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe first ruling from the Supreme Court did not address the basic issue,\u201d he said, referring to the religious freedom issue, \u201cand that\u2019s what I think the U.S. Supreme Court will have to address this time.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Rights Commission and attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment Wednesday. Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican, has long been a supporter of the LGBTQ community.\n\nTuesday\u2019s lawsuit reignites years of legal debate over how religious beliefs should be considered under Colorado\u2019s public accommodation law. The 2008 state law forbids businesses from discriminating against customers on a variety of grounds including sexual orientation and gender.\n\nPhillips and his cake shop first made national news in 2012, when he declined to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of his religious objections to same-sex marriage. The years-long legal fight ended at the U.S. Supreme Court this June in a decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy, who has authored a number of landmark rulings expanding gay rights, indicated that the decision was not all-encompassing.\n\nAt the time, observers on both sides of the case said the limited decision meant the broader debate would continue to be litigated.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Scardina, a lawyer, filed a complaint with the commission claiming that the cake shop denied her request for a cake \u2014 blue on the outside and pink on the inside to represent her transition.\n\nA store employee declined the request because the custom cake would have expressed messages about sex and gender identity that conflict with Phillips\u2019 religious beliefs, according to Scardina\u2019s complaint with the Civil Rights Commission.\n\n\u201cThe woman on the phone did not object to my request for a birthday cake until I told her I was celebrating my transition from male to female,\u201d Scardina wrote in her complaint. \u201cI believe that I was not allowed to order a birthday cake because I requested that its colors celebrate my transition.\u201d\n\nScardina on Wednesday did not return requests to comment.\n\nIn a June 28 decision letter, the commission wrote that there was probable cause to believe Masterpiece violated a state law by denying Scardina \u201cequal enjoyment of a place of public accommodation.\u201d The letter ordered the bakery and Scardina to attempt an amicable resolution by compulsory mediation, according to Phillips\u2019 legal team.\n\nJim Campbell, another lawyer for Phillips, said in a statement that Phillips shouldn\u2019t have to fear government hostility when he opens his shop for business each day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking the court to put a stop to that,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThe arbitrary basis on which the state is applying its law makes clear that its officials are targeting Jack because they despise his religious beliefs and practices.\u201d\n\nOne Colorado, the state\u2019s largest LGBTQ advocacy organization, said the new lawsuit was one of several filed in an effort to legalize discrimination.\n\n\u201cAll people \u2014 including LGBTQ people \u2014 deserve to be served equally in public spaces, and no religious belief gives anyone the right to pick and choose whom they serve and what laws they want to follow,\u201d Daniel Ramos, One Colorado\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cThis is another attempt by the ADF to undermine laws that protect Coloradans in the areas of public accommodations, employment, and housing.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the state\u2019s civil rights commission became a political flashpoint during the state\u2019s regular legislative session. Some conservative lawmakers attempted to shut down the commission in part because of its role in the Masterpiece cake controversy.\n\nUltimately, Hickenlooper signed a bipartisan compromise that extended the commission through 2027 and changed the makeup of the commission, requiring it be more bipartisan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the governor denounced discrimination, saying \u201cit\u2019s not what America stands for.\u201d He also stressed that he understood the value of a person\u2019s religion freedom.\n\n\u201cThis is a difficult question. When you\u2019re talking about people\u2019s religion, it doesn\u2019t matter what religion, it\u2019s one of the most tightly held American freedoms that we have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s why millions of people fought and lost their lives.\u201d", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:14:56.148594"}, {"id": "bc4e5a23d390ba893a20a5a5c2501abe8c06e327", "name": "Ex-Louisiana cadet accused of blackmailing former Army co-worker with lewd photos, police say", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/09/18/ex-louisiana-cadet-accused-blackmailing-former-army-co-worker-with-lewd-photos-police-say.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "A former Louisiana State Police Department cadet was arrested after he tried to blackmail a former Army coworker by forwarding lewd photographs to the victim's employer, police said.", "keywords": ["cadet", "say", "photos", "army", "blackmailing", "kassis", "coworker", "images", "warrant", "accused", "exlouisiana", "reported", "victims", "state", "louisiana", "obtained", "lewd"], "summary": "A former Louisiana State Police Department cadet was arrested after he tried to blackmail a former Army co-worker by forwarding lewd photographs to the victim's employer, police said.\nEX-OKLAHOMA STATE SENATOR GETS 15-YAER PRISON SENTENCE FOR CHILD SEX TRAFFICKINGWhile Kassis was employed by the U.S. Army, state police said he sent nude images of his co-worker to that person\u2019s Army general in February.\nPolice said Kassis intended to send the lewd images to the victim\u2019s other employer in a bid to blackmail his co-worker.\nKassis started the Louisiana State Police Training Academy on May 27, WAFB reported.\nLouisiana State Police investigators obtained search warrants on Kassis\u2019 cell phone and home in Thibodaux.", "content": "A former Louisiana State Police Department cadet was arrested after he tried to blackmail a former Army co-worker by forwarding lewd photographs to the victim's employer, police said.\n\nJimmy Kassis, 26, of Thibodaux, was booked Friday on nonconsensual disclosure of a private image.\n\nEX-OKLAHOMA STATE SENATOR GETS 15-YAER PRISON SENTENCE FOR CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING\n\nWhile Kassis was employed by the U.S. Army, state police said he sent nude images of his co-worker to that person\u2019s Army general in February.

Dale Wood, who has lived on the property about 47 years, and his wife, Angie Wood, said their home was also flooded by the nearby Little River after Matthew, but not nearly to the same levels. (Via OlyDrop) (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nProsperous, vibrant Wilmington opened distribution centers for food, water and tarps Tuesday as officials in the North Carolina city struggled to feed a population cut off by the historic floods of once-mighty Hurricane Florence.\n\nThe Cape Fear River, normally a tourist attraction and economic boon, has brought the city of 120,000 to its knees. Residents who didn't flee before Florence hit last week are now reliant on essentials rolling in on high-water trucks and helicopters.\n\nThe river, expected to crest in Wilmington on Tuesday, set a record Monday when it reached 22.54 feet in the town of Burgaw, 25 miles to the north.\n\n\"The river will continue to rise in the coming days,\" the National Weather Service said. \"Stay safe, river flooding is still a major concern!\"\n\nThe storm has been blamed for at least 32 deaths since it rolled up on the coast of North Carolina last week.

Wilmington's total was about 2 feet. The combination of high winds and surge from the initial impact of the storm, plus the rain, has paralyzed the city. Most homes and businesses have no power, and most traffic lights aren't working.\n\nThe city welcomed 20 high-water trucks from Fort Bragg, packed with enough food and water for 60,000 people for four days. But access to the city remained limited. Stores and gas stations were running out of essentials.\n\nResidents lined up for hours for ice at The Rose Ice and Coal Co. Desperate for gas to run a generator at his home, Nick Monroe waited in a half-mile-long line at a local station that ran out.\n\nHis power went off Thursday before Florence hit the coast, but he couldn\u2019t recall exactly when.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all kind of a blur,\u201d Monroe said.\n\nMore than a dozen North Carolina rivers are likely to crest in major flood stage this week, and damage is widespread.\n\nIn Morehead City, almost 100 miles northwest of Wilmington, the owners of Seaport Antiques returned from a trip to Europe to discover the store they've owned for 32 years in shambles. Don and Nell Thompson found a soupy, crunchy mess of glass, rainwater, ceiling tiles, insulation, baseball cards, broken furniture and shattered ceramics.\n\nCLOSE The North Carolina Division of Aviation flew over Interstate 40 to illustrate how dangerous traveling in that area would be. Both sides are completely impassable after Florence brought heavy rain and deep flood waters.

Still wet and wild, Florence was slamming Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York with heavy rain. Flash flooding was a concern across much of the Carolinas and parts of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and New England.\n\nMore: Tropical Storm Florence: Here's how you can help\n\nMore: After Florence: Your house has flooded.

Hide Caption 60 of 60\n\nFor the first time since Florence ravaged North Carolina, residents in the island town of Wrightsville Beach are allowed to return homes Tuesday.\n\nBut it will be a while before life gets back to normal. A curfew will be in place from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., and access to the nearest big city on the mainland -- Wilmington -- is still greatly hampered.\n\n\"While the island itself did not sustain severe damage, at this time most roads leading to the Wilmington area are impassable due to flooding,\" the town's website says.\n\nFlooding so bad, the river gauge broke\n\nIn North Carolina, cities such as Wilmington and Lumberton are bracing for more flooding.\n\nWilmington was the epicenter of Florence's destruction. Rainfall totals of 26.58 inches have submerged much of the city, effectively cutting it off from the rest of the state.\n\nBut by Tuesday morning, a bit of good news: Two roadways previously blocked are now passable, Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo said. Eastbound I-40 at Exit 73 and westbound US 421 at Exit 385 are now open.\n\nIn Lumberton, where residents scrambled to plug the levee system , parts of Interstate 95 will remain closed until the Lumber River drops below 21 feet. That might not happen until next week, said Corey Walters, Lumberton's deputy director of public works.\n\nBut it's impossible to say how deep the Lumber River is now, because the official river gauge stopped working a few days ago. Walters estimated the current depth is about 25 feet.\n\n- About 1,000 road closures\n\n- No safe/reliable route for public to/from Wilmington\n\n- Sections of I-95/40 flooded. No reopen time at this time.\n\n- Avoid areas S of US 64/east of I-73/I-74\n\n- https://t.co/Pbux7IDYBi: Use route dropdown\n\n(\ud83d\udcf7 @NCAviation; I-95 exits 17-19/Lumberton) pic.twitter.com/YMlKxnfPal \u2014 NCDOT (@NCDOT) September 18, 2018\n\nHigh waters have kept even FEMA crews and Duke Energy trucks away.\n\nWilmington will have its wettest year in the city's 140 years of record-keeping. More than 86 inches of rain have fallen so far. On average, Wilmington gets about 43 inches by this time of the year.\n\nMore than a dozen tornadoes strike Virginia\n\nBefore Florence sputters out for good, it also struck Virginia with a litany of tornadoes. An estimated 15 to 20 tornadoes touched down in at least six counties Monday, the state's Department of Emergency Management Joint Information Center said.\n\nOne tornado caused the first Florence-related death in Virginia when a building collapsed in Chesterfield County south of Richmond.\n\nVideo captures tornado tear apart Chesterfield buildings https://t.co/8Htcv88isp pic.twitter.com/VJtiTDyALB \u2014 WTVR CBS 6 Richmond (@CBS6) September 17, 2018\n\nChesterfield Fire and EMS spokesman Lt.

Water was inches away from the door at Duplicates INK, but that didn't stop Cassidy or his employees.\n\nThe owner of Duplicates INK, a printing company in South Carolina, said the business kept operating.\n\nThey were trying to get one last big order out before the water moved in, and they put sandbags around the biggest, most expensive pieces of equipment hoping to safeguard them.\n\n\"It just makes you realize how vulnerable we all are,\" Cassidy said.\n\n\"I've accepted it, my building is gonna be flooded. We're just going to deal with what we have to deal with and be as tough as we can be and move through it. It sucks.\"\n\nCassidy said he continued working because he made commitments to his customers, and because 10 families rely on paychecks from the business.\n\n\"We can't just shut the door down,\" he said.\n\nCassidy plans to relocate his staff to a building in downtown Conway, CNN affiliate WBTW reported. He said several competitors and friends will help fill the company's orders for them.\n\n33 deaths now linked to Florence\n\nOf the 33 storm-related deaths, at least 26 were in North Carolina, six were in South Carolina and one was in Virginia. They include:\n\n\u2022 A 3-month-old who died when a tree fell on a mobile home in Dallas, North Carolina.\n\n\u2022 One-year-old Kaiden Lee-Welch, who was swept away by rushing waters Sunday and later found dead in Union County, North Carolina.\n\n\u2022 An elderly Union County man whose body was found in his submerged car.\n\n\u2022 Three people who died in flash flooding or \"swift water on roads\" in Duplin County, North Carolina.\n\n\u2022 A woman who went into cardiac arrest in Pender County, North Carolina. When emergency responders tried to reach her, their path was blocked by fallen trees.\n\n\u2022 An 81-year-old man who fell and struck his head while packing to evacuate in Wayne County, North Carolina.\n\nFlorence's finale: Heavy rainfall in the Northeast\n\n#Florence isn't finished just yet, but check out this 4-day #GOESEast timelapse of the storm.

Farmers and manufacturers are also expecting additional lost sales, contributing to mounting pushback against the president\u2019s trade policies.\n\n\u201cEvery time this trade war escalates, the risk to U.S. consumers grows,\u201d National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay said following the tariff order Monday.\n\nWith orders already onboard ships headed to U.S. ports, retailers like Walmart and Target who source heavily from China will face the additional 10 percent tariff on many imported items starting next Monday. That tax will rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1, making it increasingly hard for stores to avoid passing the costs onto their customers.\n\nThe products include canned mandarin oranges, rawhide for pets, hair-care products, dog leashes and dog collars, luggage, handbags, wrapping paper, gas grills, makeup mirrors, vacuum cleaners, toothbrush replacement heads, razors, air conditioners, futons, patio furniture, wooden furniture and mattresses among others, according to a list released by the administration earlier this year.\n\n\n\nAs expected, Beijing on Tuesday met Trump\u2019s move by announcing plans to slap duties on another $60 billion worth of U.S. exports. That in turn is expected to prompt Trump to target another $267 billion worth of Chinese goods, as he warned Monday night he would do.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

They will create uncertainty in the market. They will have ripple effects, second, third, fourth order effects in the economy.\u201d\n\nBut he also called on China to jump start its stalled reform process by more quickly following through on promises made six years ago at the 18th Communist Party Congress and by much more generously implementing its World Trade Organization commitments.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time for gradual reform. Now is the time for a sense of urgency, real negotiations and real market-oriented reform in China,\u201d Allen said.\n\nIn one sign of how Trump\u2019s presidency has changed the environment in China, U.S. companies doing business there listed U.S.-China trade tensions as their top concern in the USCBC\u2019s annual survey in June, a sharp jump from eighth place in 2017.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin invited Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to Washington for a new round of talks. Trump\u2019s decision to proceed with more tariffs appears likely to nix that possibility. However, Treasury officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nWhile many in Congress and the business community agree that China\u2019s industrial policies pose a major challenge for the United States, they disagree with his unilateral use of tariffs to try to force Beijing to make reforms to its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d program aimed at dominating key sectors like artificial intelligence, robotics and driverless cars.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration seems to have just one play in its playbook: slap tariffs to raise prices on an ever growing list of products used by American consumers and hope China blinks first,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee said in a statement. \u201cI am increasingly concerned that the administration\u2019s tactics have yet to produce any real change in behavior in China, and are only creating chaos for American businesses, workers, and consumers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans stepped up their calls for Trump and Xi to meet face to face as soon as possible, although the only opportunity currently on the horizon is a G-20 leaders summit at the end of November in Argentina.\n\n\u201cAny time tariffs are imposed I worry that Americans will be forced to pay extra costs \u2014 in this case on nearly half of U.S. imports from China,\u201d House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said. \u201cI continue to emphasize that the ultimate means to create an effective outcome is for President Trump and President Xi to engage constructively to develop a long-term and profound solution that levels the playing field for American manufacturers, farmers and workers.\u201d\n\nTrump himself referred to that possibility in his statement announcing the tariffs. \u201cOnce again, I urge China\u2019s leaders to take swift action to end their country\u2019s unfair trade practices. Hopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection,\u201d he said.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:00.890785"}, {"id": "acb2a7b26f2cc276c81cec00e40d399b08fde56e", "name": "Trump to visit North Carolina this week", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/trump-hurricane-florence-visit-828011", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "Hurricane Florence hit North and South Carolina on Friday, leading to the deaths of 33 people.", "keywords": ["carolina", "florence", "visit", "trump", "incredible", "south", "politico", "sign", "week", "president", "north"], "summary": "25 people have died in North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Florence.\n| Joe Raedle/Getty Images Trump to visit North Carolina this weekPresident Donald Trump will visit North Carolina Wednesday following major flooding caused by Hurricane Florence, the White House said Tuesday.\nHurricane Florence hit North and South Carolina on Friday, leading to the deaths of 33 people \u2014 25 in North Carolina, six in South Carolina and one in Virginia.\nNorth Carolina Gov.\nThe president during a press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda praised the recovery efforts underway, saying \"tremendous effort and bravery is being shown in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia.\"", "content": "U.S. Army Spc.

Nita Lowey joined the Democratic leadership in 2001, becoming the first woman to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. | Alex Edelman/Getty Images\n\nNita Lowey, Appropriations Committee\n\nIn its 153-year history, the House Appropriations Committee has never had a woman in charge. Lowey wants to change that.\n\nThe New York Democrat got her start in politics in the mid-1970s thanks to her neighbor, future New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and she was first elected to Congress in 1988. Lowey is a close ally of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.); Pelosi\u2019s support helped Lowey rise to ranking member on Appropriations six years ago. Lowey joined the Democratic leadership in 2001, becoming the first woman to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nLowey is liberal on domestic issues, but a foreign-policy moderate and big Israel supporter. She backed the 2002 Iraq War resolution, for instance.\n\nLowey has strongly resisted GOP efforts to cut social spending while boosting the Pentagon budget. In the 1990s, Lowey appeared at a congressional hearing with Bert and Ernie of \"Sesame Street\" after Republican leaders had threatened to kill the Public Broadcasting Service. She also has defended the National Endowment for the Arts. As ranking member on the Appropriations panel, Lowey backs increased federal investments in biomedical research on diseases at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nA moderate and member of the New Democrat Coalition, Rep. Adam Smith has been hawkish on defense issues. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nAdam Smith, Armed Services Committee\n\nAt 53, this lawmaker from Washington state is one of the younger potential Democratic committee chairmen. Smith was elected to Congress in 1996, when he was all of 31, so he\u2019s an old Capitol Hill hand. Smith took over as ranking member on Armed Services following the Democratic wipeout in 2010, and he has continued the bipartisan work of the panel.\n\nSmith grew up in the Seattle-Tacoma area. His father, an airport worker, died when Smith was a teenager, and Smith\u2019s family went on welfare. Smith loaded UPS trucks to help pay his way through college. While in law school at the University of Washington, Smith was elected to the Washington state Senate. Six years later, Smith won his first race for Congress.\n\nA moderate and member of the New Democrat Coalition, Smith has been hawkish on defense issues. Smith initially supported the Iraq War, although he later turned against President George W. Bush\u2019s handling of the conflict. On Afghanistan, Smith backed President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of that country, yet he had previously supported efforts to remain \u201cengaged\u201d in the conflict. Smith was in favor of the Obama-era Iran deal and requested funding for refugee resettlement in the United States. Smith gets financial backing from major defense contractors, as well as unions that represent defense-industry employees.\n\nSmith is being challenged from the left this cycle \u2014 as he was in 2016 \u2014 but is expected to easily win reelection in November.\n\nAs chairman of the panel\u2019s Health subcommittee during the 111th Congress, Rep.

First elected to the Long Beach City Council in 1982, by the following year, Pallone had become a member of the New Jersey state Senate. In 1988, Pallone was elected to Congress.\n\nAs chairman of the panel\u2019s Health subcommittee during the 111th Congress, Pallone had a role in crafting Obamacare. More recently, he has co-authored legislation to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act and focused on fighting the opioid epidemic in New Jersey.\n\nA major focus for Pallone \u2014 and all House Democrats \u2014 will be trying to lower prescription drug prices. That\u2019s a big employer back home in the Garden State, but Pallone and other Democrats have vowed to take action on this issue.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters wants to protect and strengthen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and curb predatory lending practices that harm students and veterans. | Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Families Belong Together LA\n\nMaxine Waters, Financial Services Committee\n\nWaters has become a liberal icon \u2014 and, in Trump\u2019s eyes, a leader of the Democratic Party. That\u2019s not a compliment for Trump. \u201cAuntie Maxine\u201d has screamed impeachment early and often throughout the Trump presidency, prompting his frequent attacks on her intelligence.\n\nWaters has long generated controversy and headlines. She gained national attention even before winning election to Congress in 1990 for her no-nonsense brand of politics in the California State Assembly, where she served as Democratic Caucus chair.\n\nAs a member of Congress, Waters represents a large chunk of South Central Los Angeles. She wants to protect and strengthen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and curb predatory lending practices that harm students and veterans.\n\nWaters faced serious ethics problems following the 2008 financial crisis. The California Democrat was accused of improperly intervening on behalf of a minority-owned bank for which her husband had served on the board of directors and held a large block of stock. Waters adamantly denied any wrongdoing and the case was eventually dismissed. Now, Waters is on the verge of becoming the first chairwoman in Financial Services Committee history.\n\nRep.

Solis/AP Photo\n\nBennie Thompson, Homeland Security Committee\n\nThompson, 70, is the longest-serving black elected official in Mississippi and its House delegation\u2019s lone Democrat. Thompson came to Congress in 1993 after winning a special election to succeed former Rep. Mike Espy (D-Miss.), who was appointed secretary of the Department of Agriculture by President Bill Clinton. Thompson is the only Democrat to chair the Homeland Security Committee; he led the panel in 2007 until becoming ranking member in 2011. As chairman again, Thompson would prioritize defense against election interference and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThompson attended Tougaloo, a private historically black college, in Jackson. As a student, he championed civil rights through the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and organized voter registration drives for black voters in the Mississippi Delta. Thompson then became a teacher before jumping into politics. He was alderman and mayor of his hometown, Bolton, and Hinds County supervisor. Thompson is a vocal Trump critic, and he called on the president to resign last week following Trump\u2019s false claim that nearly 3,000 people didn\u2019t die in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria.\n\nWith the Homeland Security gavel in Thompson\u2019s hand, the White House can expect extensive oversight over Trump\u2019s border wall project, ICE and immigrant detention programs.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff supports America\u2019s membership in multilateral groups like NATO and the United Nations. | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo\n\nAdam Schiff, House Intelligence Committee\n\nSchiff, 58, is the top Democrat on the Select Committee on Intelligence, which has conducted a fight-marred investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Schiff is a former federal prosecutor who studied political science at Stanford and attended Harvard Law School. He prosecuted the first FBI agent to be indicted for espionage.\n\nSchiff was first elected to Congress in 2000 after serving a four-year term in the California state Senate. He\u2019s a leader on national security in Congress who opposes a unilateralist approach to foreign policy. Schiff supports America\u2019s membership in multilateral groups like NATO and the United Nations. He also considers climate change a national security threat.\n\nRelations between Schiff and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the committee chairman, have broken down over Trump and Russia, plunging what was once a notably bipartisan committee into unending partisan squabbles. That\u2019s unlikely to change if Schiff becomes chairman come January.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler has a long history opposing expanded police and executive-branch powers. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nJerry Nadler, Judiciary Committee\n\nNadler, 71, was elected to Congress in 1992 after serving 16 years in the New York State Assembly. He represents one of the nation\u2019s most diverse districts, New York\u2019s 10th Congressional District, which includes Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, SoHo, Wall Street and some neighborhoods in Brooklyn.\n\nNadler has a long history opposing expanded police and executive-branch powers. He voted against the PATRIOT Act, and he has cosponsored legislation such as the End Racial Profiling Act to curb discriminatory treatment of minorities by law enforcement. He spoke out on the high-profile deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two African-American men who were killed by police officers in 2014. Nadler was a strong backer of gay rights.\n\nNadler talked openly about impeaching President George W. Bush but has been far more cautious about the issue since he took over as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee last year following the resignation of longtime Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), who departed amid a sexual harassment scandal.\n\nBlunt and outspoken, Rep. Elijah Cummings will be aggressive in investigating Trump administration scandals, just as Republicans were under former President Barack Obama. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nElijah Cummings, Oversight and Government Reform Committee\n\nThe 67-year-old Cummings is likely to become a major irritant for Trump and White House officials in the event of a Democratic takeover of the House. Blunt and outspoken, the Maryland Democrat will be aggressive in investigating Trump administration scandals, just as Republicans were under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe son of sharecroppers who left the South for Baltimore when he was young, Cummings attended Howard University, and then received a law degree from the University of Maryland. Cummings was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1982, rising to speaker pro tem. He was first elected to Congress in a 1996 special election. Cummings flirted with a possible Senate run following the retirement of Democrat Barbara Mikulski in 2016, but he decided to stay in the House.\n\nCummings says he has a \u201ctwo-lane process\u201d in mind if he becomes chairman. First, Cummings says he will focus on \u201cDefend the democracy\u201d issues such as voting rights, Trump\u2019s cancellation of security clearances for his critics, the 2020 Census, the rights of federal employees, and the president\u2019s treatment of the press. Secondly, Cummings wants to push reform proposals, including overhauling the U.S. Postal Service, as well as oversight for the drug industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for retribution,\u201d Cummings insists. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the truth.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim McGovern got a seat on Rules thanks in part to Rep. Joe Moakley\u2019s help, and he has risen up the ranks of the panel. | Alex Edelman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJim McGovern, Rules Committee\n\nThis committee is how the speaker controls the floor. And if Democrats win the House, McGovern will be the person wielding the gavel of this panel on Pelosi\u2019s behalf.\n\nMcGovern, 58, grew up in Worcester, Mass., where his parents owned a liquor store. He attended American University in Washington, and while in graduate school, began working for the Democratic Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota (no relation). Jim McGovern was later an aide to former Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.), a one-time Rules Committee chairman.\n\nMcGovern ran for Congress in 1994 and lost, but he won a House seat in 1996. McGovern got a seat on Rules thanks in part to Moakley\u2019s help, and he has risen up the ranks of the panel. When Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) died earlier this year, McGovern became ranking Democrat on Rules.\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio said he wants some answers from the General Services Administration on Trump\u2019s lease for the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Ave. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nPeter DeFazio, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee\n\nA major infrastructure package is something that both parties say they want to enact. This Oregon Democrat believes he could deliver on that, although he also wants to conduct \u201cserious oversight\u201d of the Trump White House, especially the Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House.\n\nThe 71-year-old DeFazio is a charter member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He supports higher taxes on the wealthy, and he\u2019d like to crack down on Wall Street as well, which he sees as a major cause of the boom-and-bust economic cycle. He\u2019s long opposed free-trade deals, which he believes hurt workers. Yet DeFazio supports a balanced-budget amendment, and voted against the 2009 economic stimulus bill because it didn\u2019t go far enough in his view.\n\nDeFazio was born in Massachusetts but moved to Oregon for graduate school, became a bike mechanic, then landed a job on the staff of former Democratic Rep. Jim Weaver. When Weaver retired in 1986, DeFazio won his seat, and he\u2019s been a fixture on Capitol Hill ever since.\n\nDeFazio said he\u2019s eager to work with Trump on a major infrastructure package, but in addition, he wants some answers from the General Services Administration on Trump\u2019s lease for the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Ave. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten satisfactory answers regarding the Trump Hotel from the GSA. They refused to provide documents to Democrats,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cWhen I am chairman, they will provide the documents to me.\u201d\n\nRep. Richard Neal strongly opposed the Trump tax-cut package. | Toya Samo Jordan/Getty Images\n\nRichie Neal, Ways and Means Committee\n\nNeal has spent 25 years on the Ways and Means Committee out of his three decades in Congress, and the brass ring is finally in sight. What the Massachusetts lawmaker will be able to do there is a big question if Republicans still control the Senate and White House.\n\nNeal\u2019s parents died when he was young, and Neal and his sisters received Social Security survivor benefit checks. Those checks helped pay for Neal to attend American International College in Springfield, Massachusetts. He later received a master\u2019s degree in public administration from the University of Hartford. By the mid-1980s, Neal was mayor of Springfield, and he won a seat in Congress in 1988.\n\nNeal, 69, strongly opposed the Trump tax-cut package, and he\u2019ll likely try to roll back some of that if he becomes chairman, although Neal will have a hard time doing so while Trump is in the Oval Office.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat has been a moderate on trade, even though his party has moved hard left on the issue. He has pushed hard for legislation to block \u201cinversions,\u201d when U.S. companies incorporate in tax havens overseas to reduce their tax bill.

Justice Thomas was accused of sexually harassing Ms. Hill in the workplace but not physically assaulting her. He was a senior official at two government agencies at the time of the alleged behavior, and she was his subordinate. Judge Kavanaugh is accused of pinning Dr. Blasey to a bed, groping her, trying to remove her clothes and covering her mouth with his hand to muffle her screams while drunk at a party during high school. He was about 17 at the time, and she was about 15.\n\nNeither Ms. Hill nor Dr. Blasey reported the episodes to the authorities at the time, but what has changed since 1991 is the default setting.

If the party is about to have a potentially divisive internal conversation over issues like immigration enforcement, culture, identity and even the sustainability of capitalism, it would do well to proceed with caution.\n\nOr, better yet, it could learn from its history.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe issues that divide this year\u2019s insurgents from the party\u2019s establishment ought to sound familiar, because they are variations on themes that divided Democrats a hundred years ago\u2014divided them, that is, until two New Yorkers, both of them on the verge of national leadership, bridged the chasm, transforming the party and creating a coalition that dominated U.S. politics at the height of the American Century.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, a self-styled progressive reformer, and Al Smith, a proud son of New York\u2019s Tammany Hall political machine, represented factions that had little to say to each other during the party\u2019s long decades in the presidential wilderness after the Civil War. On one side were FDR\u2019s progressives, who would never be confused with the left wing of today\u2019s Democratic Party, save for their shared distaste for political machines. (Yesterday\u2019s progressives tended to be well-born and well-educated, obsessed with issues like temperance, cultural conformity, laissez-faire economics and moral uplift for the poor. Many disdained hyphenated identities and saw national decline and cultural degradation written in the ledgers kept on Ellis Island, leading to passage of immigration restrictions in 1924.)\n\nOn the other side of the Democratic Party were urban liberals, based in the immigrant wards of the urban northwest and Midwest. These Democrats saw many progressive concerns, particularly Prohibition and high-minded political reforms such as primary elections and civil service tests, as hostile commentaries on their culture, values and leaders.\n\nThe result of this disagreement was disarray and decades of rejection at the ballot box, at least at the presidential level. Democrats elected Grover Cleveland, a reformer who saw little role for government in regulating the economy, twice during the Gilded Age and managed to sneak in Woodrow Wilson, the personification of elite progressivism, in 1912 only because Theodore Roosevelt split the Republican vote with his Bull Moose challenge to William Howard Taft that year. Wilson barely won re-election in 1916, with the outcome hinging on a close vote in California. Amazingly, because of the party\u2019s deep divisions, those were the only Democratic victories between James Buchanan in 1856 and Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.\n\nBut when Roosevelt and Smith brought together the party\u2019s elite progressives and urban liberals during their campaigns for governor of New York and for president, Democrats found a formula that led to a 20-year monopoly on the White House between 1933 and 1953. Today\u2019s Democrats would do well to consider what happens when they focus on building bridges rather than creating divides.\n\n\n\n***\n\nYoung Franklin Roosevelt was elected to New York\u2019s state Senate from the rural Hudson Valley region in 1910 on an explicitly anti-urban, anti-machine platform and he busied himself with traditional progressive causes like political reform (he was an advocate for primary elections) and moral uplift (he supported a ban on playing baseball on Sunday) during his first, brief tenure in Albany.\n\nHis progressivism contained more than a little smugness and self-righteousness. The legendary Albany political boss, Daniel O\u2019Connell, described the young FDR\u2014who as a child traveled the country in his father\u2019s private rail car\u2014as a \u201cpatronizing son of a bitch\u201d who \u201cdidn\u2019t like poor people.\u201d During his time in the state Senate, FDR did little to advance far-reaching social welfare reforms such as greater workplace safety regulations, worker\u2019s compensation and limits on the exploitation of workers. But he was all for taking power away from urban political machines that were the key champions of those pragmatic reforms.\n\nAl Smith was gregarious and unpretentious, capable of winning over political foes with his charm and street-smart intelligence. He delighted in his Irish ancestry and his city upbringing, often reminding colleagues and constituents of the time he spent working at the legendary Fulton Fish Market. He was a grade-school dropout who was mentored by local political bosses and elected to the state Assembly in 1903 at age 29. He taught himself the art of politics, and while the young Roosevelt was trying to make life miserable for Tammany Hall during his short tenure in New York\u2019s state legislature from 1911 to early 1913, Smith transformed himself into an advocate for the poor, for workers, for immigrants, for widows and children. As a legislative leader, he and his close friend state Senator Robert Wagner championed vast social reforms after the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911 that killed more than 140 workers, many of them immigrants or the children of immigrants.\n\nSmith and Roosevelt eyed each other warily, symbols of the party\u2019s seemingly unbridgeable divisions, while they were both in the state Senate. Like so many other Democrats from their respective factions, they had in common only the \u201cD\u201d affixed to their names. \u201cFranklin,\u201d Smith said during those early years, \u201cjust isn\u2019t the sort of man you can take into the pissroom and talk intimately with.\u201d Few thought Smith and Roosevelt would have anything intimate to say to each other regardless of the setting.\n\nBut in 1918, as Smith successfully sought to become the first Catholic elected governor of New York and Roosevelt was serving as assistant secretary of the Navy in President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s administration, the unexpected conversation began.\n\nRoosevelt made the first move, offering to campaign for Smith despite the cultural gulf that divided them. It was no small gesture, for self-styled progressives like those in Wilson\u2019s Washington had only contempt for the ethnic politicians who dominated the party\u2019s ranks in the cities of the north and Midwest.\n\nIt marked the beginning of FDR\u2019s bridge-building project, one that would unite progressives and liberals around the social and economic reforms he would later implement as part of the New Deal.\n\nRoosevelt\u2019s endorsement of Smith came as FDR moved away from the righteous moralism of his brand of progressivism to a more pragmatic understanding of power and government. With its command of retail politics, Tammany Hall was producing people like Smith and Wagner who were winning elections and getting things done, like the social reforms passed after the Triangle fire. Perhaps just as important for the ambitious Roosevelt, it was much easier to win elections as an ally\u2014or at least not an enemy\u2014of Tammany, as he discovered in 1914 when a Tammany candidate trounced him in a primary for U.S. Senate without even campaigning. (The winning candidate, James Gerard, was U.S. ambassador to Germany, and he remained in Berlin during the campaign.)\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt delivers the nominating speech for Al Smith at the Democratic Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York on June 26, 1924. This speech is often considered FDR\u2019s first major gesture of re-entry into national politics after recovering from the onset of polio. | Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library & Museum\n\nSo in 1917, FDR accepted an invitation to speak at Tammany Hall\u2019s annual July 4 commemorations, something that would have been unimaginable a few years earlier, when he referred to Tammany boss Charles Francis Murphy as a \u201cnoxious weed.\u201d The Washington progressives of the Wilson administration and the urban pols gathered at Tammany that day still disagreed profoundly on issues of identity\u2014Wilson himself demanded 100-percent Americanism devoid of hyphenation\u2014and culture. But the conversation was beginning.\n\nSmith, with Roosevelt\u2019s endorsement, went on to win the first of four two-year terms as governor in 1918. To the amazement of progressives who thought he would turn over the state payroll to unqualified hacks, Tammany\u2019s Smith ran a scandal-free administration and supported the beginnings of minimum wage regulations, the creation of vast state parks and the passage of criminal justice and education reforms. Progressive reformers supported these goals as well but they lacked the clout and knowledge to get them passed.\n\nSmith and Roosevelt grew closer during Smith\u2019s first term, and perhaps closer still when they both lost in the Republican tidal wave of 1920\u2014Smith in his bid for re-election, Roosevelt as the Democrats\u2019 nominee for vice president. They wrote each other comforting notes not long after the election, and FDR encouraged Smith to join him in rebuilding the party after its catastrophic losses. In 1924, after reclaiming the governor\u2019s office in Albany, Smith chose Roosevelt to deliver his nominating speech at that year\u2019s Democratic National Convention in Madison Square Garden. Roosevelt, appearing in public for the first time since contracting polio in 1921, famously dubbed Smith \u201cthe happy warrior\u201d in an electrifying speech in which he assured progressives that a Catholic machine politician from the city shared many of their goals if not their background.\n\nFDR\u2019s presence on the Smith team had an element of tokenism to it\u2014a Protestant patrician backing an Irish-Catholic plebian surrounded by other ethnics from the city\u2014but his impact on the contest was significant. Roosevelt might have been expected to support his friend William Gibbs McAdoo, Woodrow Wilson\u2019s son-in-law and onetime Treasury secretary, as the candidate of the elite, reform-minded progressives. Instead, FDR sided with the man who spoke for the new Americans of the 20th century.\n\nSmith and McAdoo\u2014the latter of whom had the support of hundreds of Klansmen who dominated several states\u2019 delegations at the convention\u2014battled each other for 102 ballots before the convention came to an exhausted end on the 103rd with the nomination of a compromise candidate, John Davis, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. The proceedings were judged to be a disaster, and as usual, the Democrats were defeated in that year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (second from left), with George Lunn, John W. Davis and Al Smith (far right) on the porch of the Roosevelt home in Hyde Park, New York, on August 7, 1924. | Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library & Museum\n\nBut through the Smith-Roosevelt alliance, the Democrats caught a glimpse of what could be if they found a way to begin talking with, rather than shouting at, each other. Significant issues remained, not least of them Prohibition, which progressives like McAdoo supported and urban liberals like Smith opposed and defied. Eventually, it was the progressive Roosevelt who would preside over Prohibition\u2019s demise in 1933 and who implemented social reforms stripped of the moralism of elite progressives who preferred to help only those they considered deserving of assistance.\n\nSmith would go on to win the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination in 1928, becoming the first Catholic to lead a major party\u2019s national ticket. He persuaded Roosevelt to run for governor to replace him, a significant concession for a Tammany man raised to regard elite reformers as natural enemies. Smith lost to Republican Herbert Hoover in a landslide, although he became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the nation\u2019s largest cities. Roosevelt held on to win a slim victory in the race for governor that year, setting the stage for his White House run in 1932.\n\nThe story of this single unlikely alliance does not have a happy ending. Smith, who blamed his defeat in 1928 on anti-Catholic bigotry, challenged Roosevelt for the 1932 presidential nomination, which FDR secured with the help of Smith\u2019s enemies, most prominently the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst. Deeply bitter, Smith turned against FDR and his New Deal, campaigning for Roosevelt\u2019s Republican opponents in 1936 and 1940. Roosevelt was understandably puzzled, for he noted that much of the New Deal was foreshadowed by Smith\u2019s policies in New York in the 1920s.\n\nBut even if the personal relationship between FDR and Smith fell apart, it didn\u2019t mean the end of the unity between the progressive and liberal factions they represented. FDR\u2019s victorious coalition in the 1932 presidential election was foreshadowed in Smith\u2019s failed presidential campaign of 1928, which captured the imagination of the nation\u2019s largest cities and their immigrant-stock voters. In addition, Roosevelt won back white Southerners who had rejected Smith because of his religion, his opposition to Prohibition and his city slicker image, and so created an expansive voter base that propelled him to the White House four times. Unless the Constitution\u2019s two-term limit (a reaction to Roosevelt\u2019s dominance) is repealed, nobody will ever repeat FDR\u2019s electoral success.\n\nRoosevelt\u2019s popular response to the Great Depression kept the party united\u2014which, it is important to note, also meant catering to and empowering Southern segregationists. The New Deal coalition went on to dominate U.S. politics from Roosevelt\u2019s first term to the party\u2019s crackup in 1968 and the election of Republican Richard Nixon. Along the way, the laissez-faire approach of Gilded Age Democrats like Grover Cleveland and the elite moralizing of Woodrow Wilson faded and the party presided over a new social contract between government and its citizens, with benefits distributed as an entitlement regardless of the recipient\u2019s moral character.\n\nThere\u2019s no question about which politician benefited the most from the Smith-Roosevelt alliance, which transformed Roosevelt from a Hudson Valley squire into a four-term president.\n\nBut, while FDR might have made it to the White House, it was Smith\u2019s urban liberalism, with its roots in machine politics, that ultimately prevailed over the elite progressivism on which FDR was raised. It took the patrician Roosevelt to sell the country a version of the policies the rough-edged Smith had implemented in New York. FDR was hardly representative of the America of the 1930s, but with his polished demeanor and extraordinary communication skills, he conveyed an empathy that was notably absent in his younger days\u2014when, he admitted later, he was a \u201cmean cuss.\u201d The paralysis of polio surely changed him. But so did his relationship with street-smart politicians like Smith, who knew about inequality and injustice because they experienced it.\n\nAs president, Roosevelt once reminisced about his Albany days with his labor secretary, Frances Perkins, who had been a good-government lobbyist in the capital before going to work for both Smith and FDR. The president recalled a lesson he learned from another rough-and-tumble character like Smith, state Senator Tim Sullivan, who represented the Bowery section of Manhattan and was both a stalwart supporter of social welfare reform and, as a machine politician who undoubtedly had his hand in illegal rackets in his neighborhood, the bane of political reformers like FDR himself.\n\nWhatever Sullivan\u2019s flaws, Roosevelt told Perkins, he understood how politics worked, and how voters should be treated.\n\n\u201cTim Sullivan used to say that the America of the future would be made out of people who had come over in steerage and who knew in their own hearts and lives the difference between being despised and being accepted and liked,\u201d Roosevelt recalled with an affection that the earlier version of himself would have found puzzling.\n\nVoters still know the difference between being despised and being accepted, which is why the young progressives and old-line liberals would do well to build bridges rather than shout at each other from opposite sides of a cultural or ideological chasm.\n\nOh, and they might think twice before calling anybody deplorable.\n\nTerry Golway is a senior editor at POLITICO States responsible for New York state political coverage out of Albany.

But homeowners in inland areas long thought to be safe will be in for a rude awakening.\n\n\u201cThe majority of those people don\u2019t carry flood insurance,\u201d Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator. He said insurance agents and real estate agents have tended to tell people they did not need it.\n\nThe National Flood Insurance Program is expected to pay out $7 billion on claims related to Florence\u2019s flood, more than 10 times the $648.7 million paid after Hurricane Matthew in 2016.\n\nThe agency made $8.7 billion in flood insurance payments after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas last year.\n\nMeteorologists believe that more storms in coming years will mirror Harvey and Florence, slow-moving disasters that flood homes with several feet of rain over days.\n\nThe flooding from these storms shows that regions outside of the riskiest areas designated on flood maps are vulnerable too, Fugate said. Sixteen rivers have hit \u201cmajor flood\u201d levels in North Carolina, the National Weather Service said.\n\nExperts said U.S. government maps that outline so-called \u201cflood zones\u201d were developed to set insurance rates and can mislead homeowners living outside of those regions into not buying flood insurance.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that current flood maps only reflect about one-third of the people who are at significant flood risk.\n\nBut of the 10 top-ranked states where major flood events have occurred in the past 10 years, the top five are land-locked, according to data from Pew, including Oklahoma and Iowa.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common misperception that if you don\u2019t live near the coast and can\u2019t see the waves crashing on the shore, you might not be at risk,\u201d said Forbes Tompkins, a Pew Charitable Trusts expert on flood-prepared infrastructure. \u201cBut where it rains, it can flood.\u201d\n\nJust 134,306 properties in North Carolina and 204,342 in South Carolina are enrolled in the National Flood Insurance Program, according to FEMA. The bulk of those are clustered in coastal communities.\n\nFor those without flood insurance, all they can hope for is federal funding, usually about $30,000, said Ray Lehmann, director of finance, insurance and trade policy at the R Street Institute.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be enough to rebuild an entire home,\u201d he said.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:04.775390"}, {"id": "30a3f860da07d10b4fd0445fd88d296423471e16", "name": "Probe of FEMA chief referred to prosecutors: source", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fema/probe-of-fema-chief-referred-to-prosecutors-source-idUSKCN1LY04C?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T14:40:48+00:00", "description": "A federal probe into whether the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, improperly used his government car to commute from Washington to his home in North Carolina has been referred to prosecutors for possible criminal charges, according to a person familiar with the matter.", "keywords": ["carolina", "prosecutors", "car", "using", "probe", "source", "referred", "chief", "long", "washington", "person", "investigation", "fema", "federal", "north"], "summary": "The person said Long was also under investigation for improperly using motorcades during the drives to North Carolina and putting aides up in hotels.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the department could neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.\nFlorence, which hit the North Carolina coast on Thursday, has killed 23 people and displaced thousands before turning into a slow-moving storm that threatens deeper flooding in the Carolinas.\nLong said in the statement that he would meet with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper on Tuesday to discuss how to help in the storm response and recovery.\nThe Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported about the referral to prosecutors, said Long and two other federal employees may have broken as many as six laws.", "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal probe into whether the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, improperly used his government car to commute from Washington to his home in North Carolina has been referred to prosecutors for possible criminal charges, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nFILE PHOTO: FEMA Administrator Brock Long listens as U.S. President Donald Trump holds an Oval Office meeting on preparations for hurricane Florence at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 11, 2018.

James Michael Johnson (R-La.), one of the lawmakers pushing to overhaul FARA, said in an interview Monday.\n\n\u2014 \u201cJohnson\u2019s proposal and its Senate companion hit roadblocks when they drew opposition from companies based abroad, which feared the changes would force their lobbyists to register as foreign agents \u2014 which would require them to disclose every meeting and phone call they made on behalf of overseas clients \u2014 rather than under the less-restrictive disclosure rules for domestic lobbyists. Dozens of foreign-owned companies have lobbied Congress on the matter in recent months, according to disclosure filings, from the defense contractor BAE Systems to foreign automakers such as Honda and Volkswagen. One company lobbying on the legislation, the medical device firm Medtronic, was headquartered in Minnesota until a few years ago, when it bought an Irish company and moved its headquarters to Dublin as part of a \u2018tax inversion\u2019 that slashed what the combined company paid in U.S. taxes. Medtronic declined to comment.\u201d Full story.\n\n\u2014 Although Congress may not be moving quickly on foreign lobbying reform, an aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said the panel is watching the Justice Department\u2019s investigations into FARA compliance. \"Ideally, the committee would have the benefit of reviewing the final results of these investigations to help inform any potential legislative action in the future,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that people are being prosecuted under the current law.\u201d\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that FARA registrations have gone way up in the last year. In 2017, there were 102 new FARA registrations, compared to 69 in 2016 and 64 in 2015, according to data provided to PI by the Justice Department. So far in 2018, there have been 87 new registrations. In addition, there\u2019s been a surge in advisory opinions for firms trying to comply with FARA.

Ford described in graphic detail being groped decades ago at a high-school party in suburban Washington D.C. by Kavanaugh, who held her down, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth when she tried to scream.\n\nA public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was scheduled for Sept. 24 after Ford, through her attorney, said early Monday she was willing to testify before Congress, as did Kavanaugh, who continued to call the allegations completely false.\n\n\u201cJudge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation,\u201d said White House spokesman Raj Shah.\n\nKavanaugh spent the day at the White House complex in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the team that helped the judge prepare for his confirmation hearings \u2013 former law clerks and staffers from the White House counsel\u2019s office, Office of Legislative Affairs and communications shop \u2013 was busy reconstructing their so-called war room in case he faces another round of public testimony on the Ford accusations.\n\nHe also has retained Washington attorney Beth Wilkinson to represent him, said one person familiar with Kavanaugh\u2019s plans. Wilkinson did not return a call to her office for comment.\n\nThe White House is working to appear open to letting Ford air her claims, with staff and Republicans close to the administration leery of inviting criticism or further firing up female voters before the midterms by attacking the accuser\u2019s credibility, something the president did last year after women stepped forward before Alabama\u2019s special Senate election to accuse Moore of assaulting them decades ago as a local prosecutor in Alabama.\n\nInstead, the White House sent presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway out on television Monday morning to say of Ford: \u201cShe should not be ignored or insulted. She should be heard.\u201d That statement set the tone for the rest of the day, with the president following Conway\u2019s lead.\n\nBut as a Plan B, officials involved in the confirmation process \u2013 and Trump himself \u2013 are raising questions about Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s actions after receiving Ford\u2019s original, anonymous letter, which she held on to for weeks before notifying fellow senators on the Judiciary Committee and referring the matter to the FBI.\n\nAllies of Trump and Kavanaugh outside the White House are engaging in a rougher game. Conservative commentator Laura Ingraham and others circulated a story on Monday that Kavanaugh\u2019s mother, also a judge, had presided over the 1996 foreclosure of a home owned by Ford\u2019s parents \u2013 suggesting revenge as a motive for her accusations.\n\nIn fact, a different judge wrote an order forcing the sale of the couple\u2019s house in August 1996. A few months later, Martha Kavanaugh, then a circuit court judge in Montgomery County, Md., dismissed the case and barred the lender from revisiting the case \u2013 allowing the couple to keep their home.\n\nFord\u2019s lawyer, Debra Katz, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt stake in Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation is a key swing vote on the Supreme Court that could ultimately decide the fate of abortion rights, environmental regulations, Obamacare, labor laws, gun rights, freedom of speech and the role of religion in society.\n\nThe Trump White House and Senate leadership very much wanted to complete the confirmation process by October, seating Kavanaugh ahead of the midterms as a selling point to Republican voters.\n\nThe White House has no intention of withdrawing Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination and continues to prep for a committee vote on his nomination, originally slated for this Thursday, according to six officials familiar with the confirmation process and Republicans close to the White House. That would change only if new evidence is uncovered, or if other witnesses emerge to corroborate Ford\u2019s account, these people said.\n\nIf that happens, these people said, Trump\u2019s calculus might quickly change \u2013 despite the millions of dollars that have already been spent to support Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, not to mention the political capital of several powerful conservative groups including the Judicial Crisis Network and the Federalist Society. The Judicial Crisis Network also announced on Monday that it planned to spend $1.5 million on a new TV ad campaign to bolster Kavanaugh\u2019s prospects.\n\nTwo women whom Kavanaugh dated in high school and college also came forward with statements to speak highly of his character.\n\nFor now, the White House is hoping that Kavanaugh can \u201csqueak\u201d through the confirmation process, as another Republican close to the White House put it \u2013 and it is largely putting that onus on the Senate to give the administration some distance from its success or failure.\n\n\u201cCan allegations that can never be proven true or false with an incident over 36 years ago destroy a man\u2019s otherwise unblemished personal record? Everyone will have to see how it unfolds,\u201d said a Republican familiar with the confirmation process.\n\nLorraine Woellert contributed to this report.\n\n", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:06.156409"}, {"id": "8338a529ad4818995eb9302a9c5010d5200f31ea", "name": "Mom jailed after she and infant found riding with teen accused of driving drunk, cops say", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/09/18/mom-jailed-after-and-infant-found-riding-with-teen-accused-driving-drunk-cops-say.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "A young Wisconsin mother was jailed after she and her 5-month-old baby were found in a car driven by a drunken 15-year-old, police said.", "keywords": ["riding", "say", "infant", "jailed", "car", "mom", "15yearold", "teen", "drunk", "passenger", "accused", "cops", "baby", "vehicle", "young", "villarrealtellez", "driving", "driver"], "summary": "A young Wisconsin mother was jailed after she and her 5-month-old baby were found in a car driven by a drunken 15-year-old, police said.\nOfficers in Mount Pleasant spotted the vehicle traveling around 25 miles per hour over the speed limit late Sunday after getting a call from a witness who claimed to have seen the teen driver swerving and driving into oncoming traffic, WITI reports.\nProsecutors say Villarreal-Tellez \u2013 who is facing a child neglect charge \u2013 couldn\u2019t stand straight and was speaking incoherently with officers at the scene.\nThe teen who was driving reportedly failed a sobriety test and was charged with OWI 1st with a passenger under the age of 16, before he was released back to his parents.\nThe other passenger was cited for underage drinking and the toddler was given to Villarreal-Tellez\u2019s grandparents, WDJT reported.", "content": "A young Wisconsin mother was jailed after she and her 5-month-old baby were found in a car driven by a drunken 15-year-old, police said.\n\nOfficers in Mount Pleasant spotted the vehicle traveling around 25 miles per hour over the speed limit late Sunday after getting a call from a witness who claimed to have seen the teen driver swerving and driving into oncoming traffic, WITI reports.\n\nAfter the car stopped at a gas station, police approached it and found 19-year-old Adela Villarreal-Tellez, the 15-year-old driver and another teen \u2013 all intoxicated -- inside the vehicle, while the baby boy was in the back seat, Sgt.

On the opposite side are the legendary Comanche, fighting Washington\u2019s armies. It will all land next in the grandly marbled, federal courthouse in Denver \u2014 home to the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and Neil Gorsuch before he moved up to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThere, amid the inscribed names of Pony Express riders, this same appellate court shook up all of Oklahoma just last year on a separate Indian law case. And come September 26, the Comanche will make oral arguments in a precedent-setting lawsuit against the Interior Department.\n\nWhat triggered this fight is a new Red River Chickasaw casino, which Interior approved last year with no notice to the Comanche, whose ancestral lands are just miles away. Blindsided, the Comanche hope to turn the tables by using a landmark 2012 Supreme Court decision to challenge the department\u2019s actions under the Administrative Procedure Act. The suit seeks to build on the past decade of cases in which top federal judges have seemed to supersede Congress in altering old concepts of Indian law.\n\nThis account draws on court filings, interviews and internal government documents released to POLITICO under the Freedom of Information Act. The record shows what appear to be major flaws in the review process, but after inviting written questions, Interior abruptly cut off any answers last week, citing the pending litigation.\n\nLike all classic Westerns, what emerges most is a story about survival and the search for some measure of rough justice. The inequities are as stark as any tale of cattle barons in the past. And the fight brings to the surface years of resentment over how Washington treats the poorer Plains tribes of western Oklahoma versus the more powerful Five Civilized Tribes in the east.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

New injustices followed when their Oklahoma lands were next divvied up under an allotment system that was disastrous to Native Americans across the nation. But the Five retained a precious independence that allowed them to escape the federally-imposed tribal constitutions and blood quantum rules that would long shackle many western tribes.\n\nSince passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act 30 years ago, these advantages have proved crucial.\n\nIn a modern Oklahoma lands rush, the Five were quick to secure dozens of trust agreements, allowing them to open casinos at choice locations with minimal federal review. This gives then a 70 percent market share today and insurmountable lead over the Plains tribes, left more isolated in the west and subject to a tougher regulatory regime.\n\n\u201cI think it is the greatest economic fraud visited upon the Plains tribes since the allotment period of the late 19th Century,\u201d said Richard Grellner, the lead attorney in the Comanche lawsuit. \u201cI don\u2019t like the word fraud but fraud is what it was. I think their economic opportunity was taken away.\u201d\n\nNo one moved faster than the Chickasaw, who now boast 22 casino properties in Oklahoma and net gaming revenues near $1.4 billion last year. The tribe\u2019s annual 2017 progress report listed over $3 billion in assets, a tenfold increase since 2003 and one that includes hotels, a championship golf course and two horse tracks.\n\nThis wealth has funded valuable social and housing initiatives to assist the tribe\u2019s members. But those programs absorb less than half of total revenues, leaving large annual surpluses to build a political and gaming powerhouse.\n\nMillions of dollars go to out-of-state campaign donations and lobbyist fees in Washington and Austin, where the Chickasaw have cultivated close ties with Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s political camp. Inside Oklahoma, the lines blur between itself and the Las Vegas companies leasing gaming machines to poorer tribes. And the Chickasaw subsidiary, Global Gaming Solutions, has become a national player, partnering in gaming projects on both coasts, most recently on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\n\n\u201cEverything we have done is lawful,\u201d said Stephen Greetham, senior counsel for the Chickasaw Nation. \u201cAnd more importantly was the act of a tribal government acting within its own sovereign boundaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what the Chickasaw owned 118 years ago? All of South Central Oklahoma and it was taken away. These tribes lost everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is very much a desire\u2026to tenaciously work to protect this treaty homeland so the next generation of Chickasaws can have a foundation.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the westward expansion of the Chickasaw is plainly a worry for the poorer Plains tribes, who occupied much the same territory prior to Washington assigning the lands to the Chickasaw in 1855.\n\nThe increased competition for the Texas market poses a threat to the smaller gaming operations on which tribes like the Comanche and Apache depend for revenues. Yet Washington shows no sign of trying to mitigate these inequities. Instead, POLITICO found the opposite: an almost \u201chide-the-ball\u201d approach to rivals like the Comanche and no meaningful consultation with top state officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gotten to the point of crazy,\u201d said Steven Mullins, former general counsel to Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin.\n\nThe issue came to a head for the Comanche when Interior approved the new casino on property purchased just four years before by the Chickasaw in Jefferson County.\n\nThe 30.5 acre site is 127 miles southwest of the Chickasaw headquarters in Ada, Oklahoma. But it butts up against ancestral lands and individual allotments of the Comanche. In fact, it\u2019s so far west that it jumps over historic markers more than 10 miles to the east, where the Comanche were fighting the Spanish on the Red River before the Chickasaw came to Oklahoma.\n\nYet for all this history, the Comanche are not even mentioned in the 18-page record-of-decision filed by Interior.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the mystery of it all, the fact that there wasn\u2019t any discussion,\u201d said Jimmy Arterberry, a Comanche leader with a background in historic preservation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Oklahoma Archeological Survey, which assists Oklahoma\u2019s historic preservation efforts, twice warned the Chickasaw in the run-up to the casino project that they were obliged under federal law to consult with other \u201cNative American tribes/groups to identify any concerns they may have pertaining to this undertaking.\u201d\n\nThose letters in 2012 and 2013 were recovered by POLITICO along with one from Mullins in October 2015, when he was still the governor\u2019s counsel.\n\nAddressed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA], Mullins\u2019 letter outlined the state of Oklahoma's objections to the casino and specifically expressed concern that smaller tribes could be hurt economically. But the BIA quickly dismissed these fears, even as it went on to conclude the opposite: that the Chickasaw risked losing \u201cneeded services\u201d without the revenues from the new casino.\n\nTo be sure, most Native American tribes have unmet needs for their people. But the government\u2019s math is striking for what\u2019s left out. Interior does not account for the fact that even without the new casino, the Chickasaw\u2019s annual gaming revenues were already ten times those for the Comanche. Moreover, the Chickasaw\u2019s 2017 financial report showed it had finished the prior year with a surplus of almost $200 million \u2014 more than double the $93 million in anticipated cuts to tribal programs listed by the government.\n\nMost telling is the tone of the April 2016 BIA regional report on the project, released under the Freedom of Information Act. The Archeological Survey gets no mention. Mullins\u2019 letter is written off as \u201cspeculative and lacking in any supporting evidence.\u201d The BIA even mockingly puts his \u201ccould\u201d \u2014 that smaller tribes could be hurt \u2014 in italics.\n\n\u201cI noticed that,\u201d Mullins said, when shown the document. \u201cThey never came back and said, `can we have some proof?\u2019 I would have been happy to talk to them about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not anti-Indian \u2026 We have 38 tribes in Oklahoma and we wanted to make sure each of the tribes had economic sustainability,\u201d Mullins said. \u201cIndian gaming is very limited by geographic location. You can strangle the opportunity of the very small tribes at times by not really balancing those kind of economic interests.\u201d\n\nThe Comanche received worse treatment: The tribe was ignored in the federal review and then left in the dark by Washington for six months after the decision to green-light the neighboring casino.\n\nInterior signed off on the project on the very last day of the Obama administration in January 2017, but no public notice was published in the Federal Register until mid-July. The delay was ostensibly to allow the new Trump Administration time to review the matter. But no one asked the Chickasaw to pause while this was being done.\n\nInstead, the tribe broke ground in May and POLITICO found documents showing the Chickasaw had already filed a facility license notice with the National Indian Gaming Commission in June, more than a month before Interior\u2019s decision finally became public in the Federal Register.\n\nGovernment attorneys have since argued that the Comanche had some warning in that legal notices were published in the spring of 2016, inviting public comment on an abbreviated environmental review of the casino to satisfy the National Environmental Protection Act [NEPA].\n\nA closer look, however, shows that the ads ran in just two newspapers, one of which is headquartered in Ada and scarcely read by the Comanche. The second, the Clay County Leader, circulates in parts of Jefferson County but is a modest border weekly \u2014 based in Texas, not Oklahoma.\n\nNEPA requires a \u201cdiligent\u201d effort to involve the public. The record shows no public comment from anyone in the 30-day review period.\n\nMoreover, once approval was secure, the Chickasaw soon began making changes in the size and layout of the casino, raising questions as to how accurate their presentation was in the first place.\n\nThe number of gaming machines on the site quickly jumped by 20 percent from what had been described in the environmental assessment. Two large waste water lagoons \u2014 shown on the northern side of the casino and away from the Red River \u2014 ended up well to the south and closer to the river.\n\nApart from the potential environmental impact, the revised design mirrors one used before on a much larger Chickasaw casino and hotel project, the Comanche say. Their fear is that the change was done to make it easier to expand on the Red River site and the casino will next grow into a resort hotel for gamblers driving up from Fort Worth.\n\nAll this is grist for the Comanche\u2019s legal challenge, an uphill fight but one that raises two basic questions of fairness.\n\nThe first has to do with administrative flaws in Interior\u2019s approval process: the failure to consult and give timely notice, for example, and the accuracy of the review under NEPA. The second goes to the more complicated question of how Interior has applied a rifle shot exemption for Oklahoma\u2019s tribes in the 1988 gaming act.\n\nAs a rule, Congress sought under that act to restrain any expansion of gaming beyond what were recognized \u201cIndian lands\u201d at the time of its enactment. But Oklahoma\u2019s history demanded some leeway since its tribes had been so trampled in the rush to construct a new 20th-century state from what had been free-standing Oklahoma and Indian territories.\n\nThe compromise was to effectively exempt Oklahoma\u2019s tribes from the October 1988 cutoff if the lands, \u201cafter acquired\u201d into trust, fell within the boundaries of their former reservation. The goal was to create a level playing field. But the Comanche argue that as implemented by Interior, tribes like the Chickasaw end up having an advantage over out-of-state reservation tribes.\n\nThe sheer size of the Oklahoma exception \u2014 covering millions of acres \u2014 poses an administrative challenge. On top of which, the 1988 gaming act requires that before a casino is allowed, a tribe must also show it has jurisdiction and governmental powers over the site.\n\nAs the Chickasaw expand its gaming empire west, these claims of jurisdiction have gotten thinner and become more of a flashpoint.\n\nIn 2006, the BIA seemed to offer some guidance when it circulated a draft rule which defined \u201cformer reservation\u201d lands under the Oklahoma exception as those that are \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of an Oklahoma tribe and that are within the boundaries of the last reservation for that tribe in Oklahoma.\u201d But after the Apache seized on this point to try to block an earlier Chickasaw casino in the Chisholm corridor, the jurisdiction portion was dropped without explanation and the casino approved.\n\nThe new Red River casino, dubbed RiverStar, is within the boundaries set out in the 1855 treaty. But when those Chickasaw lands were allotted more than a century ago, records show this piece went to a member of another tribe, the Choctaw. And much as the Chickasaw point to a significant tribal presence up US 81 in Duncan, Oklahoma, that\u2019s about 40 miles to the north and in another county.\n\nTo get to \u201cyes\u201d on the RiverStar, the Comanche say, Interior had to bend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act so far that it broke the law.\n\nJustice Department attorneys, defending Interior in court filings, answer that the department used a legitimate two-step process to get around this problem.\n\nThe first step was based on authorities given to the Interior Department under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, long before Indian gaming became an issue. Billed as a \u201cNew Deal\u201d for Native Americans, the reorganization act empowered Interior to acquire lands into trust for tribes to promote their sovereignty. By doing so for the Chickasaw in this case, the government argues, Interior established a claim of jurisdiction for the site, and could therefore approve gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n\n\u201cIGRA requires that a tribe have governmental jurisdiction over a parcel before it may conduct gaming on that parcel,\u201d reads a Justice brief for the appeals court. \u201cHowever, IGRA contains no requirement in that a tribe have governmental jurisdiction over a parcel before that parcel may be taken into trust.\u201d Bottom line, the government says: the Comanche\u2019s suits errs in that it \u201cconflates\u201d the Indian reorganization and gaming regulatory acts, two separate statutes with separate requirements.\n\nYet as a practical matter, the two-step approval of RiverStar was conflated itself. Both decisions were executed in a single document with a single signature on a single day.\n\nSupreme Court justices have been skeptical in the past of how real this separation is. In the same 2012 decision which opened the door for the Comanche lawsuit, the late Anthony Scalia and Justice Elena Kagan challenged the notion that when the government acquires land into trust with the sole intent of then approving Indian gaming on the property, it\u2019s two truly independent actions.\n\n\u201cThat strikes me as artificial,\u201d Kagan said in oral arguments. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t acquire this land with no object in mind.\u201d\n\nGrellner, the Comanche\u2019s attorney, said the reorganization act also recognized that the whole concept of what constituted a 19th Century reservation could never be as pure after the allotment era. He pointed to the fact that Section 5 of the act, authorizing the new trust powers, speaks of acquiring lands \u201cwithin and without\u201d reservations.\n\n\u201cWithin the reservation presumes \u2026 there are areas within that reservation where there is no jurisdiction,\u201d Grellner said. \u201cA 19th Century reservation that was then opened to an allotment wasn\u2019t necessarily Indian Country anymore.\u201d\n\nEven as the Comanche challenge has moved through the courts, it was striking to see the definition of \u201cIndian lands\u201d resurface in Congress this year on a very different subject than the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, but one also involving the Chickasaw exercising its power.\n\nThe immediate issue was whether lawmakers should prevent the National Labor Relations Board from claiming jurisdiction over the thousands of employees now at tribal casinos. The definition of \u201cIndian lands\u201d \u2014 from which the labor relations agency would be excluded from \u2014 was very broad when it came to Oklahoma. The phrasing closely tracked that of the gaming regulatory act exemption, only applying to something bigger: the entire National Labor Relations Act.\n\nThe Chickasaw spent heavily on a lobbying for the measure, billed as the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act. Their biggest asset in Congress, Rep. Tom Cole, a well-respected Oklahoma Republican of Chickasaw heritage, helped move the proposal toward a showdown Senate vote in April.\n\nCole did so from his perch on the House Rules Committee, where he put together a package that added the sovereignty bill \u2014 which had already passed the House \u2014 to a non-controversial Senate-passed bill for an Apache tribe water settlement in Arizona.\n\nCole told POLITICO that he had no \u201cMachiavellian\u201d intent and was simply trying to advance a bill supported by many Native Americans in addition to the Chickasaw. But Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), the chief sponsor of the Apache water measure, said he was completely caught off guard. In an added twist, Cole threw in a third Pueblo Indian bill important to Southwest Democrats whose votes were wanted in the Senate to overcome labor\u2019s opposition to the NLRB rollback.\n\nQuickly passed by the House in January and sent back to the Senate, the three-bill package gave the Republican leadership there a ready vehicle to force a vote on the labor regulation issue, which was a priority also for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Apache and Pueblo bills were simply caught in the grinder, and the Apache paid a price when the package died in April after falling short of the 60 votes needed to cut off debate.\n\nIn an interview, Cole said he had had no role in writing the sovereignty bill and adamantly denied any connection with the Comanche challenge. As counsel to the tribe, Greetham said there was no factual basis for \u201cthe theory that folks have suggested, that the Chickasaw Nation worked to have language put into the tribal sovereignty act to bolster their position\u201d with respect to the prior government approvals and trust agreements underpinning the Nation\u2019s casinos.\n\nBut heading for Denver, Grellner is skeptical. And at a minimum the exemption from the labor relations act would have been huge for the Chickasaw, covering a wide swath of Oklahoma and including not just their casinos but any commercial tribal enterprise within the old reservation boundaries.\n\n\u201cLike Oklahoma history, it\u2019s actually been a brilliant scheme,\u201d Grellner said. \u201cThe ironies would be amusing if the effects weren't so devastating.\u201d", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:07.550287"}, {"id": "c2efca02a1ccaf17f4e1f30fa1490f0a39ea8e40", "name": "Democratic senators file FOIA lawsuit over Kavanaugh records", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/17/senators-lawsuit-kavanaugh-documents-826152", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T00:00:00", "description": "Democrats had attempted to delay his confirmation hearings until they got the documents they wanted.", "keywords": ["file", "democratic", "archives", "kavanaugh", "records", "senators", "lawsuit", "cia", "documents", "foia", "request", "filed"], "summary": "Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 collected on the platform during the same month.\n\nJanz declined to name the DCCC spokesperson he said told him he was \u201con your own.\u201d But Greven said DCCC staffers and congressional members assured the campaign last year that if Janz demonstrated an ability to raise money, the DCCC would be helpful.\n\n\u201cIf our national party can\u2019t get up and get excited about taking down Devin Nunes, the person that stands closest to Trump, I don\u2019t know who they can get excited to take down,\u201d said Greven. \u201cI\u2019m sure [the DCCC] thought this kid\u2019s never going to raise any money, and this is going to go away.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC\u2019s lack of investment in Nunes\u2019 conservative-leaning district was not unexpected. In an agricultural region where \u201cVote to Make California Great Again\u201d signs are strapped to cotton trailers on the roadsides, Nunes never figured to face a stiff challenge. Trump carried Nunes\u2019 district by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016, and even Democratic polling puts Janz behind.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the primary that pointed to a sudden Democratic takeover \u2026 [of] one of the most challenging districts for Democrats in the state,\u201d said Rob Pyers of the California Target Book, which handicaps races in the state.\n\nEven with his built-in edge, Nunes is taking no chances. Capitalizing on his controversial role in the investigation of Russia meddling in the 2016 election, Nunes has raised more than $7 million this election cycle, with $6.1 million in cash on hand at the end of the last quarter.\n\nWith Nunes\u2019 cash and structural advantages in the district, as well as Janz\u2019s ability to raise his own money, Pyers said, \u201cIt would be a complete waste of DCCC resources to do much there.\u201d\n\nIn an email, DCCC spokeswoman Amanda Sherman said \u201cthe DCCC trusts candidates to run campaigns that work best for their individual districts, which is exactly what Andrew Janz is doing.\u201d\n\nShe said he \u201chas built a strong, independent, Central Valley focused campaign, that will make this race competitive.\u201d\n\nA DCCC aide said the committee continues to monitor the situation and that a political staffer assigned to the race has been in the Central Valley twice. The aide said the DCCC \u201chas never offered any aid to Janz that it hasn\u2019t delivered.\u201d\n\nYet local Democrats have long complained that the party\u2019s inability to make inroads in the Central Valley owes, in part, to national Democrats\u2019 lack of attention here. The party has failed in previous elections to flip two nearby Valley districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe DCCC\u2019s behavior is apathetic,\u201d said Humberto Gomez Jr., the California Democratic Party\u2019s regional director in the area. \u201cHere we have a candidate in [California\u2019s 22nd District] who\u2019s the most viable, who\u2019s raised the most, and who has the most attention. \u2026 What does the DCCC do? Screw everything up.\u201d\n\nAmanda Renteria, a former top Clinton campaign aide who was trounced by GOP Rep. David Valadao by more than 15 percentage points in a neighboring Valley district in 2014, said the DCCC is \u201cextremely data oriented.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get how they might think this is out of reach,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t know is there\u2019s never been a CD-22 race like this.\u201d\n\nGreven said the DCCC has given Janz access to a generic database used by Democratic candidates nationally and compiled an opposition research book on Nunes worth $9,000. But she said the DCCC has not provided any substantial assistance, including with voter registration, turnout or other field operations.\n\nThe DCCC has not included Janz in its \u201cRed to Blue\u201d program, designed for top-tier candidates in the nation\u2019s most competitive House races. And Janz was not invited to appear with former President Barack Obama at a DCCC event in Anaheim this month. The DCCC said the event was limited to Democrats running in seven Republican-held House districts in California that Clinton carried in 2016.\n\nFollowing the June primary, Greven said Janz appeared at a DCCC event in Washington with other candidates and was promised a share of the fundraising proceeds, but that \u201cthe check never came.\u201d Ever since, Janz said he has been telling donors not to give to the DCCC, but rather to contribute directly to his campaign.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need their help. \u2026 We are fine without them at this point,\u201d said Janz. \u201cI just question sometimes their motives, and I question their competency.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorically, Democrats have not targeted the Central Valley, they have not targeted districts like mine, and have really given up,\u201d Janz said. \u201cAnd this has allowed people like Devin Nunes to return to Congress year after year after year.\u201d\n\nJanz has drawn some measure of support from Democrats outside the DCCC. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who has helped Janz raise money, said Janz has never complained about the DCCC to him and that Janz has \u201craised the money to tell his story.\u201d\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s a district] where we have no business being as close as we are,\u201d said Swalwell. But with Janz, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a hell of a shot.\u201d\n\nJanz has done little to ingratiate himself to the DCCC. A gun owner with a moderate profile, he has said publicly that he would not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for speaker if Democrats retake the House in November.\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re one of the few races here in California where the DCCC isn\u2019t pulling the strings behind the scenes, and I think that allows me to go out there and be myself,\u201d Janz said. \u201cI\u2019m not using DCCC talking points, I\u2019m not using their consultants. I\u2019m really being my own person.\u201d\n\nDescribing the campaign as an \u201carms race,\u201d Greven said, \u201cThis is the only time we\u2019re ever going to get a hit at this guy. This is our one shot.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC, she said, is \u201cblowing it.\u201d", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:09.279535"}, {"id": "d9ea5cb025f1928eafc4e6000d888ca0e87ab35e", "name": "Sheriff: 2-year-old Livingston boy dies after shooting himself in the face", "url": "https://wgno.com/2018/09/17/sheriff-2-year-old-livingston-boy-dies-after-shooting-himself-in-the-face/", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T00:00:00", "description": "A two-year-old boy is dead after he grabbed an unsecured handgun and shot himself in the face.", "keywords": ["face", "shot", "dead", "using", "livingston", "child", "boy", "shooting", "according", "handgun", "investigation", "2yearold", "dies", "sheriff"], "summary": "\u00d7 Sheriff: 2-year-old Livingston boy dies after shooting himself in the faceLIVINGSTON, LA- A two-year-old boy is dead after he grabbed an unsecured handgun and shot himself in the face.\nDeputies responded to reports of a gunshot in the 18,000 block of Murphy Estate Lane around 10 a.m. on September 17, according to the Livingston Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\u201cDuring our preliminary investigation, we learned that a handgun was on a counter in the home,\u201d Sheriff Jason Ard said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s believed the child, using a stool, was able to grab the gun \u2013 which then fired a single shot.\nWe can not release the identity of the child at this time.\u201dNo charges have been filed, and the investigation is still open and ongoing, according to the LPSO.", "content": "\u00d7 Sheriff: 2-year-old Livingston boy dies after shooting himself in the face\n\nLIVINGSTON, LA- A two-year-old boy is dead after he grabbed an unsecured handgun and shot himself in the face.\n\nDeputies responded to reports of a gunshot in the 18,000 block of Murphy Estate Lane around 10 a.m. on September 17, according to the Livingston Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cDuring our preliminary investigation, we learned that a handgun was on a counter in the home,\u201d Sheriff Jason Ard said. \u201cIt\u2019s believed the child, using a stool, was able to grab the gun \u2013 which then fired a single shot.

Ideally, you also want to be sure you can put those funds to work in a coherent strategy to achieve your financial goals.\n\nLet's start, though, by taking a closer look at the specific issue of choosing funds. You say you want to invest in good funds with low costs. That makes perfect sense. But even with those two criteria (both of which, while sound, nonetheless allow lots of room for interpretation), you'd still have hundreds of funds to choose from.\n\nThere are certainly ways you can narrow down the choices. For example, you can home in on funds with below-average annual expenses and solid long-term performance by revving up to a tool like Morningstar's Mutual Fund Screener. Or better yet, you could simply limit yourself to index funds, which not only have low costs but also track the performance of a market index or benchmark.\n\nBut even if you go the index fund route, you still have dozens of index funds to choose from, as many focus on specific segments of the market \u2014 large-stock index funds, small-cap, growth, value, short-term bonds, long-term bonds, etc. Here too, there's an easy way for you to cut through the clutter. Focus on index funds that give you a broad swath of the market rather than a small slice of it \u2014 namely, a total US stock market index fund, a total US bond market index fund and, if you want international exposure, a total international stock index fund and a total international bond index fund.\n\nRelated: Is there a low-risk way to avoid running out of money in retirement?\n\nYou're still not done, however. You also have to decide how much of your money to allocate to each of these funds, so you end up with a portfolio that gives you a decent shot at the returns you need without subjecting you to more risk than you can handle.\n\nAgain, this is an issue you should be able to navigate on your own, as there are relatively simple ways to figure out how to spread your money around. By spending a few minutes with this risk tolerance-asset allocation tool, for example, you can come away with a recommended mix of stocks and bonds that makes sense given, among other things, how long your money will be invested and how far you're willing to see your portfolio's value drop during market setbacks. Or, if you want to take an even easier approach, you could invest in a target-date fund, a type of fund that provides an entire diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds in a single fund.\n\nAll of which is to say that I think that many people can not only identify good low-cost funds on their own, but also create a diversified portfolio that achieves a reasonable trade-off between risk and return (and then maintain that trade-off through periodic rebalancing). But the question is, Are you one of those people? Building and maintaining a portfolio of funds is hardly a superhuman task. But it does require some thought, a little initial effort and then some follow-up and monitoring.\n\nOne more thing: Up to now, we've focused only on investing. But creating a portfolio of good low-cost funds alone won't put you on the road to financial security. You also need to address broader issues, including how much you need to save, whether you're on track to a secure retirement (and, if not, how to get up to speed) and, once retirement is within sight, how to come up with a viable plan to turn your savings into steady income that will support you the rest of your life.\n\nRelated: 4 tips for investing a big windfall in today's market\n\nOnce again, these are all matters that many individuals can resolve on their own. For example, to see if you're making adequate progress toward retirement, you can check out Fidelity's Get Your Retirement Savings Factors tool. And if you want to gauge how much you can withdraw from your nest egg without running out of money too soon, you can go to T. Rowe Price's Retirement Income Calculator.\n\nThis is where a realistic self-assessment comes in. You have to determine whether you're comfortable taking on these financial issues on your own and decide if you can address them adequately. If you're confident that you can, fine. Go for it. But it's important that you be honest with yourself.\n\nIf you decide you're not okay with flying solo \u2014 or at least not for now \u2014 then it probably makes sense to look for help. That doesn't mean you have to hire someone on an ongoing basis. You could opt for an adviser who's willing to provide advice on a specific issue \u2014 building a portfolio, investing IRA rollover money, creating a retirement income plan, whatever \u2014 for a flat or hourly fee. But whatever type of assistance you end up getting, you want to make sure you're paying a reasonable amount and, even more important, dealing with someone who's competent and trustworthy. Asking these five questions can help on that score.\n\nAs I'm sure you've gathered by now, I can give you some guidance about how to better think about the question you've asked and how to gauge whether you need a pro's help.

Salvatore\u2019s body was discovered later that night by his wife among crates of bananas and apples spattered with his blood. When the police arrived, Mrs. Cira appeared not to understand them, or at least she pretended she didn\u2019t speak English. This wasn\u2019t unusual; the police commonly ran into this problem with Italian immigrants who wanted nothing to do with law enforcement on any level. The most preyed-upon victims were often unwilling to give police any leads, even if they\u2019d personally seen a suspect commit a crime against a loved one.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Bellefontaine police lacked investigative skills. No law enforcement institution in the nation had been able to penetrate the criminal organizations that had begun quietly terrorizing cities across America, particularly those with large populations of immigrants from Italy. Nearly 6 million Italian immigrants entered the country in the last two decades of the 1800s and organized crime, common in their native country, often found its way across the Atlantic, too. Increasingly in the papers, the gruesome crimes were credited to \u201cBlack Hand\u201d criminals because of several recovered threat letters penned by \u201cLa Mano Nero\u201d that demanded exorbitant payments, or death.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Bellefontaine cops searched the premises of Demar\u2019s Fruit Importers and collected as much evidence as they could. What they found tipped them off to the idea that the murder was more sinister than a random killing. In the dead man\u2019s pants pocket, there were two letters written in Italian. Knowing they had no chance of getting anywhere by interviewing friends or relatives of Cira, the cops were hopeful that the letters would lead to a break in the case. They also knew that their work was done, because the letters put the murder squarely under the jurisdiction of the United States Post Office Department and its inspectors.\n\nIn the year of the murder, before the FBI, the U.S. Post Office Inspection Service was the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, and the only agency equipped to solve such a large-scale crime. At a time when the United States Post Office has found itself in the cross hairs of Republican cost-cutting\u2014\u201con an unsustainable fiscal path,\u201d in the words of one Donald Trump executive order\u2014the story of Inspector Frank Oldfield recalls a time when the nation\u2019s mail delivery service was not just in the black, but the last line of defense against sophisticated, cross-country crimes.\n\nThe police brought the letter to the attention of Oldfield at the Columbus Post Office. Since arriving in Columbus in 1901, 41-year-old Oldfield had become one of the most successful Post Office inspectors in the service. And he seemed to be the only one up to the task of solving the Black Hand riddle\u2014infiltrating and taking down the first mafia ring in the United States.\n\nWhile the \u201cBlack Hand\u201d was a term used broadly in sensational news articles about Italian immigrant crimes in the media at the time, an organized crime ring was something that almost no one in law enforcement believed existed on American soil. \u201cExperienced policemen say there is no Black Hand: that it is simply a convenient name adopted by any group of Italian criminals who wish to strike terror into their prospective victims,\u201d the New York Times reported in 1910.\n\nMeanwhile, loosely organized coalitions of extortionists, typically from Sicily where such networks were common, took root in American neighborhoods and thrived. One of them was the organization that Oldfield was about to bust open. Salvatore Arrigo, a fruit seller in Columbus, had connected with fruit sellers from Buffalo, New York, Pennsylvania and throughout Ohio, to form his own deceptively silly-sounding criminal ring: the Society of the Banana. By 1909, Arrigo had passed the leadership seat on to Sam Lima, another member of the group, who had much larger financial goals for the group\u2019s criminal activities.\n\nLittle did Sebastian Lima know, the Post Office had started watching him.\n\nIn late February 1909, Lima, Sam\u2019s brother-in-law, left the Society of the Banana headquarters in the back of Sam\u2019s fruit shop in Marion, Ohio, an industrial suburb of Cleveland at the time. Sebastian walked three blocks south and arrived at the town\u2019s post office, a corner storefront in the Masonic Temple building at 173 South Main Street, with a stack of letters addressed to cities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York\u2014invitations to a meeting of top bosses at the Society of the Banana. He asked the clerk for stamps and received tiny two-cent rectangles with perforated edges. The image on the stamp was a portrait in profile of George Washington, his face created from a series of minute strokes and dots. What Sebastian did not notice about the stamps the clerk gave him that day was that each one had a tiny red dot inside the letter o in the word \u201ctwo.\u201d\n\nInspector Frank Oldfield in 1909, during the Black Hand investigation. | Courtesy of William Oldfield\n\nAfter the letters were ready to mail, Sebastian, dressed like a laborer in baggy pants and suspenders, handed the clerk $900 in neatly stacked bills.\n\nEven though this was about twice the clerk\u2019s annual salary, it did not surprise him. In fact, the clerk was already taking out a money order form for Sebastian to fill out. Transferring enormous amounts of money from the Marion post office to Sicily was a nearly everyday occurrence for Sam and Sebastian Lima, who the clerk, and everyone else, believed were brothers. It was assumed by many in the Italian community as well as throughout the city that the two had some kind of criminal business on the side, but the hefty influx of the Lima money into the economy and the Marion County Bank Company kept the gossipers at bay. The two Limas were careful to never make victims out of anyone in Marion, so no one could be sure where the incredible amounts of money came from. Sebastian filled out the money order. The recipient was his mother, Signora Carmella Barbara Lima, in Palermo, Sicily. He paid for the transfer and left.\n\nWhen Lima was out of sight the clerk took the copy of Lima\u2019s money order and put it aside to give to the Post Office inspector, Frank Oldfield from Columbus, who\u2019d come to work in the back office. Then he got out a sheet of stamps, put tiny dots in the o as he had been instructed, and put the sheets away so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally use them on the next customer.\n\nNow, all Oldfield had to do was wait for the invitations to reach the Society members and wait for the meeting at the fruit shop headquarters in Marion, scheduled for March 9, 1909.\n\nLate in the afternoon of March 9, George Pate, Frank Oldfield\u2019s fellow inspector, wearing a slouchy suit with his jacket unbuttoned, loitered in the arched entryway of the Marion train station and waited.\n\nThe Sicilians came on different trains from all different directions. On the Cincinnati inbound, an old man walked especially slowly: Salvatore Arrigo, the first Society of the Banana godfather. With him came another, younger man, who Pate knew must be Vincenzo Arrigo, the old man\u2019s son. From Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Dennison, Ohio, came a long line of Sicilians who Pate checked off his list one by one\u2014all Society of the Banana members, including Antonio Lima, Sam Lima\u2019s father, who was one of the highest up in the gang and had a long criminal history back in Palermo.\n\nBartillon card photo and data about Salvatore Arrigo, the first \"boss\" of the Society of the Banana. | Oldfield Collection\n\nWhen it was completely dark, all four inspectors on duty, including Oldfield, took to the streets to monitor the store from four different vantage points. It was a cold March evening and all of the windows were closed in the store. Oldfield wished he could hear what was going on, but even if he could have, there was no way to understand what was being said without a translator.\n\nThe lights at Lima\u2019s burned on and flickered. The men had a lot of current business to cover. There was new ground to break as well. This was not an ad hoc gang of criminals haphazardly going after one victim, then the next. This was an interstate and intercontinental coalition. This was a covert and tight-knit confederation. And best of all to Sam Lima, the new and improved Society of the Banana was just like a corporation.\n\nSam Lima no longer saw himself as a criminal. He saw himself as a CEO, and he was about to be elected along those lines by the men at the meeting. He saw these regional leaders as his board of directors. He fancied himself like the shipping magnates in the Great Lakes or the oil and steel barons who built skyscrapers and put their names on top. The Society\u2019s well-tuned extortion business was bringing in thousands of dollars every week. Once victims had succumbed to the threatening letters, with some having to be coerced under threat of death, they were described as \u201cfriends\u201d of the Society and continued to make regular \u201ctribute\u201d payment to Sam Lima and his gang.\n\nFourteen Mafiosi sat cramped in Lima\u2019s back room on chairs and fruit crates amid the cigar smoke. Commanding his audience, Sam Lima called the meeting to order. First order of business: a vote to elect a new \u201cboss\u201d of the Society of the Banana. While the title was mostly a token, Arrigo, everyone knew, was too decrepit and unmotivated to remain in the position. A unanimous vote made Cincinnati saloon owner Francesco Spadaro the successor. Spadaro agreed to the title, happy to collect checks and use his saloon as cover for the group\u2019s illegal activities. The real control was to go to the Society\u2019s new director. All in favor of Sam Lima to be the new director of the Society of the Banana?\n\nThirteen hands rose.\n\nLima\u2019s first order of business was to hammer out the Society\u2019s new bylaws, which Oldfield found later in a raid of the building along with minutes of the meeting that night and the lists and ledgers with victims\u2019 names. Over the evening, a brutal and sinister list of articles was proposed and agreed upon.\n\nBylaws and Regulations of the Society of the Banana\n\nArt. 1. The person who tries to reveal the secrets of this society will be punished with death;\n\nArt. 2. A member who offends one of his companions, staining his honor, will be punished according to article 1;\n\nArt. 3. The member who tries to do harm to another branch of the society, or to the family of other companions, if this harm shall have been grave, will be undressed and marked on his body with the mark of infamy and called with word of contempt, \u201cSwindler,\u201d and if the offense is more grave, he will be stabbed;\n\nArt. 4. The person who is a coward and does not sustain the punishment assigned to him by the Society, he will be punished in accordance with Art. 3;\n\nThere were 16 articles in all.\n\nWith that squared away, Lima got down to the main business at hand. Each man came to the meeting with a list of \u201cfriends\u201d for the Society to persecute. Having done their background research on the marks, they estimated net worth and monthly income and put a price on the victim\u2019s \u201cfriendship.\u201d Most of the proposed victims were fruit dealers or other merchants whom the Blackhanders did business with. Some were doctors or other professionals. All were Italian or Sicilian. In a leather-bound ledger, Sam Lima listed all the names. In the next column, he wrote the person\u2019s address. In the third column was the amount of money the Society would require in order to let the victim and his family live.\n\nA translation of a fourth threatening letter to John Amicon in spring 1909. Inspector Oldfield hired several Sicilian translators to interpret correspondence during the Black Hand investigation. | Oldfield Collection\n\nThe fourth column he left blank to fill in once payment or partial payment was made. If no payment was made, there would eventually be an x in that spot. They then set about creating an intricate plan to deliver their demands, not directly, but in a convoluted scheme of \u201cunder cover\u201d letters sent to victims by other victims so that there would be no trail back to the Society of the Banana. There were 43 human targets on the list. The sums they would owe ranged from $200 to $20,000, for an initial payment.\n\nIf all went as planned, in the next month, the Society of the Banana would rake in $118,000.\n\nThe last thing on the agenda to discuss was something eating at Sam Lima: the defiant, dismissive John Amicon. How dare he disrespect the Society and publicly belittle Lima\u2019s operation. John Amicon was one half of Amicon Brothers, the multimillion-dollar fruit distributor with a Columbus operation spanning a city block employing hundreds. Amicon was one of Lima\u2019s biggest targets. After several death threats, not only would Amicon not pay, he publicly disrespected the criminals around the Italian neighborhood in Columbus. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of any man in the United States,\u201d Amicon later told reporters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give them a cent if it cost me my life.\u201d Oldfield learned later that Sam Lima had asked baby-faced Charlie Vicario from Bellefontaine, a city halfway between Marion and Columbus, his favorite go-to hit man, to be on standby for an Amicon hit should it be needed. When Lima said the word, Vicario was to take a stiletto and put it into Amicon\u2019s heart.\n\nLima would give Amicon one more chance to pay.\n\nOutside Lima\u2019s store at daybreak, the inspectors waited.\n\nThe Sicilians emerged from the shop one or two at a time. Over the next few days, without any clue they were being watched at every turn, the Society of the Banana began its new reign of terror: an all-out assault on 43 victims all at once.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWithin a week of the meeting, the post office clerks and postmasters in Marion, Cincinnati, Columbus and a half-dozen other cities were tracking letters sent to a half-dozen states. Every post office where the letters left the hands of Society members was watched. Oldfield engaged local policemen, federal marshals, Secret Service and detectives from the largest private detective firm in the world to help investigate the letters\u2019 final recipients. Frank and his fellow inspectors were completely overwhelmed. It was a tornado of activity on the part of the Society of the Banana that Oldfield didn\u2019t have the manpower to match.\n\nStill, they tried. Oldfield, Pate and Inspectors Edward Hutches, Raleigh Hosford and A.P. Owen went city to city, knocking on doors. Terrified Italians and Sicilians answered, wide-eyed and stuttering. \u201cWe know you just got a letter. What did it say?\u201d the detectives asked. The inspectors were in plain clothes but had the unmistakable look of lawmen. Time and again, the immigrants denied that they had received a letter. Many said they didn\u2019t speak English and gestured that they had no idea what was being asked of them.\n\nIn one case, Hosford got information that a certain victim paid off The Black Hand with a check. \u201cCan we have the endorsed check?\u201d Oldfield asked him after tracking him down at home. The canceled check bearing the endorsement of one of the blackmailers would be critical evidence. The victim shook as though breaking a fever, and flatly refused to give it up.\n\nOriginal stamp marked by Post Office inspectors during the Black Hand investigation.

With his army engaged all across Ohio and into Pennsylvania, travel expenses piled up.\n\nFrank was so sure that he\u2019d have dozens of victims stepping up and willing to testify in court that all of the expense would be worth it. In reality, he had zero.\n\nOldfield\u2019s entire career was on the line. John Amicon was the only victim who had agreed to testify in court against The Black Hand. How could Frank prove there was a highly organized band of criminals with only one single victim coming forward?\n\nLima, like a mouse catching the scent of a cat, sent off a frenzy of letters to his board of directors warning members to lie low and watch their backs.\n\nIt was a warning that went out a little too late. There were 43 \u201ccover letters\u201d containing 43 extortion letters traveling on mail cars and mail pouches in every direction across the Great Lakes, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Chicago. Letters even went as far as Oregon, where Lima had a brother, Michelangelo, with a Portland operation identifying victims on the West Coast.\n\nAfter few weeks with no sign of the lawman, Sam Lima, with renewed confidence, continued his operation. On March 29, postal clerks at Marion reported that Lima dropped off a stack of letters. As he was instructed, the mail clerk gave the unknowing Lima marked stamps and called Oldfield, who inspected the addressees on all the envelopes. Oldfield\u2019s biggest hope was that the final recipient of the extortion letter inside one of those letters was John Amicon. Because without seeing a letter through its journey from Lima\u2019s hands all the way to the sole victim who would testify, Oldfield had nothing on which to base an arrest warrant.\n\nOne was addressed to the teenage member of the gang, Tony Vicario, so Hutches went to Dennison to trail the young mafioso. While Hutches was following Vicario, the same scenario was unfolding all across the region, with other inspectors, postmasters, mailmen and lawmen watching the extortionists as they sent and received letters.\n\nOn March 30, Vicario arrived at the Dennison post office and checked his post office box. There were two letters. From behind two-way glass, D.C. Mann, the Dennison postmaster, and Hutches watched the young Sicilian open the envelopes and read the letters.\n\nTrial exhibit of weapons seized from Black Hand members, including rifles, revolvers, knives, bullets and brass knuckles. | Oldfield Collection\n\nThen Mann came out from behind the counter. \u201cWait, Vicario, there is some more mail for you.\u201d Mann handed Vicario the Lima letter. Vicario opened it, took out another sealed letter and a slip of paper. From the angle where he was behind the glass, Hutches saw \u201cColumbus, Ohio\u201d on the address of the second letter but could not make out the name of the addressee. Still, he was hopeful\u2014Columbus was where John Amicon lived.\n\nThe Post Office inspectors were interfering with Sam Lima\u2019s bottom line, and he was determined to put a stop to the investigation. In the first week of April, Sebastian and Sam loitered around the Amicon Brothers warehouse and watched John Amicon and his brother Charles come and go from the saloon across the street. Amicon\u2019s air was nonchalant. Rather than snarl at the Limas as he had before, John Amicon pretended not to notice them at all. That made Sam Lima all the more furious. There was still no money coming from either Amicon brother, so Lima made a decision. The time was right for a little reminder. The next day, a dynamite explosion blew the back porch off Charles Amicon\u2019s home.\n\nOne day after the explosion, Columbus members of the Society of the Banana, the white-haired Severio Ventola and the young Salvatore Demma, went to the Amicon Brothers\u2019 giant warehouse on Naghten Street to further intimidate the brothers.\n\n\u201cIf you boys will let those fellows alone now and not bother with this investigation, you won\u2019t receive any more letters or have any more trouble,\u201d Ventola told Charles Amicon, who later related the conversation to Oldfield in a deposition.\n\nCharles knew that proposing that his brother back off was fruitless. But he was so rattled by the explosion at his house that he made a futile attempt to get his brother to let it all go. John refused to even discuss it.\n\nA week went by with John and Charles Amicon at odds on how to handle their predicament. It had been a month since the Society of the Banana meeting. Money was rolling in. Sam Lima, once again, felt unstoppable.\n\nThen, on April 8, a letter from Dennison, Ohio, came by mail carrier to Columbus, addressed to Signore Giovanni Amicone, John Amicon\u2019s Italian name. Amicon immediately called Oldfield. When the inspector came, Amicon handed him the letter. Oldfield took out his magnifying glass and looked closely at the stamp. Inside the letter o in \u201ctwo\u201d was a tiny red dot.\n\nMug shots commissioned by Frank Oldfield after the Black Hand captures.

Inside was a threat to his life written in Italian and a demand for payment of $10,000. He translated the message to Oldfield. It was in the same handwriting as the letter that had left Sam Lima\u2019s shop for Dennison 10 days before. After nearly three grueling months, Oldfield now had enough evidence to report to U.S. Attorney William Day and have a federal judge sign a warrant to arrest Sam Lima.\n\nOr so he believed. Oldfield\u2019s hopes were dashed when Day told him there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to get a conviction.\n\nOldfield refused to give up. Over the next six months, he gathered an army. He enlisted lawman across government agencies. He hired private detectives. He called up postal clerks and mail carriers. He collected intelligence in the Italian communities. And most importantly, with patience and finesse, he was able to convince dozens more victims to testify against the Society of the Banana. On a cold winter day in January 1910, Oldfield carried seven steamer trucks of evidence into a Toledo courtroom and took the seat as the star witness in the first federal trial of a Sicilian organized crime ring in America.\n\nFrom INSPECTOR OLDFIELD AND THE BLACK HAND SOCIETY: America\u2019s Original Gangsters and the U.S. Postal Detective who Brought Them to Justice by William Oldfield and Victoria Bruce.

It\u2019s a part of the state full of peanut and feed corn farms, and voting blocs that over the past two decades have been more favorable to Republican candidates. By the time she reached her first stop of the day, a diner in the tiny town of Fitzgerald, nearly 200 miles from Atlanta, it had been nearly two hours since she had seen the last yard sign with her name on it.\n\nAbrams is polling in a virtual tie with Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee for governor, but strategists on both sides say if she is going to make history as the first black female governor in the nation, she first has to make inroads in the rural parts of the state, which tend to be whiter and more conservative. In short, she has to appeal to voters for whom a black woman with a Yale law degree from the deep-blue island of big-city Atlanta represents a major departure from their ideal candidate for statewide office.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhich is how Abrams, 44, came to be sitting at a glossy conference room table at the Valdosta Chamber of Commerce introducing herself as a businesswoman-turned-legislator and making the argument that expanding Medicaid and broadband access, providing quality child care for working parents and education for young children, are not just progressive talking points but pragmatic, pro-growth policies.\n\n\u201cThe challenge in Georgia is that for every good thing we have, we have so many competing issues, competing needs that, I think, unfortunately, have gone unaddressed for the last 15 years,\u201d Abrams told the 10 chamber members seated around her. \u201cAnd my mission is to continue to move forward on the good and then make sure we start to pick up where we falter. For example, being one of the best places in the country to do business is a great thing, but we\u2019re No. 22 of 25 when it comes to small businesses, to mainstream businesses. And that isn\u2019t just an Atlanta issue, it\u2019s a state issue.\u201d\n\nThe first question was delivered with a polite smile \u2026 and a point.\n\n\u201cAll that sounds great,\u201d said Jan Brice, chairman of the chamber and executive director of a local senior living facility, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and traveled to Washington, D.C., for his inauguration. \u201cBut, I mean, are you talking about raising taxes?\u201d\n\nTrue to her technocrat tendencies, Abrams\u2019 answer sounded like it was pulled from the executive summary of a think-tank white paper: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to raise taxes to do this,\u201d Abrams said, hands in front of her as she doled out statistics about Georgia\u2019s robust budget. \u201cOur issue is not resources. Our issue is priorities, and having sat on the Appropriations Committee and the Ways and Means Committee in the Georgia Assembly, I can tell you that we have the resources necessary to meet the needs of the state of Georgia. We haven\u2019t allocated properly.\u201d\n\nKemp, her opponent, and his allies had been painting her in television ads as the second coming of Bernie Sanders, but Abrams touted her experience in the General Assembly finding new revenue streams that could be used to pay for her proposals, making sure to highlight where she agreed with Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican.\n\nThere was a pause before Brice said: \u201cGood answer,\u201d prompting chuckles from the audience.\n\nDuring her three-day, six-stop swing in southern Georgia, Abrams never breathed the names of the national figures who have made her campaign a liberal cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. No Elizabeth Warren, no Kamala Harris, no Cory Booker. While the Democratic Party at large might view her as marching in lockstep with the progressive uprising embodied by the insurgent campaigns of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Ayanna Presley in Massachusetts, Abrams, like her counterpart Andrew Gillum in Florida, is straining to avoid the socialist mantle. She argues that the best card she can play to skeptical Republicans is to highlight her own roots in rural Mississippi and to frame her brand of progressivism as less like an American version of socialism that Republicans abhor and more like the sensible policies of any responsible governor.\n\n\u201cI think part of the narrative that\u2019s started to develop is that there\u2019s something not pragmatic about expanding Medicaid in Georgia,\u201d Abrams told me later as we sat in her campaign SUV parked outside the Seminole County Elementary School in Donalsonville, a modest crossroads surrounded by peanut farms. \u201cAnd my point is to demonstrate that regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, governors across the country have recognized the necessity of Medicaid expansion. And probably the most famous conservative governor would be Mike Pence when he served as governor of Indiana. The most liberal would be Jerry Brown, who\u2019s governor of California, and what I do is to try to juxtapose the two of them to demonstrate that Georgia\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid is not grounded in pragmatism. It\u2019s grounded in the false ideology that\u2019s denying access to health care, especially in South Georgia.\u201d\n\nSo far what few polls there are show that she has work to do making this case, at least in this skeptical corner of the state (\u201cIt\u2019s part of the state that Republicans know they\u2019re going to win, so why poll it?\u201d quipped Republican pollster Brent Buchanan.) In the past two gubernatorial elections, Deal won the entire central and eastern part of Georgia. He won all but one of the counties Abrams visited on her recent tour\u2014three of those five counties by double-digit margins. In 2016, the entire region preferred Trump over Hillary Clinton even though Trump carried the state only narrowly. To win the governorship, Abrams will have to dominate the reliably Democratic parts of the state farther north and also hit a respectable margin in those rural Republican-leaning counties. But, like Democratic candidates before her, she has a significant gap of enthusiasm to overcome. A July SurveyUSA poll found Abrams trailing Kemp 55 percent to 34 percent among rural voters.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to win over all of them, but she needs to cut into the support that Kemp gets almost reflexively. \u201cI would assume she needs to win somewhere between 38 and 42 percent in that part of the state,\u201d Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman said of Abrams.\n\nIf she wins with this strategy, rather than relying on urban voters to carry her, it will offer evidence that a black woman from a liberal metropolis can win a Republican-leaning state with something approximating a bipartisan coalition. For that to happen, though, it will take converting voters like Jan Brice, and that will be a major challenge.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really made up my mind, because I like Brian Kemp,\u201d Brice said after the chamber roundtable, \u201cbut I was very impressed with what she said.\u201d\n\nAbrams, though, even gets pushback from more conservative Democrats in this part of the state. At the stop at the diner in Fitzgerald, Pence Kaminsky, a former local official, said Abrams\u2019 position on tearing down the massive Confederate monument known as Stone Mountain was out of touch with the region. (Indeed, driving down to one of the final stops on the tour, staffers noted a prominently displayed flag for a chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d said Kaminsky, a self-described \u201cyellow dog Democrat\u201d who was going to vote for Abrams. \u201cThat\u2019s something that lets people know that she\u2019s an extremist.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAbrams is not the first Democrat who had to win over the state\u2019s more conservative voters. It\u2019s just gotten a lot harder to do over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe last two Democrats to serve as governor\u2014Zell Miller and Roy Barnes\u2014came from outside Atlanta and were exposed to politics at an early age. But since 2003, when Sonny Perdue became the first Republican to take control of the governor\u2019s mansion since Reconstruction, the state has moved relentlessly into the Republican column even as Atlanta\u2019s population has surged. By 2010, every statewide office was under Republican control. Indeed, so impregnable has the Republican hold become on the state that the most recent Democratic candidate, Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, couldn\u2019t manage to come within 8 percentage points of Deal in the 2014 election. Political pedigree means little now if it\u2019s attached to the wrong party.\n\nDespite his own track record, Carter says he still subscribes to the belief that Democrats can regain their former sway with rural voters.\n\n\u201cMy belief about rural Georgia is that folks feel alienated from the mainstream elements of the economy and if you could convince those people that feel alienated to bring them back in, then you\u2019re going to get some real votes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can convince those people who are alienated that you\u2019re the right person to bring them back in, then you\u2019re going to get some real votes.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether Abrams\u2019 background\u2014so different from those of Carter, Barnes and Miller\u2014is an asset or a liability.\n\nAbrams grew up poor in rural Mississippi. She attended Spelman College in Atlanta on a mix of merit- and need-based aid and graduated magna cum laude, ultimately earning a law degree from Yale (she also has a master\u2019s in public policy from the University of Texas at Austin). While at Spelman, she emerged as an outspoken activist amid protests and riots in Atlanta after the Rodney King verdict in 1992, which put the political bug in her ear that would blossom first into a job as a deputy attorney for Atlanta and later into a seat in the General Assembly. Prior to joining the legislature, Abrams co-founded a financial services firm and a separate beverage company catering to young children. Under the pen name Selena Montgomery, Abrams wrote eight romantic suspense novels. She also founded the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan organization aimed at registering thousands of minority voters throughout the state.\n\nFew viable Democratic candidates for Georgia governor have been as unapologetically liberal as Abrams (during the tour, without caution, she said climate change is real and she doesn\u2019t think assault weapons should be ubiquitous), but when she talks about her time in the state's General Assembly, where she served as minority leader in the House of Representatives, she often highlights examples of her work with Republicans. One of the bigger examples is her work with Deal to reform the HOPE scholarship program, which used state lottery money to pay tuition for needy students but ran into funding problems. In 2011, Abrams was also largely responsible for blocking what Georgia Republicans initially portrayed as a major income-tax cut. Abrams, a lawyer who specializes in taxes, analyzed the proposal and found that it would amount to a major tax increase. She brought her analysis back to her colleagues and worked to persuade them to vote against it. The proposal was defeated.\n\nStill, she has continued to praise Deal for his work on issues that she holds dear, including criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cWhat Nathan Deal has been willing to do\u2014and I\u2019ve been able to work in concert with him on this for seven years\u2014is actually address the disconnect between a state that wants to be the best state in the nation but had some of the most draconian criminal justice rules in the country,\u201d Abrams told me during our interview in her SUV. \u201cSo I give him entirely the greatest credit, because he did good work.\u201d\n\nThe broader strategy behind this is similar to what other Democrats vying for statewide positions in deep-red Southern states have used. Skip the talk about divisive issues such as Obamacare, immigration and same-sex marriage and do what Doug Jones said he did in his victorious Alabama Senate campaign: focus on \u201cbread-and-butter dinner table\u201d issues.\n\n\n\n***\n\nStanding in a pair of brown Hunter rain boots at the edge of a river at a farm in Mitchell County, Abrams listened intently as peanut farmer Glenn Cox and his daughter Casey Cox explained the technical aspects of the farm\u2019s irrigation system and moisture sensors.\n\nAbrams mentioned she \u201cgot to learn variable rate irrigation when I went to the Stripling Center about four years ago,\u201d a reference to the University of Georgia\u2019s C.M. Stripling Irrigation Research Park.\n\n\u201cShe knows all about it,\u201d Casey Cox , 27, joked.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s letting me pretend I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Abrams laughed. The conversation then moved to what a governor could do for farmers in Georgia.\n\nAbrams peppered Glenn Cox with the kind of questions a politician asks of a potential constituent with whom she has little in common: \u201cSo what do you need the governor to know about how we make certain there are more places for growing up and down the river?\u201d\n\nMore attention to rural Georgia, Cox said, explaining that the region needs help with better internet connectivity (an Abrams policy point). Cox mentioned precision agriculture, a technology-focused type of farming that Abrams conceded she needed to learn more about.\n\n\u201cTalk to me about precision ag,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nAfter the tour, the elder Cox said Abrams\u2019 questions seemed informed. Abrams, Cox said, could possibly change voters\u2019 minds in the area \u201cif they met her.\u201d But south Georgia, Cox noted, usually favors Republican candidates.\n\n\u201cBut you know how things work,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got to meet her.\u201d\n\nBut their conversation indicated it\u2019s much more complicated than just shaking hands and agreeing on a couple of convincing answers about expanding broadband or more rural education funding. The simple math is that this is a reliably Republican region and voters need a compelling reason to change their minds.\n\nAbrams, speaking at a packed barbershop in nearby Albany later in the day, started her remarks acknowledging her location.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I know Albany is the center of opportunity in southwest Georgia. I know that when Albany does well, southwest Georgia does well, but if we don\u2019t lift up southwest Georgia, Georgia is not going to do as well as it could,\u201d Abrams said. Albany\u2019s unemployment rate has hovered above the rest of the state\u2019s for more than half a decade. \u201cI want to be clear, I\u2019m not running to be the governor of Atlanta, I\u2019m running to be the governor of all of Georgia.\u201d\n\nThis stop was slightly more familiar to Abrams: a racially mixed crowd of men and women. Attendees cheered for Abrams and peppered her with questions on whether her campaign was prepared for Republican hijinks to stop supporters from voting for her.

Abrams wasn\u2019t the only candidate promising to win over voters across the state, but delivering faster broadband to assuage conservative farmers hundreds of miles away was a much less pressing concern than making electoral history. And while bipartisanship sounds great when you\u2019re sitting in the conference room of the Valdosta Chamber of Commerce, no one in the convention hall was interested in celebrating the accomplishments of a Republican governor.\n\n\u201cWe have a chance to elect the nation\u2019s first African-American woman governor,\u201d Rep. Hank Johnson cheered in his speech shortly before Abrams took the stage.\n\nThe crowd roared.

Documents Mueller might want to inspect? Manafort has agreed to provide them. His attendance and participation at prosecutor debriefings? Done. Perform from the witness stand for prosecutors? You betcha.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhy is Manafort\u2019s cooperation so valuable to Mueller? He\u2019s been operating inside Trump World for almost four decades and, as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for the crucial period including the Republican convention, he is the most powerful of all Trump\u2019s aides and associates to be indicted. As an experienced political strategist and lobbyist, he excels at snooping out the weakness and strengths of other operators. He has kept score over the years and now his score book is about to drop onto Robert Mueller\u2019s desk. Manafort\u2019s defection also stands as a personal rebuke to President Donald Trump, who as recently as Aug. 22 was tweeting his admiration for Manafort for refusing to flip. \u201cSuch respect for a brave man!\u201d Trump wrote. Manafort\u2019s move likewise sends a signal to others in the investigation to cut a deal before Mueller cuts them down in court.\n\nThe plea seems to have caught the Trump team off guard. After Manafort agreed to cooperate, the president\u2019s legal team released a statement attributed to Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that stated, \u201cOnce again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign. The reason: the President did nothing wrong and Paul Manafort will tell the truth.\u201d\n\nMoments later, the team released a \u201ccorrected\u201c statement that was identical to the first except that it deleted the words \u201cand Paul Manafort will tell the truth.\u201d\n\nRather than marking the winding down of the Mueller investigation, the Manafort cooperation portends a widening of the probe that will likely increase Trump\u2019s propensity to head-bang. Manafort\u2014convicted last month of tax and bank fraud and now a fresh confessor to charges of conspiracy against the United States and obstruction of justice\u2014will presumably direct Mueller\u2019s team to other acts of lawbreaking in his orbit.\n\nIt's a rich orbit. Manafort became ever-tighter with Trump, whom he has known for decades, during his five-month tenure with the campaign. He attended the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, convened by an agent of the Russian government on the pretext of peddling dirt on Hillary Clinton directly to Donald Trump Jr. He earned millions from pro-Russia interests for years of work swinging Ukraine politics in their direction. His business prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Ukraine and fellow indictee, Konstantin Kilimnik, is believed to be a Russian intelligence operative.\n\nOne measure of the plea deal\u2019s impact is that it reduces the chance Trump might give Manafort a pardon and thereby still the investigation. If Trump did issue a pardon, it would prevent him from going to jail for the crimes he\u2019s admitted and been convicted of, but it would not slow the investigation because Mueller has already asked and gotten satisfying answers to the main questions he had for Manafort. \u201cThere will be no pardon,\u201d criminal defense whiz and Trump defender Alan Dershowitz confidently predicted on MSNBC this afternoon. \u201cIt will backfire at this point. If [Manafort] is given a pardon, then he can\u2019t take the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Blue-state attorney generals would likely use available evidence to bring Manafort up on state charges for his financial crimes and convict him, and a president can\u2019t pardon a state felon out of jail. Manafort\u2019s pardon moment has passed.\n\nDershowitz went on to say that depending on what Manafort knows, \u201cpotentially, it opens up a lot of doors that probably haven\u2019t been opened before.\u201d\n\nWho is behind those closed doors? Donald Jr., for one, and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, both of whom were with Manafort at the Trump Tower meeting. What sauce might Manafort be able to add to the soup? According to the Washington Post, the president already believes the Trump Tower meeting might have inadvertently gotten his son into legal trouble. This New York Times story from August notes additional legal exposure: Donald Jr. might have lied to Congress when he said he had never sought foreign assistance for the Trump campaign when in fact he met with Arab princes and an Israeli social manipulation specialist. Perhaps Manafort knows something useful about the December 2017 meeting Steve Bannon, Mike Flynn and Kushner took with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. And let\u2019s not forget Roger Stone, Manafort\u2019s one-time partner, who has openly speculated Mueller might come after him for his contacts with WikiLeaks over the hacked Clinton campaign emails.\n\nThe most heavily guarded door, of course, leads to Trump himself. What goods, if any, might Manafort have on the president? We still don\u2019t know whether Manafort was enabling collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign or if he was just using the campaign as part of a scheme to get himself out of deep hock with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. If the Russian exerted indirect influence on the Trump campaign, Manafort would have been an obvious pressure point. If the Russian exerted direct influence on Trump, surely he would have gained a glimpse of it. (It\u2019s worth noting that previous cooperators George Papadopoulous, Rick Gates, Sam Patten, Alex Van der Zwaan, Richard Pinedo, and the aforementioned Flynn have yet to surface information that proves an iron-tight collusion case. It doesn\u2019t mean they ultimately won\u2019t, only that they haven\u2019t. See this Nation piece for this against-the-grain view.)\n\nManafort is still looking at a prison sentence of 10 years. And the plea deal hits him hard in the portfolio. He\u2019s forfeiting tens of millions of dollars in real estate and investments, my Politico colleagues write. There goes his Trump Tower apartment, there go his Chinatown apartment, his Brooklyn townhouse, his Hamptons estate and even his life insurance policy.\n\nThis was Trump's worst week since the last week of August, when Manafort lost his first trial and Trump attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty in New York. And it\u2019s far from being his last worst week.\n\n******\n\nOmert\u00e0 is a dish best served fresh. If you want to rat out your associates, send email to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

By Tuesday, it had topped 35 feet with fast moving water that overtook a major intersection, spreading beyond its banks for about a half mile.\n\nOf Cumberland County's 81 water rescues, the majority had occurred at that site, which is just north of Fort Bragg, a major Army installation.\n\nThomas Maldonado, a Deep Creek Outfitters employee shines a light on the flood waters that have nearly filled the store's basement in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2018.

That height was originally anticipated Tuesday morning but was pushed back to 2 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nA statement from a joint Cumberland County and Fayetteville emergency task force warned of a \"strong potential\" for flooding within a mile of the Cape Fear.

need not replace paperless voting machines before the midterms, dealing a blow to election security activists even as she acknowledged the machines are woefully insecure and that continuing to use them may infringe on voters\u2019 constitutional right to a free and fair election.\n\n\u201cWhile Plaintiffs have shown the threat of real harms to their constitutional interests, the eleventh-hour timing of their motions and an instant grant of the paper ballot relief requested could just as readily jeopardize the upcoming elections, voter turnout, and the orderly administration of the election,\u201d Judge Amy Totenberg wrote in her ruling siding with Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp and the other state defendants over the activists.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe legal victory for Kemp, a Republican who is running for governor in November, means that the state will not have to quickly switch out all of its direct-recording electronic, or DRE, machines and replace them with systems that produce paper records.\n\nBut even as Totenberg denied the plaintiffs' request to force Georgia to ditch its DREs, she also wrote that they had \"demonstrated a real risk of suffering irreparable injury without court intervention\" and that they were \"substantially likely to succeed\" with at least one of their constitutional arguments about the harm that paperless machines caused.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have so far shown that the DRE system, as implemented, poses a concrete risk of alteration of ballot counts that would impact their own votes,\" she wrote.\n\nMorning

Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\"Given the absence of an independent paper audit trail of the vote,\" she added, \"the scope of this threat is difficult to quantify, though even a minor alteration of votes in close electoral races can make a material difference in the outcome.\"\n\nThe case will now proceed and deal with the plaintiffs' constitutional arguments, and Totenberg warned Kemp that his concerns about a chaotic last-minute DRE swap-out will \"hold much less sway in the future \u2014 as any timing issues then would appear to be exclusively of Defendants\u2019 own making at that point.\"\n\nTotenberg added that she was \"gravely concerned about the State\u2019s pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system \u2014 which were raised as early as 2016 \u2014 while aging software arrangements, hardware, and other deficiencies were evident still earlier.\"\n\nRobert McGuire, the lead attorney for one of the groups of Georgia voters, said he was optimistic about the final outcome of the case.\n\n\"We are disappointed that DREs will be used in Georgia this November, but we remain confident that the U.S. Constitution guarantees voters the right to cast their ballots in verifiable, trustworthy elections,\" McGuire said in a statement. \"Although we were unfortunately unable to obtain preliminary relief in time for this November, we are glad the case can now move forward on the merits.\"\n\nKemp, meanwhile, promised that Georgia would continue working through its election security commission \"to responsibly upgrade Georgia\u2019s secure \u2014 but aging \u2014 voting system.\"\n\n\"Our state needs a verifiable paper trail,\" he said in a statement, \"but we cannot make such a dramatic change this election cycle.\"\n\nElection integrity advocates, cybersecurity experts and election officials nationwide have been closely tracking the court case in Georgia, which is one of five states that exclusively uses paperless systems. Amid frantic preparations for the midterms, the case became an urgent test of whether constitutional arguments could force election technology upgrades.\n\nCybersecurity experts argue that paper-based systems are vital to protecting elections from undetectable tampering by sophisticated hackers, such as the Russian intelligence operatives who allegedly interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Those hackers sought to penetrate numerous state voter registration systems and successfully breached a voting technology vendor, according to an indictment by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe ruling comes as voters in South Carolina pursue a similar lawsuit against their state\u2019s election administrators. South Carolina, like Georgia, relies exclusively on DREs.\n\nEven though she ruled for Georgia, Totenberg\u2019s offered plenty of ammunition for critics of Kemp, who has developed a reputation as the leading b\u00eate noire of election security activists and federal officials urging states to upgrade their technology.\n\nKemp has been a fierce critic of federal efforts to improve election security, which has been a fraught task nationwide given how protective states are of their election management responsibilities.\n\nIn January 2017, when the Obama administration classified elections as critical infrastructure weeks before leaving office, Kemp accused Obama of planning a federal takeover of the election process. He also falsely accused the Department of Homeland Security of trying to hack his state\u2019s servers \u2014 a charge debunked by the department\u2019s inspector general after Kemp wrote to then-President-Elect Donald Trump seeking an investigation.\n\nKemp has also faced questions about his stewardship of Georgia elections. In July 2017, his office terminated a contract with Kennesaw State University, which had been running the state\u2019s elections, after officials at the university\u2019s Center for Election Systems ignored warnings about security flaws in a key server and then erased the server, depriving the eventual trial of key evidence.\n\nIn her ruling, Totenberg excoriated Kemp and his allies for shrugging off the plaintiffs' cybersecurity concerns while offering scant contrary evidence. She noted that the state defendants \"presented no witnesses with actual computer science engineering and forensic expertise\" to discuss the KSU server, the state's DREs, or other security issues.\n\n\"The Defendants\u2019 response brief is close to non-responsive to the concerns that Plaintiffs raise about the serious vulnerability of the server and the election data system at large to intrusion, virus, or attack,\" she wrote.\n\nIn addition, she said, the plaintiffs' claims about security vulnerabilities in Georgia's election system \"have hardly been rebutted by Defendants except via characterizations of the issues raised as entirely hypothetical and baseless.\"", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:13.693773"}, {"id": "751eb283712904b8358f3a5a279d11b68a76bc87", "name": "These Before And After Photos Of One North Carolina Town Show The Huge Impact Of Hurricane Florence's Flooding", "url": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/before-after-photos-north-carolina-town-florence", "timestamp": "", "description": "BuzzFeed News accompanied a United States Coast Guard team on a rescue mission in Trenton, North Carolina.", "keywords": ["carolina", "uscg", "mapsafter", "photos", "newsbefore", "town", "ellie", "teams", "hurricane", "flooding", "huge", "western", "hall", "river", "florences", "buzzfeed", "north", "impact", "google"], "summary": "BuzzFeed News spent Monday with a Coast Guard team assisting with the hurricane emergency response in Jones County, North Carolina.\nThe Western River Flood Punt units deploy across the US after natural disasters like hurricanes or flash flooding.\nEllie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsTrenton is a small town in Jones County with a population of approximately 285, according to the US census bureau.\nHere are pictures of Trenton from Google Maps, compared with similar images from Monday's mission: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsBefore: Google MapsAfter: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsHelp us cover more breaking news on the ground.\nBefore: Google MapsAfter: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsBefore: Google MapsAfter: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsBefore: Google MapsAfter: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsBefore: Google MapsAfter: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsBefore: Google MapsAfter: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsBefore: Google MapsAfter: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsBefore: Google MapsAfter: Ellie Hall / BuzzFeed NewsBefore: Google Maps", "content": "BuzzFeed News spent Monday with a Coast Guard team assisting with the hurricane emergency response in Jones County, North Carolina.

Oh for the days when president George W. Bush gave his wife Laura a loving but firm pat on the backside in public. The man knew who was boss.\"\n\nIn 2015, Judge writes in Splice Today about what he calls \"damseling,\" which he describes as \"making a woman a passive damsel in distress who needs rescuing.\"\n\n\"Of course, a man must be able to read a woman's signals, and it's a good thing that feminism is teaching young men that no means no and yes means yes. But there's also that ambiguous middle ground, where the woman seems interested and indicates, whether verbally or not, that the man needs to prove himself to her.

The first 1,000 shoppers get a free reusable bag.\n\nIt remains to be seen if that event will generate the same kind of fervor H&M did. After all, Target is well known in Colorado, having operated stores here for decades. It\u2019s got brand recognition but isn\u2019t trendy or new like its Scandinavian counterpart.\n\nRegardless of how many people line up before the new store\u2019s doors are flung open at 1600 California St., downtown business advocates are ecstatic over its arrival and what it says about the economic vitality of a portion of Denver sporting a retail vacancy rate of 3.3 percent.\n\n\u201cWhen Target chooses to locate somewhere they are sending a message that the customer base is there,\u201d Downtown Denver Partnership CEO Tami Door said Monday. \u201cThis shows this brand has identified the center city of Denver \u2014 and it sends this message to other brands \u2014 as a place where they believe they will be successful.\u201d\n\nThe 16th Street Mall store won\u2019t be just any Target. At 30,000 square feet, it\u2019s less than quarter the size of the retailer\u2019s average store. It will feature a curated collection of goods designed to appeal to downtown shoppers, Ashlee Justis, the store\u2019s team lead, said.\n\nOn its main floor, the second floor of the 1600 California St. building, shoppers will find clothes and accessories \u2014 including Broncos and other local team gear \u2014 and an electronics and entertainment department complete with cellphones that can be activated on the spot. There will be a grocery section with fresh produce and frozen goods, as well as grab-and-go items such as sandwiches, meant to cater to customers popping in and out on their lunch breaks.\n\nFloor two will carry cosmetics and personal care products and travel goods \u2014 again catering to a specific downtown market segment: tourists. There will also be an assortment of home wares and decor, a category H&M added to its 16th Street Mall store in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhy this is going to be so exciting, especially for the downtown Denver guest, is this store is created especially for them,\u201d Justis said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a quick, convenient spot to get those products you have relied on Target for traditionally.\u201d\n\nDoubling down on the convenience, the store will have a CVS pharmacy and self-checkout kiosks. It will also serve as the order pickup point for people who buy from Target.com, company officials say. Place an order on the website, and within an hour that item will be ready at the store.\n\nThe store is an example of Target\u2019s real estate evolution. After going from big to jumbo in the form of its Super Target store formats, the company is now going small. When the 16th Street Mall store opens it will be one of 71 small format stores the retailer has opened across the country. Meant to fit in denser urban centers or near college campuses, the smaller footprint allows Target close places it hasn\u2019t been before, such as downtown Denver, company spokeswoman Jacqueline DeBuse said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been interested in the (downtown) Denver community,\u201d DeBuse said. \u201cWe know there are daytime professionals and round-the-clock residents.\u201d\n\nDeBuse\u2019s reference to round-the-clock residents offers a potential clue as to why it has taken Target so long to hit its mark downtown. The Downtown Denver Partnership\u2019s CEO Door said her organization has been working on bringing the brand to the city\u2019s urban core for decades. Every time an opportunity came up, some factor dragged it down, whether the location or property owner wasn\u2019t the right fit, or Target not being in an expansion mode at the time, or the demographics not being strong enough.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re working to attract a retail location, everything has to be right,\u201d she said.\n\nIn downtown Denver today \u2014 defined by the partnership as the area made up of the Auraria, Lower Downtown, Ballpark, Central Platte Valley, Golden Triangle and Center Business District neighborhoods \u2014 more people are working, visiting and living than ever before. Randy Thelen, the partnership\u2019s vice president of economic development, said 23,000 people live downtown, three times as many as 2000. The area\u2019s 136,000 employees is an all-time high.

However, among the U.S. metropolitan areas with the highest net population declines due to migration, the vast majority have had the largest overall decreases in population.\n\nTwo notable exceptions are New York and Los Angeles. While tens of thousands more people moved out of each city than moved in, both cities have still had among the highest net increases in population. This is because of natural population growth -- hundreds of thousands more people in these cities have been born than died. Notably, Los Angeles had a net migration loss of 93,959, but the overall population increased by over three-quarters of a million people because of births.\n\nFrey explained that movement from New York and Los Angeles to many of the cities with the largest net migration increases is due to residents of these cities getting pushed out because of rising populations and prices, the latter of which is a product of the economic recovery. \"Now that things are picking up again, people are moving out of cities. As the housing market is coming back, people are being sucked out of pricey areas to where it is more affordable again.\u201d\n\nFrey gave the example of one common migration pattern: Los Angeles to Las Vegas, the latter of which had the 15th highest net population increase due to migration. Los Angeles has always lost residents to Las Vegas, but when the recession hit and housing prices fell, that movement slowed significantly.\n\nNow that housing prices have recovered in Los Angeles and have become too expensive for many residents, people are once again moving out of the city in droves. As of 2016, Los Angeles had the seventh highest median home value of any metropolitan area, at $578,200. Las Vegas\u2019 median home value is just slightly more than half that, at $233,700.\n\nMore:Cost of living: The purchasing power of a dollar in every state\n\n\u201cThe same sort of thing is true for a place like New York,\u201d Frey added. \u201cThere has always been huge movement going from New York to Florida, but during the Great Recession period that slowed up quite a bit, and now it is picking up again.\u201d\n\nFrey added that the reasons behind the decline in population in cities like Los Angeles and New York -- overcrowding and high prices -- are very different than the reasons for decreases in other cities on this list, notably Rust Belt cities like Flint, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; and Rockford, Illinois; and even larger cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, and Milwaukee. These cities have been losing domestic migrants for decades due to stagnating economic conditions stemming from the decline of American manufacturing.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify America\u2019s Fastest Declining Cities, 24/7 Wall Street reviewed the annual estimates of resident population and the estimates of the components of residential population change from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017, provided by the American Community Survey.

It serves nearly all of Westminster north of West 92nd Avenue and south of 124th Avenue.\n\nAfter being briefed about the sewer\u2019s capacity, age and condition issues last week, the City Council on Monday night unanimously adopted an emergency ordinance that freezes acceptance of new, large-scale development proposals in the area served by the Big Dry Creek network for up to a year.\n\n\u201cThe (sewer) system is now at a trigger point of risk that warrants both near-term mitigation measures, as well as longer-term expansion to support continued development,\u201d a staff memo recommending the emergency ordinance read. \u201cNot addressing these system constraints is believed to compromise the health, safety, and welfare of the community with a level of risk that is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe moratorium, which went into effect at noon on Tuesday, is designed to allow a consultant to inspect the sewer, collecting information that will be put to use in a project to fix, expand and replace portions of it, according to a city memo. City staff are expected to work simultaneously to pinpoint spots for where incremental or innovative fixes could be employed and make plans for easements and land acquisitions that might be required by future repair and replace projects. One idea floated at Monday\u2019s meeting was reactivating decommissioned sewer lines in the area to help with capacity.\n\nThe Big Dry Creek system was first assessed in 2012, then again in 2015, according to the city staff. Those studies found \u201cseveral segments\u201d of the system were nearing the end of their lifespan or were not large enough to handle all of development and growth in the city. The city made plans to overhaul the system starting in 2019 director of public works and utilities Max Kirschbaum said Monday.\n\nBut an assessment done earlier this year \u2014 when factoring in projects in the city\u2019s pipeline and flows those could contribute to the sewer system \u2014 painted a dire picture. Kirschbaum said the system is already running the risk of a sanitary sewer overflow, an event where raw sewage escapes from a sanitary sewer.\n\nWestminster\u2019s sewer flows have increased by 40 percent since 2008, city officials said. The Big Dry System was dates back to the 1970s, before the city went through several waves of population growth.\n\nThe moratorium applies to new development applications that would increase flows into the Big Dry Creek network. Home renovations or projects that will not add to the sewage flows will not be subject to the freeze, officials said.\n\nApplications and pre-applications submitted prior to the moratorium taking effect will be honored. But developers who fail to follow up a pre-application meeting with more complete planning documents within six months will see their projects expire, according to the city.\n\nEven if a developer has city approval to move forward with plans, they may not be given access to the sewer system. Westminster\u2019s municipal code dictates wastewater service commitments do not take hold until a building permit is pulled. That means builders in the affected area who goes in for building permits may be told the sewer network does not have the capacity to serve their projects. Access to the sewer system will be assessed and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure fairness, city officials say.\n\nJenni Grafton, the city\u2019s acting economic development director, estimated there are between 30 and 40 projects in the affected area that could be in line to pull permits. Some of the city\u2019s premier mixed-used neighborhoods and shopping areas will not be impacted by the development freeze. The Downtown Westminster project, rising where the Westminster Mall once stood, and the Westminster Station transit-oriented development going up around the city\u2019s B-Line train stop, are served by a separate sewer network. The same is true for its north Interstate 25 and Huron Street business district. Those areas include the St. Antony North Health Campus and the Orchard Town Center shopping area.\n\nSeveral developers that have projects on tap in Westminster came to Monday\u2019s meeting to urge the council to move along their projects. Council members sought to assuage fears.\n\nCouncilwoman Shannon Bird said, \u201cWe are not closed for business.\u201d\n\nThe city will lift the moratorium before 12 months if possible, but its sewer contractor is expected to need nine months to assess the system. Mayor Herb Atchison preached patience.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the study done first,\u201d he said. \u201cHow big is (the problem) and how long do we think it will take us to fix it? That\u2019s not going to happen in 12 months.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how much it might cost Westminster to address the emergency, but city staff did say where they expect much of the money to come from: sewer rate hikes and municipal debt.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:18.053267"}, {"id": "2d3849827608d7af091119c5984347c4039548cc", "name": "Florence Pushes Away From Carolinas but Rivers Keep Rising", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/us/hurricane-florence-live-updates.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T00:00:00", "description": "Record-breaking rains pushed rivers over their banks and people were still being rescued, even as the remnants of Hurricane Florence move out.

Today, we have an enormous amount of knowledge about the disease, we have increased the number of drugs that can effectively kill the cancer, and patients are surviving longer, with a much higher quality of life. Now, people with advanced breast cancer can treat it like a chronic disease, managing it carefully with medications but able to live long, full lives. One key part of this progress is the discovery of specialized treatments for specific types of breast cancer. If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) breast cancer, this phrase describes how your cancer grows, which determines the type of treatment you\u2019ll be receiving.\n\nMedical Reviewers: William C.

Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\n\n\n\nHow Cancer Grows\n\nThe first thing we\u2019ll do after diagnosis is identify how your cancer cells grow, so we can interrupt that process with the right treatment. Cancer itself, in a nutshell, is the uncontrolled growth of cells. This happens because cancer cells take advantage of the natural cell growth process. Tiny proteins called receptors live on the surface of certain cells in your body; these receptors receive messages from substances in the bloodstream and pass these messages along to the cells they live on. These messages usually tell the cells to do something, like grow or replicate. Typically, your reproductive hormones, estrogen and progesterone, send messages to receptors on your healthy breast cells and tell them to grow. However, in 70% of breast cancer cases, breast cancer cells have these hormone receptors too, and receive the message to grow. The cancer cells follow orders and continue to replicate, so the cancer spreads. This is called hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) breast cancer.\n\nThe main goal of treatment for HR-positive breast cancer is to lower levels of estrogen and progesterone and also prevent these hormones from telling cancer cells to grow. We can do this in a few ways, using hormone therapy, also known as endocrine therapy or hormone manipulation.\n\nUnderstanding Hormone Therapy\n\nChoosing the right hormone therapy for a patient depends on if she has been through menopause yet. Premenopausal women are still producing lots of estrogen and progesterone, while postmenopausal women aren\u2019t producing as much, so we approach these cases differently. For women who haven\u2019t gone through menopause, we will typically turn to a type of drug called a selective estrogen-receptor response modulator (SERM) which prohibits cells from being able to use estrogen. The most commonly used SERM is called tamoxifen (Soltamox, Nolvadex). We usually combine tamoxifen with medications called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agents (LHRHs). These stop the ovaries from producing estrogen. Examples of LHRHs include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron). In some cases, premenopausal women will choose to undergo surgery to remove the ovaries altogether, although they will not be fertile after this procedure.\n\nIn postmenopausal women, we may use tamoxifen as well, but can also turn to a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors (AIs). These drugs drive the estrogen level down to virtually zero\u2014this way, there\u2019s almost no estrogen telling breast cancer cells to grow. Aromatase inhibitors include anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara). AIs usually work well; however, we\u2019ve found that patients can become resistant to them over time. But new drugs have recently come to the market that can help with this problem, called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors.\n\nCDK4/6 Inhibitors\n\nCDK plays a role in the process that help cells divide and grow. CDK4/6 inhibitors block this process in specific places, affecting only cancer cells. Recent clinical studies have shown that combining aromatase inhibitors with CDK4/6 inhibitors is far superior than receiving aromatase inhibitors alone. Taking a CDK4/6 inhibitor can prevent patients from developing resistance to aromatase inhibitors, which is why these new drugs are so important. This means the patient can stay on effective treatments for longer periods of time. This combination is now the first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced HR-positive breast cancer, because studies show taking both drugs together doubles the length of time a patient lives without her cancer progressing. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three CDK4/6 inhibitors thus far\u2014palbociclib (Ibrance), ribociclib (Kisqali) and abemaciclib (Verzenio)\u2014but more are coming down the pipeline.\n\nWhen we prescribe these agents, we need to follow these patients closely. Every month, the patient comes to see us for tests to check her liver function, kidney function, and white blood cell count. Sometimes these medicines affect bone marrow production of cells, so you won\u2019t have a healthy number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. But these effects can be treated and typically don\u2019t lead to infections or severe problems if they\u2019re well-monitored. The patient experience is now much better with these drugs than with other options and they\u2019re helping to turn this type of breast cancer into more of a chronic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS CONTENT DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.

To provide ample transparency, we will hold a public hearing Monday to give these recent allegations a full airing,\u201d Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said.\n\nDemocrats on the Judiciary panel \u201cwere not informed about a hearing\u201d in advance of the GOP decision, an aide said.\n\nRepublicans moved ahead after a frenetic day that began with Ford\u2019s lawyer saying that the California-based professor would be willing to testify about her alleged high school-era sexual assault by Kavanaugh \u2014 an accusation that has added fresh turmoil to his already tumultuous confirmation fight.\n\nA growing number of Republicans said after Ford stepped into the public eye that GOP leaders\u2019 plans to confirm Kavanaugh by the end of the month may need to be altered in order to hear her out. By midday Monday, six Republican senators had said the Judiciary Committee needs to weigh Ford\u2019s account, a large enough group to raise serious doubts about whether the nomination will proceed.\n\nBut Kavanaugh himself has only doubled down on a strenuous denial of Ford\u2019s allegation. The federal appellate judge told Sen. Orrin Hatch in a Monday phone call that he did not attend the party more than three decades ago at which Ford says the assault occurred, the Utah Republican said.\n\n\u201cI believe him. He\u2019s a person of immense integrity,\u201d Hatch told reporters, declining to address how Kavanaugh could speak definitively about not attending a decades-old event that Ford has discussed only in broad terms.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Ford dated the assault to 1982, when she was 15 and Kavanaugh was 17, and told the Post that it \u201cderailed me substantially for four or five years.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh on Monday vehemently denied the accusation and said he is willing to speak to the committee.\n\n\u201cThis is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes \u2014 to her or to anyone,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBecause this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Monday reiterated its support for Kavanaugh, reasserting his Friday statement that he \u201ccategorically and unequivocally\u201d denies the allegation.\n\n\u201cJudge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation,\u201d White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement. \u201cHe stands ready to testify tomorrow if the Senate is ready to hear him.\u201d\n\nAllies of Kavanaugh are pressing forward. The Judicial Crisis Network plans to run $1.5 million in ads to push Kavanaugh across the finish line in a campaign featuring a longtime friend of the judge\u2019s, according to a person familiar with the effort.\n\nIf Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser accepts a formal invitation to testify in a public forum it would carry significant political risk for all sides, summoning echoes of Anita Hill\u2019s explosive 1991 testimony alleging sexual harassment by now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Such a hearing also could be difficult to follow through on without definitively derailing the GOP\u2019s plans to push Kavanaugh to a final vote later this month.\n\nKavanaugh remains short of the votes to be confirmed in the 51-seat GOP majority. And moderate Democrats, none of whom said they will support Kavanaugh thus far, are balking at moving too quickly. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) said the allegations need to be \u201cthoroughly investigated\u201d by the Judiciary Committee, adding that both Ford and Kavanaugh have separately agreed to testify.\n\n\u201cIt takes courage for any woman to speak up about sexual assault, and we need to respect Prof. Ford by listening to her and hearing her story,\u201d Heitkamp said in a statement that she tweeted.\n\nKatz, during the CBS interview, said she has heard that Republicans \u201cintend to play hardball\u201d if Ford testifies.\n\n\u201cThis is not an exercise that is designed to get at the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an exercise that\u2019s designed to terrify somebody that\u2019s already been traumatized.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have spent weeks trying to slow down Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation by pushing for additional documents from the 53-year-old appeals court judge\u2019s tenure in the administration of former President George W. Bush. Republicans have sought to portray Democratic calls for delay following the assault allegation as politically motivated, questioning why Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) did not act earlier on a letter she received from Ford in July, but Feinstein has pushed back by noting that Ford herself had insisted on confidentiality before stepping forward on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary Committee should treat this with the seriousness it deserves,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican member of the committee.\n\nJames Arkin and Hugh T.

Although Ford\u2019s lawyer said that her client would be open to \u201ca fair proceeding,\u201d it remains unclear whether she would agree to a planned hearing on Sept. 24 that Republicans have set up to help save Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"I don't know how they can say: I'm just not going to appear. She has the option of a closed session, with cameras or without. We want her to appear. And then she has said, before we made the decision that she wanted to appear. So that's what we want,\" Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said after he and other Judiciary Committee Republicans met with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for nearly an hour.\n\n\"She's asked to come and testify, she needs to be heard ... I hope she comes.\"\n\nOne Kavanaugh ally said that Ford\u2019s attorney Debra Katz, a well-respected veteran of high-profile sexual misconduct cases, has \u201ctried to impose some serious conditions on\u201d Ford\u2019s testimony, though it's unclear what those conditions are.\n\nBut Grassley later reiterated that Ford still hadn't contacted his panel: \"We have not heard from her.\"\n\n\"Our staff reached out to Dr. Ford\u2019s lawyer with multiple emails yesterday to schedule a similar call and inform her of the upcoming hearing, where she will have the opportunity to share her story with the Committee. Her lawyer has not yet responded,\" said Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Grassley on the committee.\n\nRepublicans have billed the public hearing as an opportunity for both Kavanaugh and Ford to share their sides of the story. GOP leaders made that decision under pressure from undecided members of their conference \u2014 chiefly Flake, who said he would vote against Kavanaugh in the committee if senators didn\u2019t get more of a chance to hear from Ford.\n\n\"We have a woman who has come forward, she deserves to be heard, it's important that her voice and her story is shared,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), an undecided swing vote on the nomination, on Tuesday.\n\nIf Ford ultimately opts out of the opportunity to testify, however, Republicans suggested that they plan to move forward with a Kavanaugh-only hearing. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a former Judiciary chairman, said that \u201cI think\u201d the hearing would proceed even if Ford chooses not to accept the invitation to testify.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nDemocrats had received no new commitments from Ford as of Tuesday morning.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) pushed back hard on the fast turnaround of the hearing and called for testimony from Mark Judge, the third person whom Ford alleges was in the room at the time of the assault. The GOP\u2019s plan to omit Judge and hear only from Kavanaugh and Ford is \u201csimply inadequate,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Judiciary Democrat, said he would attend a hearing if it\u2019s just Kavanaugh but is also pushing for far more, including an appearance from Judge.\n\n\u201cI do not think we will be meeting the test of a full and fair hearing without Mark Judge present, without Dr. Ford present and without the FBI doing an expanded background check,\u201d Coons said. \u201cThere are questions to ask of [Kavanaugh] now. I do hope Dr. Ford comes forward and is treated respectfully.\u201d\n\nFlake, however, was unsure whether Judge would be called for the committee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure whose witness he would be,\" he said.\n\nIf Ford and her lawyer ultimately opt out of the GOP\u2019s public hearing invitation \u2014 Democrats have skipped a staff-level call with Kavanaugh on the matter, casting doubt on their participation \u2014 Republicans will face another tough decision on whether to press ahead with the nomination.\n\nAfter Democrats declined to participate, Republican staff interviewed Kavanaugh on Monday evening. Foy said the nominee was \"forthright and candid.\"\n\nOne top Republican on Judiciary, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said Monday night that he expects the committee to push for a vote on Kavanaugh next week regardless of whether Ford agrees to the GOP\u2019s public hearing.\n\n\u201cShe can come if she likes, but if she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to,\u201d Graham said on Fox News. \u201cKavanaugh can come, and I think he will. We will vote on Wednesday.\u201d\n\nGrassley himself, however, declined to commit to any timing for a committee vote on Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in brief remarks to reporters Monday night as he left the Capitol following a chaotic day of speculation about the future of Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination.\n\nWhile the GOP waits to hear about whether Ford will testify, they also are discussing the use of a third-party to question Ford in an effort to make the hearing appear more fair and less political, according to one GOP senator. But Grassley appeared uncertain whether that approach could succeed, quipping Monday night that \u201cI don\u2019t know how you shut a senator up if they want to ask questions.\u201d\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Tuesday tweeted that she'll recommend to Grassley that counsel for Ford be allowed to question Kavanaugh, and Kavanaugh's counsel be allowed to ask questions of Ford.\n\nSen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) also floated the idea of an independent counsel.\n\n\u201cIt would be better to have either counsel for the majority or minority staff that might do this. It could be independent counsel. Or designate one or two senators. We don\u2019t need 13 or however many senators continuing to pound both witnesses,\u201d said Jones.\n\nThe high degree of uncertainty surrounding Monday\u2019s planned hearing has left official Washington on a state of high alert about Kavanaugh.\n\nIn conversations with associates, one Judiciary Committee staffer put the odds of Ford testifying before the full committee at 50 percent and said there was just a 25 percent chance she\u2019d appear at a public hearing.\n\nWhether or not Ford agrees to appear, Republicans\u2019 initial goal of getting the 53-year-old appeals court judge confirmed in time for the Oct. 1 start of the Supreme Court\u2019s term is already in serious jeopardy.\n\nAsked if Republicans would agree to a hearing later than Monday if Ford\u2019s camp asks for that delay, Grassley said only that he is \u201ctaking things step by step.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s top Democrat, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, questioned why Grassley is limiting witnesses to the committee and argued the GOP is still rushing the nomination.\n\n\u201cChairman Grassley today said there would be only two witnesses invited to testify at the Kavanaugh hearing next week on sexual assault allegations. Compare that to the 22 witnesses at the 1991 Anita Hill hearing and it\u2019s impossible to take this process seriously,\" Feinstein said. \"This is another attempt by Republicans to rush this nomination and not fully vet Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:20.524287"}, {"id": "b269c9407d8e0715108ba76ced73b06c4a3f6cdf", "name": "Trump\u2019s Growing Legal Team Has a Problem: It\u2019s Operating Partly in the Dark", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/us/politics/trump-legal-team-lawyers.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "The president\u2019s lawyers are struggling to understand where the investigations surrounding him are going, and the extent of his legal exposure.", "keywords": ["presidents", "dowd", "legal", "problem", "partly", "trump", "growing", "mr", "dark", "trumps", "witnesses", "lawyers", "team", "operating", "mueller"], "summary": "Mr. Trump\u2019s expanded and reconstituted legal team is now dealing far more aggressively with Mr. Mueller.\nAnd once Mr. Dowd was gone, the new legal team had to spend at least 20 hours interviewing the president about the episodes under investigation, another necessary step Mr. Dowd and his associates had apparently not completed.\n\u201cHe finds himself in a legal mess today because of their incompetence.\u201dNew questions about the president\u2019s first legal team arose after the journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s new book \u201cFear,\u201d was published this month.\nThe book said that Mr. Dowd believed that Mr. Trump was a liar who was not capable of answering questions from Mr. Mueller.\nAnd in a meeting with prosecutors, Mr. Dowd said nearly as much, Mr. Woodward reported, telling Mr. Mueller that the president would most likely provide a false statement in an interview.", "content": "Mr. Trump\u2019s expanded and reconstituted legal team is now dealing far more aggressively with Mr. Mueller.

The summit\u2019s speakers include a host of prominent Republicans and others on the political right.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile the schedule indicates that Pompeo will be part of a discussion on international religious liberty \u2014 an issue that Congress has mandated the State Department champion \u2014 Pompeo is still walking a fine line just by showing up, former and current U.S. officials say. The situation is also potentially fraught given the event is likely to help galvanize Republicans ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a given when you become secretary of state that you are representing the United States, and it\u2019s particularly important to represent a unified country,\u201d said Philippe Reines, who served as a top aide to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state.\n\nA former official in the George W. Bush administration agreed that \u201cit\u2019s unusual for a secretary of state to be at an event with \u2018voter\u2019 in the title.\u201d The former official argued, however, that what \u201csaves\u201d Pompeo \u201cis that the discussion is on international religious freedom.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Trump administration has touted its support of religious freedom with gusto, much to the joy of conservative Christians worried about their brethren in the Middle East.\n\nStill, for a host of legal and other reasons, secretaries of state, like secretaries of defense, generally avoid gatherings that smack of partisanship, or that otherwise may deal with U.S. elections.\n\nAnd while officials and experts did not rule out the possibility that past secretaries of state had attended events similar to the Values Voter Summit \u2014 either on the right or left of the political spectrum \u2014 none reached by POLITICO could recall any similar cases of a secretary having done so.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nSome pointed out that secretaries of state often speak about foreign policy at conservative or left-leaning institutions \u2014 a think tank, for example. Secretaries of state of both parties have also spoken before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the bipartisan pro-Israel lobbying group.\n\nThen-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at least once attended \u201cThe Wednesday Meeting,\u201d a gathering of broad center-right figures, where she spoke about the Bush team\u2019s foreign policy, said Grover Norquist, the anti-tax increase evangelist who organizes the meetings.\n\nStill, the Values Voter Summit is more explicit than most such events about its goals. Its website describes the gathering as \u201ca forum to help inform and mobilize citizens across America to preserve the bedrock values of traditional marriage, religious liberty, sanctity of life and limited government that make our nation strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a little unusual to find a secretary of state, in such proximity to an election, participating at what is clearly a political event,\u201d a Democratic Capitol Hill aide said, adding that it is \u201cunseemly and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nAs a GOP congressman from Kansas, Pompeo cultivated a reputation as highly partisan. And as a Cabinet member, he has struggled somewhat to shed that image. The New York Times reported that, as President Donald Trump\u2019s CIA director, Pompeo \u201cmade little secret of his own opinions\u201d on issues, raising concerns that his views could affect officers\u2019 intelligence gathering and analyses. Pompeo left the CIA for State in April.\n\nCritics of Pompeo said that even if his official goal is to lay out the administration\u2019s approach to promoting religious freedom, he\u2019ll still have the side benefit of motivating conservatives to support the administration just ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nReines, the former Clinton State Department aide, argued that Pompeo could use less politically loaded venues to discuss religious liberty. Indeed, the State Department hosted a major conference on the subject earlier this year.\n\nReines said that Clinton, a lightning rod for Republican criticism long before she became secretary of state, took pains to adhere to rules and norms about where she could go as America\u2019s top diplomat. For instance, he noted, Clinton skipped the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., the first such gathering she\u2019d missed in decades. She also avoided commenting on domestic political fights and turned down requests to attend or host certain gatherings and fundraisers, he added.\n\n\u201cWe hewed to it religiously,\u201d Reines said.\n\nDavid Wade, who was chief of staff for John Kerry, Clinton\u2019s Democratic successor at Foggy Bottom, said his team also steered clear of any events that might seem attached to elections or partisanship.\n\n\u201cIt's not dissimilar from the military,\u201d Wade said. \u201cYou work hard to keep the secretary of state in a nonpartisan category, because the public and Capitol Hill needs to trust that they're speaking for the administration and the facts, not politics or partisan purposes.\u201d\n\nNorquist, however, defended Pompeo as doing what he must to trumpet the administration\u2019s work.\n\nHe pointed out that by speaking at the Values Voter Summit, Pompeo is more likely to get out the administration\u2019s message on religious liberty because so many conservative media outlets cover the event.\n\nPompeo is due to appear at 2 p.m. on Friday at the summit, which is being held at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. POLITICO\u2019s attempts to reach summit organizers were not immediately successful.\n\nAnother Trump Cabinet member is also appearing at the summit during the same time bloc as Pompeo: Ben Carson, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. But Carson is specifically listed as appearing in his \u201cpersonal capacity,\u201d and he is identified on the schedule as the \u201cformer director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence will also speak at the gathering \u2014 the first time a sitting vice president has addressed the summit, according to its planners.

A 2016 study by the Society for Human Resource Management found that 66 percent of employers who recruit on social media use Facebook. In 2017, Facebook created tools for businesses to post job openings and for job seekers to hunt for new gigs.\n\nUnder U.S. law, companies are prohibited from discriminating in recruitment and hiring and from tailoring job ads to a specific gender or age range. Last year the Communications Workers of America labor union filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in California alleging Facebook allows discrimination against older workers by excluding them from job ads.\n\nThe three women bringing the EEOC complaint \u2013 Bobbi Spees, who hails from a small town in McKean County, Pennsylvania, Linda Bradley, who was recently laid off from a call center in Franklin County, Ohio, and Renia Hudson from Chicago, who's been unemployed for two years \u2013 say they were denied employment opportunities because employers targeted some or all of their Facebook ads only to men, according to Tuesday's complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Outten & Golden law firm and the CWA.\n\nSpees, 35, works part time in special education but has been hunting for a full-time job online and offline for 1 1/2 years, despite a master's degree in education and a wide range of experience including working in a container factory. She was surprised to find out that employers could target men and exclude women from seeing job ads on Facebook.\n\n\"I know I am capable of doing many, many things,\" she said. \"I don't want my children growing up thinking you can't do a job because you are not male or because you are female. I think it's important that this comes to light and things are made fair.\"\n\nJob seekers are raising concerns about the fairness of Facebook ads at a time when the Silicon Valley company is already under increased scrutiny from lawmakers, regulators and users. Public trust in ads on Facebook is crucial for the giant social network, which makes most of its money from showing messages from marketers to its more than 2 billion users.\n\nAt issue is the controversial ways the demographics of job seekers can be pinpointed. Facebook's ad tools allowed Russian operatives to sow political division on hot-button social issues during and after the 2016 presidential election and also made it possible for advertisers to target ads in offensive ways such as at \"jew-haters\" and to show housing ads to whites only. Facebook educates advertisers about their legal responsibilities and requires them to certify they are complying with laws that prohibit discrimination.\n\nThe company's vice president of ads, Rob Goldman, defended this type of ad targeting last year, saying it's similar to advertising in magazines or on TV to appeal to specific demographics.\n\n\"Simply showing certain job ads to different age groups on services like Facebook or Google may not in itself be discriminatory \u2013 just as it can be OK to run employment ads in magazines and on TV shows targeted at younger or older people,\" he wrote in a blog post.\n\nLast December, three workers and CWA sued companies including T-Mobile and Amazon alleging they used Facebook's ad-targeting tools to exclude older Americans from job opportunities. That suit estimated that hundreds of employers and employment agencies filter their ads by gender, race and age when seeking to fill open positions.\n\nIn an amended version of the suit filed in May, CWA alleged that Facebook encourages advertisers to exclude some job seekers by providing age filters and regularly updated data on how ads perform with different age groups. The labor union also claims Facebook targets job ads to \u201clookalike audiences\u201d who are similar to those people who already work at the employer, making it even tougher for older workers to find employment.\n\nThe law generally shields internet companies like Facebook from liability for content placed on their sites by others, but it's unclear whether it will in the California case or in the EEOC complaint filed Tuesday.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to all nine companies named in the complaint. They included software firm Abas USA, which ran ads for sales staff; retailer Nebraska Furniture Mart, which wanted to hire staff in Texas to assemble merchandise for delivery; the city of Greensboro, North Carolina, which was recruiting police officers; Rice Tire, which was looking for a mechanic in Maryland; Xenith, an athletics equipment manufacturer and retailer, was hunting for sales and sports marketing specialists; JK Moving Services, which was in the market for drivers; Enhanced Roofing & Remodeling, which was looking to hire an estimator; and employment agency Need Work Today, which places workers in the farming, construction, trucking and aviation industries. Eight of them did not respond.\n\nRenewal by Andersen, which placed Facebook ads to hire window installers, declined to comment on the specifics of the EEOC complaint. \"We are an equal opportunity employer, and we are proud of the diversity of our workforce,\" the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2D9fxKK", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:22.808778"}, {"id": "01a2a46cf6b799c93d2eab56c64a71191e15a198", "name": "Go On A Lululemon Shopping Spree And We'll Tell You Which \"Superstore\" Character You Are", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/mwiggins/go-on-a-lululemon-shopping-spree-and-well-tell-yo-iau3", "timestamp": "", "description": "Are you a Jonah, Dina, or Glenn?", "keywords": ["lululemon", "today", "help", "character", "tell", "shopping", "posts", "superstore", "sign", "posting", "start", "spree", "buzzfeed", "know", "handy", "heres"], "summary": "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?\nHere's a handy guide to help you start posting today", "content": "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

The Neuse River, normally 150 feet away, lapped near his door in New Bern, North Carolina, on Sunday even as the storm had \"weakened\" further.\n\nPeople like Mills can be lulled into thinking a hurricane is less dangerous when the rating of a storm is reduced. But those ratings are based on wind strength, not rainfall or storm surge \u2014 and water is responsible for 90 percent of storm deaths .\n\nSeveral meteorologists and disaster experts said something needs to change with the 47-year-old Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to reflect the real risks in hurricanes. They point to Florence, last year's Hurricane Harvey, 2012's Sandy and 2008's Ike as storms where the official Saffir-Simpson category didn't quite convey the danger because of its emphasis on wind.\n\n\"The concept of saying 'downgraded' or 'weakened should be forever banished,\" said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. \"With Florence, I felt it was more dangerous after it was lowered to Category 2.\"\n\nIt was a lowered category that helped convince Famous Roberts, a corrections officer from Trenton, to stay behind. \"Like a lot of people (we) didn't think it was actually going to be as bad,\" he said. \"With the category drop ... that's another factor why we did stay.\"\n\nOnce a storm hits 74 mph (119 kph) it is considered a Category 1 hurricane. It ratchets up until it reaches the top-of-the-scale Category 5 at 157 mph (252 kph). Florence hit as a Category 1 with 90 mph winds \u2014 not a particularly blustery hurricane \u2014 but so far it has dumped nearly three feet of rain in parts of North Carolina and nearly two feet in sections of South Carolina.\n\n\"There's more to the story than the category,\" University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said. \"While you may still have a roof on your house because 'it's only a Category 1,' you may also be desperately hoping to get rescued from that same roof because of the flooding.\"\n\nSusan Cutter, director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, said the hurricane center and National Weather Service \"have not done a good job at communicating the risks associated with tropical systems beyond winds.\"\n\nOne reason, she said, is that it's much harder to explain all the other facts. Wind is easy.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says it takes all hazards, including rain and storm surge seriously \u2014 and communicates them. Forecasters were telling people four or five days before Florence hit that it would be a \"major flooding event,\" said Bill Lapenta, director of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction, which includes the hurricane center.\n\nWhen Florence's winds weakened and it dropped in storm category, he said, \"We made it very clear that in no way shape or form that this is going to reduce the impacts in terms of flooding and surge.\"\n\nShepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, said the weather service did a great job at forecasting and made a good attempt at communicating the risk. But somehow the message isn't quite getting through, he said.\n\nIt didn't to Wayne Mills. If the storm stayed a Category 4, Mills said, \"I definitely would have left.\"\n\nCutter and Shepherd said the weather service needs to work with social scientists who study how people react and why. Laplenta said his agency does that regularly and will do more after Florence.\n\nIt's only going to be more necessary in the future because global warming is making hurricanes wetter and slower, so they drop more rain, Shepherd said.\n\nUniversity of Alabama's Jason Senkbeil studies the intersection of meteorology and social science and is working on two different new hurricane scales using letters to describe danger or potential damage. Florence would be an \"Rs\" for rainfall and storm surge.\n\nThe trouble, said Senkbeil, is \"rainfall just doesn't sound threatening.\"\n\nBut Famous Roberts now knows it is: \"I would say for everybody to take heed. And don't take anything for granted.\"\n\n___\n\nBorenstein reported from Washington, Breed from North Carolina.\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

It's a serious matter. And she has the courage to come forward.

She also noted that she has in the past had \"many cases where there was enough evidence to believe something happened but not necessarily prove it beyond a reasonable doubt in a courtroom, but it doesn't mean it didn't happen.\"\n\nThe California lawmaker said it is incumbent upon the FBI to do a fuller background check into Kavanaugh and to specifically investigate Ford's allegations against him.\n\n\"I strongly believe the FBI and the people in the FBI who have the experience of dealing with sexual assault cases should be charged with doing an investigation,\" she said. \"The United States Senate needs to know who this person, Brett Kavanaugh, really is.

Holed up for nearly two hours in McConnell's Senate office, they devised a process to satisfy Kavanaugh\u2019s defenders and appease Republicans uncomfortable with forging ahead until the nominee\u2019s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, gets a full public hearing.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe majority leader was calm and even-keeled throughout the session, making clear he's 100 percent behind Kavanaugh and never suggesting the party bail on the nomination, according to interviews with more than a half-dozen GOP senators close to McConnell. He and the party committed to following Senate and committee rules, noticing a hearing for Ford and Kavanaugh to appear in a week, rather than trying to change precedent and rush a hearing this week.\n\nGetting Kavanaugh through the Senate is \u201ca big deal for him. But he wants to make sure there\u2019s a process that\u2019s fair and gives Ms. Ford an opportunity to be heard,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader, of McConnell. \u201cHe\u2019s very committed to trying to get this Supreme Court position filled as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is having to balance several competing factors: Republicans furious that Ford\u2019s allegation was made public so late in the process, especially since Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, was first contacted by Ford in July; a president who has faced repeated allegations of mistreating women himself; and the possibility that Republicans could lose control of the Senate in the midterms.\n\nIf Kavanaugh withdraws or loses, Republicans would likely try to push through another Supreme Court nominee during a lame-duck session, a move that would infuriate Democrats still furious over McConnell\u2019s decision to block Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the court.\n\nKavanaugh has vehemently denied Ford\u2019s accusation, and President Donald Trump is pushing for the Senate to move forward on the nomination. That's left McConnell with one choice \u2014 press ahead, but delicately.\n\n\u201cI believe he has confidence that the process will produce the right result,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, another member of GOP leadership.\n\nWith a 51-seat majority and almost no room for GOP dissent, McConnell is juggling the needs of a significant number of senators who\u2019ve grown queasy over the prospect of confirming Kavanaugh without hearing Ford testify. Jeff Flake of Arizona has been the most outspoken of the undecided GOP senators, telling McConnell and others that he\u2019d vote against Kavanaugh in the Judiciary Committee without a more deliberative process.\n\nFlake said most GOP senators on the panel agree with him.\n\n\"Obviously, these are serious charges. And if they're true, I think they're disqualifying,\u201d Flake told reporters on Monday, adding that he \"made clear that if we didn't give her a chance to be heard, then I would vote no.\u201d\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) delivered a blunt message to McConnell over the weekend: \u201cThat it was very important that we hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, under oath, on this issue,\u201d she recounted.\n\nKavanaugh notified committee and Senate leaders on Sunday night to let them know that \u201che wanted to testify,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who joined Flake's call to hear from Ford before advancing the nomination.\n\nJudicial nominations are in many ways McConnell\u2019s top priority as Senate leader, and he\u2019s been willing to play hardball to get his way. The Kentucky Republican unilaterally blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nomination of Garland in 2016, changed Senate rules to do away with filibusters on Supreme Court nominations to install Justice Neil Gorsuch, and vowed to confirm Kavanaugh before Oct. 1, the date that the high court's next session commences.\n\nBut McConnell has opted for a far different approach this time. He has accommodated his members by blessing a rare \u201che said, she said\u201d forum on sexual assault allegations that will allow senators to reach their own conclusion, rather than face pressure from leadership to go along.\n\n\u201cObviously Grassley\u2019s the chairman, but I\u2019ve got to believe Mitch has been very involved,\u201d Corker said.\n\nAnd senators said McConnell seemed to show no signs that he\u2019s at all rattled by recent events that have imperiled the nomination.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s OK. He always seems to be pretty darn good,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).\n\nMcConnell has shown sensitivity recently to the plight of sexual assault victims. He said he believes the women who accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual assault last year, and also signed on to a bill from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to remove rape prosecutions from the military chain of command.\n\nBut McConnell is still a hard-nosed partisan, scheming throughout the year to steamroll Senate Democrats whom he believes are hellbent on slowing down judicial confirmations. On Monday, he accused Senate Democrats of mishandling Ford\u2019s story from the moment they received a confidential letter from her in July laying out the accusations that have now come to public light.\n\n\u201cNow they choose to introduce this allegation. Not through the standard, bipartisan process. Not by advising the Judiciary Committee colleagues and committee staff through proper channels. But by leaking it to the press. Because the chain of custody of this letter runs through the Democrat side of the Judiciary Committee,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats still loudly complain that things are moving too quickly. If Kavanaugh satisfies the Judiciary panel\u2019s 11 Republican members on Monday, he could still be confirmed in the next two or three weeks.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d said Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who opposes Kavanaugh and caucuses with Democrats. \u201cWe kept the Merrick Garland seat open for 14 months, that seemed OK. The people who did that are now saying we\u2019ve got to have this done in the next two weeks.\"\n\nAnd if Kavanaugh can\u2019t be confirmed or is withdrawn \u2014 a possibility Republicans are so far refusing to entertain \u2014 McConnell is not without options. The GOP could conceivably hold the vacancy through the election and hope it motivates conservative voters enough to help them keep the Senate.\n\nSome Republican senators said they believe they could still confirm a different nominee if Kavanaugh falls short.\n\n\u201cThis fall, oh yeah. Stay here,\u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early for that.\"\n\nElana Schor contributed to this report.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:28.856647"}, {"id": "c240437ca5936c30d3706e52c03c6413b3a052d2", "name": "Why Woodward\u2019s \u2018Fear\u2019 Flopped in Washington", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/17/woodward-trump-book-fear-washington-220059", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T00:00:00", "description": "It\u2019s a best-seller, but it doesn\u2019t change what we already knew about Trump \u2014 and the presidency.", "keywords": ["presidents", "house", "political", "voters", "woodwards", "trump", "white", "washington", "trumps", "fear", "behavior", "flopped", "president"], "summary": "But the combination of decades of disillusion, along with decades of Trump\u2019s behavior hiding in plain sight, go a long way to explaining why Woodward\u2019s merciless account has changed so little.\nIt was after Lyndon Johnson left the White House that we learned that two of his top aides were independently probing the possibility of a paranoid president.\nIt was in Bill Clinton\u2019s second term that we learned of his behavior with a White House intern\u2014along with on-the-record accusations of predatory behavior by three women.\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Holmes concludes, \u201cthe midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well.\u201dThe Donald Trump of Woodward\u2019s book is a Trump we already know all too well.\nThat\u2019s why Woodward\u2019s readers, especially those who hold the political power to bring him to account, aren\u2019t barking either.", "content": "Beyond a considerable boost to the profit margins of Simon & Schuster, Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear has had all the impact of what Senator Everett Dirksen described as \u201ca snowflake upon the bosom of the Potomac River.\u201d The response in Washington from President Donald Trump\u2019s allies, and even from his longtime critics, has been a virtual shrug. Sure, cable news has struck a tone of continual hysteria\u2014Red alert! DEFCON 1! Summon the panels!\u2014but that is decidedly normal in Trump\u2019s Washington. Why doesn\u2019t anyone seem to care? Fundamentally, because, like Sherlock Holmes\u2019 dog that did not bark in the night, the political and journalistic universe has known in general just about everything that Fear describes anecdotally.\n\nWhich brings us to one of Trump\u2019s most important assets: He is the beneficiary of a steady erosion of illusions about the presidency. We know so much more about the behavior of our presidents than we once did, and that knowledge has protected Trump from accountability for his breathtakingly disqualifying flaws.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf you are old enough to remember the ennobling myths of past presidents\u2014young George Washington saying to his father, \u201cI cannot tell a lie,\u201d or young Abe Lincoln walking 6 miles to return a 3-cent overcharge\u2014it may seem unnerving to realize what kinds of presidential conduct are no longer universally judged as incapacitating. But the combination of decades of disillusion, along with decades of Trump\u2019s behavior hiding in plain sight, go a long way to explaining why Woodward\u2019s merciless account has changed so little.\n\nIt was years after John Kennedy\u2019s martyrdom that we learned that the pictures of his idyllic family concealed a reckless sexual appetite that included White House pool orgies, and that subjected him to blackmail by the FBI director. It was after Lyndon Johnson left the White House that we learned that two of his top aides were independently probing the possibility of a paranoid president. It was five years after Nixon\u2019s election\u2014when the White House tapes were released\u2014that we saw a president not only determined to cover up misdeeds, but a foul-mouthed one as well. It was in Bill Clinton\u2019s second term that we learned of his behavior with a White House intern\u2014along with on-the-record accusations of predatory behavior by three women.\n\nWhat we did know before then, of course, was Clinton\u2019s reputation for extracurricular behavior. Thanks to Gennifer Flowers, the Clintons went on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d where Bill acknowledged \u201ccausing pain in my marriage.\u201d It was an unprecedented confession, yet it was also consistent with a sea change in what we have come to know\u2014and even expect\u2014about presidential intimacy.\n\nThere was a time when presidents and would-be presidents shared little of their inner lives with voters. When FDR gave his 1932 acceptance speech, he did not speak of his struggles with polio. When Dwight Eisenhower gave his 20 years later, he did not share his hope and fears on the eve of D-Day. While JFK\u2019s campaign celebrated his heroics in World War II, the candidate spoke not a word about them when he accepted the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nLong before Trump, however, our would-be leaders began to strive to convince us not of their heroic stature, but their human dimensions. George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 acceptance speech, focused on rebutting the notion that he was the son of wealth and privilege, was preceded by a film capturing his near-death experience during World War II. His speech was filled with memories of his moving to Texas, raising his kids, participating in the rituals of regular middle-class life. No WASP elitist he!\n\nFour years later, Clinton, confronting resistance to his Oxford-Yale Law School background, told the Madison Square Garden audience: \u201cI never met my father. He was killed in a car wreck on a rainy road three months before I was born \u2026 After that, my mother had to support us, so we lived with my grandparents while she went back to Louisiana to study nursing. I can still see her clearly tonight through the eyes of a 3-year-old, kneeling at the railroad station and weeping as she put me back on the train to Arkansas with my grandmother.\u201d In subsequent acceptance speeches, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney all invoked similar memories of home and family.\n\nEven more striking, as president, Clinton was asked by a young inquisitor on MTV: \u201cBoxers or briefs?\u201d And he answered the question. We have, in sum, become accustomed\u2014even invited\u2014to measuring our presidents by a very different standard than the larger-than-life ones we apply to conquering generals or historical leaders. And in the case of Trump, there are literally decades\u2019 worth of tabloid headlines and gossip columns that long ago told us just how human he is. The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman tweeted that Woodward\u2019s book \u201cdoes not paint a different picture of the early Trump White House than the one that has already emerged from credible news organizations in daily reporting on President Trump.\u201d\n\nBut we knew who Trump was well before January 20, 2017. As Trump biographer Tim O\u2019Brien wrote in Bloomberg Opinion: \u201cThe broader picture of life inside the Trump White House corresponds very closely to life inside the Trump Organization over the last few decades and life inside the Trump presidential campaign just two and three years ago. Trump has always been thus. No one coming to terms with the Trump presidency has any reason to be surprised by what they\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nAnd herein lies the key to why Fear will have little if any impact on Trump\u2019s political support. All of the character traits\u2014the ignorance, the bullying, the delusions, the dissembling\u2014were, as Wall Street stock analysts put it, \u201cpriced in\u201d to Trump. Unlike past presidents, whose deepest flaws did not emerge until after they took office\u2014or in some cases, years later\u2014Trump voters knew the kind of man they were voting for.\n\nWhile some may have denied it, many more did not. The exit polls from election night 2016 showed that 61 percent of voters thought Trump was unqualified for the job, and 64 percent said he was not honest or trustworthy. Simple arithmetic reveals that millions of people voted for Trump believing he was neither qualified nor honest and trustworthy. Whatever explanations account for his election\u2014the massive unpopularity of his foe, racial antagonism, economic anxiety, a wholesale disgust with the political class\u2014it\u2019s hard to argue that voters\u2019 view of Trump was clouded by illusions.\n\nIn the Sherlock Holmes story \u201cThe Adventure of Silver Blaze,\u201d the identity of the horse thief is revealed by the fact that a guard dog did not bark in the night. \u201cObviously,\u201d Holmes concludes, \u201cthe midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well.\u201d\n\nThe Donald Trump of Woodward\u2019s book is a Trump we already know all too well. That\u2019s why Woodward\u2019s readers, especially those who hold the political power to bring him to account, aren\u2019t barking either.\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:29.042347"}, {"id": "2829b6a2a43692fad2eb45c532c526f7506e76d8", "name": "20 Useful Things That'll Solve Your Small Closet Issues", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/yiyang/things-for-anyone-with-a-small-closet", "timestamp": "", "description": "Time for a tiny closet makeover.", "keywords": ["useful", "set", "small", "solve", "mediumget", "jumbo", "2197", "amazon", "large", "bags", "xl", "thatll", "15pack", "things", "includes", "issues", "closet", "20"], "summary": "This set includes 15 bags (two jumbo, five XL, four large, and four medium).\nGet a 15-pack from Amazon for $21.97.", "content": "This set includes 15 bags (two jumbo, five XL, four large, and four medium).\n\nGet a 15-pack from Amazon for $21.97.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:29.490389"}, {"id": "068a03f639b6aa6f3f04116e8ec46a2589f40379", "name": "Vigil Held for 8-Year-Old Who Died After Fall From Aventura Building", "url": "https://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/09/17/vigil-held-for-8-year-old-who-died-after-fall-from-aventura-building/", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T00:00:00", "description": "The news tugged at locals in Aventura who united Sunday at Peace Park where Justin died.", "keywords": ["8yearold", "died", "going", "building", "mother", "brother", "thought", "fall", "aventura", "held", "father", "thats", "boy", "son", "jump", "justin", "vigil"], "summary": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | TwitterAVENTURA (CBSMiami) \u2013 His mother described him as an 8-year-old boy with a fantastic urge to fly.\n\u201cHe wants to jump like Spiderman,\u201d Isabella said about her son, Justin.\nSince he was a baby she said he was always on the move, wanting to run and jump around.\nThe news tugged at locals in Aventura who united Sunday at Peace Park where Justin died.\nHis mother, father, sister and brother miss said they him very much and always will.", "content": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter\n\nAVENTURA (CBSMiami) \u2013 His mother described him as an 8-year-old boy with a fantastic urge to fly.\n\n\u201cHe wants to jump like Spiderman,\u201d Isabella said about her son, Justin.\n\nSince he was a baby she said he was always on the move, wanting to run and jump around.\n\n\u201cHe does extreme sports with his dad,\u201d she said.\n\nLast week, the eldest boy of two came to visit his mom.

Her body was found after fellow players saw her abandoned golf bag.\n\nCollin Daniel Richards, a 22-year-old with a history of violence and drug use, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Investigators said Richards had recently told an acquaintance he had \"an urge to rape and kill a woman\" and that he was living in a homeless encampment near the golf course in Ames, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Des Moines.\n\nPolice said they recovered a knife and bloody clothing linked to Richards, who had completed a prison sentence in June and had prior convictions for burglary and harassment.\n\nThe slaying shocked the normally quiet college town, where Barquin was remembered as one of Iowa State's most accomplished golfers, a friendly teammate and a bright engineering student. This year, she won an amateur tournament in Europe and competed in the U.S. Women's Open Championship. Barquin, 22, was also the 2018 Big 12 champion and Iowa State Female Athlete of the year.\n\n\"It's rare, obviously. It's still very troubling for something like this to happen in broad daylight in a community that is as safe as Ames is,\" Ames police Cmdr. Geoff Huff said at a news conference Tuesday. Huff said Barquin had no known prior relationship with Richards.\n\nIt is the second fatal stabbing of a female college student in Iowa in recent months. An immigrant from Mexico is charged in the July 18 kidnapping and stabbing of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, who vanished while out for a run in the small town of Brooklyn.\n\nPolice were called to Coldwater Golf Links in Ames around 10:20 a.m. Monday to investigate a possible missing female player after golfers found a golf bag with no one around it. Officers found Barquin's body some distance from the bag, with several stab wounds to her upper torso, head and neck, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday against Richards.\n\nA police dog tracked Barquin's scent to a homeless encampment along a creek near the golf course where Richards had been living in a tent, the complaint said. Officers found Richards with several fresh scratches on his face consistent with fighting and a deep laceration in his left hand that he tried to conceal, it said.\n\n\"What did he do to her?\" an acquaintance of Richards allegedly asked officers who were searching the area Monday.\n\nThat man told investigators Richards had said in recent days that he had \"an urge to rape and kill a woman\" while they were walking near the course, the complaint said. A second acquaintance told police that Richards arrived at his nearby home on Monday appearing \"disheveled and covered in blood, sand and water.\" He bathed and left with his clothes in a backpack.\n\nInvestigators later recovered two pairs of shorts with blood stains and a knife that Richards allegedly gave to two other people after the slaying, the complaint said. Those two individuals were driving Richards out of town after the slaying, but he asked them to drop him off near the camp so he could get his tent.\n\nHuff said no one else had been charged in the case, but that the investigation was ongoing.\n\nA judge ordered Richards jailed on a $5 million, cash-only bond during a brief initial court appearance Tuesday.\n\nRichards, who faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted, reported in a financial affidavit that he has no job. Paul Rounds, a public defender assigned to represent him, filed paperwork asserting that his client didn't wish to speak to investigators. Rounds declined comment to The Associated Press.\n\nBarquin, a native of Puente San Miguel, Spain, was finishing her civil engineering degree this semester after exhausting her eligibility at Iowa State in 2017-2018, according to the university .\n\nIowa State President Wendy Wintersteen said in a statement on Twitter that she was \"deeply saddened\" by Barquin's death.\n\nBarquin was one of the most accomplished players in the university's golf history. In April, she became the second women's golfer at Iowa State to earn medalist honors at a conference tournament when claiming the 2018 Big 12 Championship. She did it with a three-shot victory.\n\nBarquin, who was ranked No. 69 nationally by Golfweek, ended her collegiate career with a fourth-straight NCAA Regional appearance and earned All-Big 12 Team honors for the third time \u2014 the second player in Iowa State's history to do so. She was the third Iowa State women's golfer to compete in the U.S. Women's Open Championship.\n\nHer former team announced Tuesday it was pulling out of the East & West Match Play in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to be with friends and family and to grieve their loss. Head women's golf coach Christie Martens said Barquin was a well-loved \"outstanding representative of our school.\"\n\n\"We will never forget her competitive drive to be the best and her passion for life,\" Martens said.\n\nRichards left prison in June after serving seven months for violating the terms of his probation, following convictions for burglary, theft, criminal mischief and harassment, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Court records show he was arrested in Ames weeks later after he was found passed out near a liquor store, telling police that he took antidepressants before drinking alcohol.\n\nCourt records show that since 2014, Richards had also been charged with abusing a former girlfriend, stealing a pickup truck after wrecking his own vehicle, using a baseball bat to smash a car window and burglarizing a gas station. In one case, the Iowa State Patrol seized a long knife from him during a traffic stop. In another, he threatened to return to a convenience store to shoot clerks after they caught him shoplifting.\n\n___\n\nFoley reported from Iowa City, Iowa.\n\n___\n\nClick here for the most recent updates: https://bit.ly/2NmE3wv\n\n___\n\nSign up for the AP's weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:32.113306"}, {"id": "69435a89fed9178c09ba8ce4b5ae6c15c031e3c6", "name": "Hirono: Kavanaugh Is Fudging the Truth", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/18/brett-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-allegations-senate-hearings-mazie-hirono-interview-220064", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "The Hawaii senator believes Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser.

She doesn\u2019t have an outsize personality in a chamber bursting with them\u2014her hobbies include making her own paper and folding origami cranes. She does pottery, too, but says she lacks the patience to use a wheel.\n\nYet the unassuming senator has become Democrats\u2019 firmest pillar of resistance on judicial nominations, refusing to vote for cloture for any Trump nominee and asking every man who appears before her at a committee hearing whether he has engaged in physical or verbal sexual assault as a legal adult. Nominees \u201ccan lie,\u201d Hirono said, explaining why she\u2019s made that her standard question, \u201cbut they better hope that nobody that they did this to will come forward.\u201d\n\n\n\nClick here to subscribe and hear the full podcast, including Hirono on the future she sees for the stalled sexual harassment bill in the Senate and why she doesn\u2019t like using a pottery wheel.\n\n\u201cLegal adult\u201d is the phrase Hirono used when she asked Kavanaugh the question two weeks ago. She says her wording was carefully chosen because juvenile records often remain sealed. And though Kavanaugh answered no, and the incident is alleged to have happened when he was 17, she\u2019s not ready to write it off.\n\n\u201cSeventeen is not exactly a baby, either. These are serious allegations. She has a very credible story. I believe her. And now we have to do more than say, \u2018Well, look at the timing!\u2019 and \u2018Well, it\u2019s all politically motivated!\u2019\u201d Hirono said. \u201cThis has to be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nSeriously, to Hirono, means another hearing on top of the one now scheduled for Monday, when Kavanaugh and Ford are both expected to testify. In a letter put together to rebut the allegations, 65 women who knew Kavanaugh when he was in high school vouched for his character. \u201cI think we probably need to question 65 people, \u2018How well did they know him?\u2019\u201d Hirono said.\n\nTrump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and others who doubt the Kavanaugh allegation and complain about its timing are revealing more about their own \u201clack of understanding of how difficult it is to come forward with a story like this,\u201d Hirono said.\n\nHirono \"combines a sense of dignity with a sense of badassery,\u201d said Brian Fallon, executive director of We Demand Justice, an outside group formed earlier this year to buttress Democrats on judicial nominations. \u201cAt a time when other Democrats have not shown any sense of urgency, she has consistently understood the stakes of what Trump\u2019s takeover of the courts will mean.\u201d\n\nOn the wall in the center of her office in the Hart Building, Hirono keeps her naturalization certificate (she also points out proudly a printed-out picture of her sitting with Garland two years ago when he came in for the meetings Democrats held in a futile effort to pressure Republicans). She is the only immigrant in the Senate, having left Japan as a child to get away from a father who gambled away their money and beat her mother. She arrived in Hawaii without knowing English and having made the trek in a ship\u2019s steerage. She is the only senator to grow up poor enough to remember what it\u2019s like not to know where the next meal is coming from. She was the first Asian-American woman in the Senate and is the only Buddhist ever to serve in the chamber.\n\nShe says she tells her staff that everything she does now, at 70, sitting on the Senate floor, is because of who she was at 8, arriving on that boat.\n\n\u201cThere are people getting screwed in our country every single second, minute, hour of the day. And if by our work, we can decrease that number, we\u2019ll make a difference; we\u2019ll be doing our jobs. And if I didn\u2019t have the kind of background that I had\u2014with a single mother who was just so focused on what she needed to do\u2014I would not be sitting here today,\u201d Hirono said.\n\nShe sent herself to law school, got elected to the state House of Representatives in 1980 and started working her way up. She became acquainted with sexual harassment from her male colleagues.\n\nShe remembers one fellow state legislator who repeatedly made noises at her. \u201cFinally, I turn around and I said, \u2018I don\u2019t respond to that.\u2019 And he said, \u2018What do you respond to?\u2019 I said, \u2018Try Mazie,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nOr there was the man who groped her in a stadium. \u201cI\u2019m just minding my own business and some guy comes and touches me,\u201d she said.\n\nThat was then, Hirono said\u2014before #MeToo. That won\u2019t be now, even if the hearings don\u2019t stop Kavanaugh from getting confirmed.\n\nHirono laughs at the idea that Kavanaugh fits John Roberts\u2019 famous formulation of a judge as a baseball umpire who simply calls balls and strikes.\n\n\u201cNooooooo,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knows where he needs to be, and he gets there.\u201d\n\nStopping him still seems unlikely, for all the Democratic action, she acknowledged. But that wasn\u2019t the point of taking an aggressive posture at the Kavanaugh hearings.\n\n\u201cWhat we accomplish is letting the American people know that I framed this as part of a concerted effort on the part of the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation to pack our courts. And they\u2019ve been doing this for decades now, preparing the way, and they now have a willing president who is going to pick names off their list,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cSo the American public needs to know that court-packing is going on. \u2026 And I hope to enable everybody to connect the dots. That they better be voting at the state legislative level and the governorships for people who are going to provide the kind of protections that maybe they will no longer be able to expect from the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nHirono won\u2019t criticize Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top-ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, for sitting on the letter about the Ford allegations for weeks. She won\u2019t criticize other Democrats for taking a more reserved approach that hews to old Senate decorum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t bang them over the head about some of the things that I do,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cI figure they have to figure it out for themselves.\u201d", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:32.356983"}, {"id": "d1a071f6a2eec7d1e50156cf41d6bc72db64d3b7", "name": "Chicago Prosecutors Paint Officer as Reckless in the Shooting of Laquan McDonald", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/us/jason-van-dyke-laquan-mcdonald-trial.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T00:00:00", "description": "Officer Jason Van Dyke, who fatally shot the 17-year-old in 2014, is on trial for murder.

Bush.\n\n\u201cThese waivers are troubling because they have to do with future events we can\u2019t predict,\u201d University of St. Thomas law professor Mark Osler said, referring to provisions in the plea deal. \u201cThey did a pretty good job hiding what they did, but as part of these agreements, sometimes the most important things you want to bury it a little.\u201d\n\nThe 17-page deal doesn\u2019t explicitly prohibit Manafort from seeking a pardon, but some lawyers said it appears to extract a promise from Manafort not to seek another form of executive clemency that could relieve him of the obligation to turn over property worth tens of millions of dollars to the government as part of the plea bargain. The agreement also says prosecutors can come after the five identified homes or apartments, three bank accounts and a life insurance policy now or at any point in the future \"without regard to the status of his criminal conviction.\"\n\nAnother part of the deal says that if Manafort\u2019s guilty pleas or convictions are wiped out for any reason, prosecutors immediately have the right to charge him with any other crimes he may have committed previously or confessed to during recent plea negotiations.\n\nOsler said he objects to some of the provisions in the plea deal as going too far to close off legitimate routes a defendant should be able to use to raise potential unfairness.\n\n\"It does appear this document was created with clemency in mind,\" said Osler. \"If this plays out ... and later we get a pardon of some kind, we're going to have a lot of questions of first impression, I think. Then, we're going to be in the courts on this, and it'll be fascinating.\"\n\nThe inclusion of a section barring Manafort from filing any \"petition of remission\" troubled some advocates because it appears to prohibit not just a request to the Justice Department but also directing such a request to the president.\n\nA Justice Department regulation blesses the use of such language in plea deals but seems aimed solely at the agency's internal process and not the president's parallel power.\n\n\"It is proper to include in a settlement agreement a provision that expressly leaves open or expressly forecloses the right of any party to file a petition for remission or mitigation,\" the regulation says.\n\nA spokesman for Mueller's office declined to comment on the provisions in the Manafort deal or to say whether they have appeared in other plea deals in the past.\n\nHowever, some attorneys said they don't think the language in the plea agreement is far from what the Justice Department has done in other cases where defendants are asked to waive numerous rights.\n\n\"It always feels like if they're not overreaching, they're heavy-handed, but it's to my sense standard-issue heavy-handed,\" said Ohio State University law professor Doug Berman.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Friday formally accepted Manafort's guilty plea to two felony conspiracy counts. It came on the eve of a scheduled jury trial at which the former Trump campaign official faced charges of failing to register as a foreign agent, money laundering and witness tampering. Last month, at a federal trial in Virginia, Manafort was convicted on eight other felony charges, including tax fraud and bank fraud.\n\nUnder the plea bargain, the 69-year-old Manafort faces up to 10 years in prison in the D.C. case. He could receive up to 80 years on the charges filed in Virginia, but the sentence there will probably be far less. Prosecutors promised to request that the sentences run concurrently.\n\nAt the hearing Friday, Jackson discussed several provisions in the plea agreement with Manafort but did not specifically address what might play out if he sought clemency from the president or obtained a pardon. The judge did note that he was waiving the statute of limitations.\n\n\"If for some reason this plea is set aside and these charges are brought in the future, you're waiving your right to say, well, it's too late to bring those charges against me?\" she said. She did ask Manafort if he understood that he was forfeiting \"a considerable amount of property.\" He said he did.\n\nLegal experts said that, ultimately, if Trump wants to pardon Manafort, he can do so, but to make the pardon effective he might have to word it so broadly that it covers not only the things the former Trump campaign chair was charged with but things he wasn't.\n\nTrump might also have to make clear what, if any, property he's trying to restore to Manafort.\n\n\"The president could make a pardon as sweeping as the president chose to, as long as it doesn't apply to prospective crimes,\" said former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy. He also said the plea agreement is replete with indications that prosecutors were gaming out a potential clemency action from Trump.\n\n\"I have no doubt that they were thinking about that as they were going through it,\" McCarthy said. \"If they're going to do this, they have every reason to do it and justify it, but be honest about it,\" he said, adding that he saw several \"potential time bombs seeded\" into the deal.\n\nThe issue of what kinds of waivers are and are not constitutional or appropriate in plea deals have been a subject of heated legal debate for decades. Some important rights can't be waived, like the right not to be subjected to cruel or unusual punishment. But other rights, like the right to a jury trial, are routinely given up in plea deals as part of the bargain.\n\nIn recent years, prosecutors began adding plea deal clauses barring defendants from using the Freedom of Information Act to request information about their cases. Last year, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 2-1 decision that seemed to reject that practice, questioning what legitimate interest prosecutors had in stymieing such requests. Manafort\u2019s plea deal includes such a waiver, but it prohibits him from making such requests only as long as Mueller\u2019s team is in business.\n\nThe Manafort plea agreement doesn't make any direct mention of the president's pardon authority. Several lawyers said prosecutors may have wanted to put something directly prohibiting Manafort from seeking a pardon, but Mueller or others may have decided such a move could provoke a backlash from Trump, the judges involved or some in the press.\n\n\"It would have created a national debate over that,\" Osler said. \"We know Mueller doesn't like to fight battles in public that he doesn't have to.\"\n\nHarvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said he believes the main safeguard in the plea deal against a Trump pardon is the fact that Manafort admitted to many state-law crimes that he could be charged with if the federal cases are wiped out.\n\nDershowitz, who has been sharply critical of the Mueller investigation, said he found \"more objectionable\" some provisions in the deal about forfeitures because they seem to obscure the connection to the criminal case. However, the Harvard professor called the prosecutors' stance in the Manafort deal aggressive but not a breach of any rules or standards.\n\n\"They\u2019ve gone about as far as they can go without getting up to the red line,\" he said. \"But I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve crossed any red line.\"", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:33.042205"}, {"id": "498e8b61d9285308809e7ea3fda00c0b6f734fb5", "name": "Let's Find Out If You're Most Like Elmo, Big Bird, Or Cookie Monster", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/lilberger06/which-character-from-sesame-street-matches-your-pe-3ld1m", "timestamp": "", "description": "COOKIE MONSTER WANTS COOKIES!", "keywords": ["cookie", "today", "help", "elmo", "posting", "youre", "monster", "lets", "posts", "sign", "bird", "start", "know", "buzzfeed", "big", "handy", "heres"], "summary": "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?\nHere's a handy guide to help you start posting today", "content": "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

Jeff Flake, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told POLITICO that he wasn\u2019t comfortable moving ahead on the original timetable.\n\nFour people close to the White House said they expected Republicans to question Ford\u2019s vague recollections of some parts of the episode and why California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member on Judiciary, sat on the accusations for months.\n\nThree of them also said they expect the president \u2014 still shadowed by the pre-election \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape scandal \u2014 to go after Ford rather than to turn on Kavanaugh, who was among the judicial candidates pre-vetted and offered to Trump by the Heritage Foundation. They pointed to Trump\u2019s history of denouncing his accusers and those who accused others, including the women who came forward last year to say then-Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore had assaulted them years ago.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s defenders included some of the 65 high-school acquaintances who signed an open letter last week vouching for his character after the allegations were first reported.\n\n\u201cI stand by the letter I signed. I do not know this woman,\u201d said Stephanie Conway McGill by email on Sunday, referring to Ford.\n\nMeghan McCaleb said: \u201cI absolutely stand by the letter we signed.\u201d\n\n\"I 100 percent stand behind my letter,\" Julie DeVol, another of the women who signed the letter, told POLITICO Monday.\n\n\"I know him very well and I\u2019m 100 percent behind him,\" Suzanne Matan said in a brief interview.\n\n\"The Brett Kavanaugh I know is a good and decent person, and I have never seen him treat women with anything but respect,\" Virginia Hume wrote on Twitter Monday.\n\nTwo ex-girlfriends of Kavanaugh who also signed the letter, Maura Fitzgerald and Maura Kane, also released statements Monday on Kavanaugh's behalf.\n\nFive of the women who signed the letter declined to comment when reached by POLITICO following the public revelation of Ford's identity.\n\nDozens of others either didn't respond to POLITICO's inquiries or could not be reached.\n\nTrump has become convinced that many of the negative developments that have plagued his administration are the result of an all-out assault by Democrats to undermine his presidency at any cost, according to the people close to the president. The people close to the president said he\u2019s likely to see the allegations against Kavanaugh as simply another element of the supposed conspiracy against him.\n\nFord told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh groped her, tried to pull off her clothes and covered her mouth when she tried to scream at a party in Maryland more than three decades ago.\n\nThe White House issued the same statement Sunday on Kavanaugh\u2019s behalf that it did last week when the allegations against him first surfaced: \u201cI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, after Ford said she would be willing to testify publicly, the White House released an updated statement from Kavanaugh: \u201cThis is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes\u2014to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA lawyer close to the White House said the nomination will not be withdrawn. \u201cNo way, not even a hint of it,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s the opposite. If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something.\u201d\n\nThis lawyer added: \u201cIt\u2019s not even going to slow him down if that\u2019s all she\u2019s got.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer, who was in touch Sunday with White House staffers, pointed at Kavanaugh\u2019s steadfast denials that anything happened: \u201cIt\u2019d be one thing if Kavanaugh said I made out with her. But Kavanaugh is saying this didn\u2019t happen. He\u2019s saying this is not true.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and Republicans on the Judiciary panel were already at odds over Democratic complaints that Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination was being rushed through with incomplete access to records of his service in President George W. Bush\u2019s White House.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unusual for Supreme Court nominees to withdraw. The last to do so was Harriet Miers, who was nominated in 2005 by Bush to replace departing Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. The nomination drew a sharply negative reaction from conservatives, who feared Miers, who was Bush\u2019s White House counsel, was too moderate, lacked a record of originalist legal interpretation and was appointed chiefly because she was a \u201ccrony\u201d of the president.\n\nBush aides were taken aback by the criticism and initially tried to move ahead. But after more than three weeks of withering criticism, the White House pulled the nomination, ostensibly at Miers\u2019 request. Four days later, Bush nominated 3rd Circuit Judge Samuel Alito, who was confirmed after an uneventful three-month process, 58-42.\n\nThe Ford allegations have raised stark parallels to the harassment claims made in 1991 by Anita Hill shortly before the scheduled vote on Clarence Thomas\u2019 nomination.\n\nHill\u2019s gripping public testimony set a potentially dangerous precedent for Trump \u2013 though Trump allies said they were confident that if Ford speaks to the committee, it would be in a closed session.\n\nOne outside Trump adviser was quick to suggest an effort to have Ford testify publicly amid the ongoing #MeToo wave would backfire on Democrats. \u201cThey\u2019re playing a high-stakes game right now,\u201d this adviser said. \u201cYou know there are a lot of people in this country who are parents of high school boys.

It\u2019s a pilot project designed to demonstrate tiny homes, arranged in a community where rules are set by the residents themselves, should be part of the solution to combating homelessness in Denver.\n\nIt\u2019s had its challenges. Two of the original residents returned to the streets after their neighbors asked them to leave for violating village rules. The village had to move about 200 feet in January \u2014 from one side of its lot to the other \u2014 at a cost of $25,000 because of now-changed city rules governing temporary residential structures. The city chipped in $10,000.\n\nBut Beloved has persevered. A year after opening, supporters are touting the results of a University of Denver study of the village as proof it is improving lives, both for its residents who were chronically homeless and in the surrounding community.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the residents here have had to be the guinea pigs, but they have helped us sort out some of the issues that will help improve the model as we scale into the future,\u201d Cole Chandler, a member of the Colorado Village Collaborative, said. \u201cWe intend to see dozens of these villages across the metro area.\u201d\n\nThe study assessed the village from its opening on July 21, 2017, through April. Among the key findings:\n\nOf the 12 original village residents who participated in the study \u2014 one person declined \u2014 10 remained housed through April. It goes beyond the scope of the study, but those 10 people are still in stable housing today, Chandler said,\n\nThree residents moved out of the village into housing of their own. Two of them, a couple, saved up for their own apartment, Chandler said. A third person was approved for Section 8 rental assistance.\n\nAnd all villagers \u2014 nine of whom were already working when they moved in \u2014 were either employed, in school or collecting disability, as of April. That fact also holds true today.\n\nTo read the full findings of the study, visit bartoninstitute.org/tiny-homes.\n\nThere were 5,317 people experiencing homelessness in Denver and seven surrounding counties in January, according to a point-in-time report compiled by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative. For Chandler, whose organization was created to help establish and support tiny home villages in Denver, the study demonstrates that more communities like Beloved should be built in the metro area and soon.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to build low-barrier housing for people with barriers to accessing the existing system\u201d he said, noting each tiny home cost $22,000 to build. \u201cWith traditional housing-first scenarios, there are a lot of overhead costs with all of the support systems that they create, which are very helpful for a large portion of the population. We can do things at a lower cost.\u201d\n\nThe study was performed by the DU\u2019s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. It was commissioned by the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, also a part of DU. The institute has invested a combined $91,725in building and assessing the Beloved village and a proposed second village that Chandler\u2019s group is seeking to build in Denver, director Rebecca Arno said.\n\nArno suspects the village\u2019s self-governing model, with residents setting guidelines for behavior and other aspects of community life, has empowered the people living there.\n\nCersilla Wolf, one of the village\u2019s charter members, has enrolled in college classes, opened an Etsy.com shop selling her own crocheted wares and began working at nearby Bigsby\u2019s Folly Winery & Restaurant in RiNo, which reached out to the Colorado Village Collaborative about hiring a villager.\n\nWolf also has taken on the mantle of resident finder. She built a second, lofted bed into her home and brought in two other people struggling to find stable housing to live with her.\n\nFreddie Martin has been Wolf\u2019s roommate since March after meeting her on the Metro State University campus. A history major who takes notes during village meetings to \u201ccreate a historical record,\u201d Martin said he hasn\u2019t had a secure home in about a decade. He\u2019s paid rent to live with friends but hasn\u2019t been able to raise the money \u2014 including a security deposit and first and last month\u2019s rent \u2014 to move out on his own. Now housed, he hopes to finish his degree in the fall.\n\n\u201cThis place has been a godsend,\u201d Martin said.\n\nWolf\u2019s first roommate, Kim Grier, lives next door now. The 27-year-old is trying to get a photography business off the ground while working at King Soopers.\n\n\u201cWhen I got this house, this was the first place I ever had to live that wasn\u2019t dependent on my emotional relationship with another person,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that\u2019s yours, where you can think.\u201d\n\nThe DU study also examined the village\u2019s impact on the surrounding neighborhood. Combining responses from a random sampling of nearby residents and a selective sampling of business owners, researchers found 78 percent of people in the area believe the village either didn\u2019t hurt community safety or helped it \u2014 a perception supported by crime data.\n\n\u201cEven the people who at the beginning of this process told me this will never work, this will be a disaster, have come back and said, \u2018Wow, were we wrong,\u2019 \u201d said RiNo Art District president Jamie Giellis. \u201cIt\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n\nThe Village won\u2019t be behind its colorful fence at 38th and Blake much longer. Chandler said an agreement is in place with a new property owner host, but he\u2019s not ready to say where until more community outreach can be done. Colorado Village Collaborative hopes to raise $90,000 for a new commons building for the village when it does move, one with running water, three bathrooms and a full kitchen.\n\nUrban Land Conservancy, the nonprofit that owns the land Beloved sits on today, is moving forward with plans to develop the lot. The Walnut Street side will be turned into 66 affordable apartments in partnership with Medici Communities, conservancy president Aaron Miripol said. The Blake Street half will be sold to local developer McWhinney, which expects to build a 16-story mixed-use building that will also house Urban Land Conservancy\u2019s office.\n\nColorado Village Collaborative was dealt a setback this month when Denver\u2019s Landmark Preservation Commission voted that it could not proceed with building an eight-home women\u2019s village on the property of St. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal Church at 2015 Glenarm Place because it didn\u2019t fit with the surrounding historic district.\n\nThe vote was a temporary setback in Chandler\u2019s view. He plans to meet next week with another property owner who he says has offered to host the women\u2019s village for three years. He hopes to get it built before winter.\n\nMiripol, who has been involved with efforts to provide stable housing for people in need for decades, said he has been frustrated by the barriers that have cropped up and prevented the tiny home concept from growing in Denver and beyond. He hopes the results of the DU study will help turn the tide.\n\n\u201cYou can have a successful community like this. You can have an impact on people\u2019s lives and you can do it in a way that is not harming the community, but in fact is very positive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important other folks step up and do this too.\u201d", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:34.671505"}, {"id": "451ba49128371dcf29a808a4e0dd5be7f142959d", "name": "What Trump Doesn\u2019t Get About Defendants Who Flip", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/14/what-trump-doesnt-get-about-defendants-who-flip-219978", "timestamp": "2018-09-14T00:00:00", "description": "The president says collaborators like Manafort should never be trusted.

The arguments are familiar\u2014unseemly witnesses lie to curry favor with unscrupulous prosecutors motivated by a desire for conviction. They suggest to juries that these \u201csnitches\u201d are the real criminals in court, not the wrongly accused defendants sitting next to them at counsel table.\n\nI recalled those arguments when I listened to President Donald Trump attack the use of \u201cflippers\u201d during an interview with Fox News after his former attorney Michael Cohen reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in New York. Trump suggested Cohen made up stories about him to obtain leniency from prosecutors. He went so far as to suggest that the practice of using accomplice testimony should be outlawed. And in the interview he also praised his former campaign manager Paul Manafort for refusing to cooperate with the Justice Department at the time.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNow that Manafort has changed his mind\u2014Trump\u2019s former campaign manager reached a plea agreement with the Office of Special Counsel, announced on Friday\u2014the president will probably continue to bash criminal defendants who cooperate with the federal government. Although it is not yet clear what information Manafort will provide the special counsel, I expect a barrage of critical presidential tweets accusing Manafort of telling lies in the face of the undue pressure from an overzealous prosecutor.\n\nBut Trump and the like-minded defense lawyers who criticize accomplices in trials around the country fail to appreciate the way these witnesses are utilized by prosecutors. They are not star witnesses, solely responsible for convictions. Instead, they provide pieces of larger puzzles. When used correctly, accomplice witnesses contribute information that is corroborated by other evidence as part of a comprehensive trial presentation.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I was part of a small group of federal prosecutors that designed a course in how to use accomplice witnesses. Entitled \u201cWorking with Cooperators and Confidential Informants,\u201d the course was taught at the National Advocacy Center in Columbia, South Carolina, where all Department of Justice lawyers receive training. Hundreds of DOJ prosecutors have taken this course and learned how to handle cooperating witnesses.\n\nOur course instructed federal prosecutors to approach accomplice witnesses with caution and appreciate the skepticism with which they are viewed by juries. We taught prosecutors that to overcome that suspicion and effectively use cooperators, they must find other evidence\u2014evidence untainted by the motive to curry favor that afflicts the credibility of accomplice witnesses\u2014to bolster the cooperators\u2019 credibility. For example, are there documents or physical evidence that support the cooperator\u2019s testimony? Did the accomplice provide information that those uninvolved with a particular crime would not be aware of? Do other witnesses who are not accomplices provide similar information? Prosecutors ask these questions as they build evidentiary foundations to support the insiders who testify about criminal schemes.\n\nThe lawyers who prosecuted Manafort followed this playbook to the letter in the recent trial in Alexandria. They presented the testimony of Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s business partner throughout the time of his alleged crimes. But they didn\u2019t simply ask the jury to believe Gates. They worked hard to corroborate his testimony. They introduced emails, financial records and other documents that supported what Gates said. They called bankers, mortgage brokers and accountants who provided accounts of various transactions that Gates described. They did what prosecutors must do when using cooperators: They built a wall of support around the accomplice and used it to bolster his testimony.\n\nManafort\u2019s lawyers were not without tools to combat the government\u2019s use of an accomplice witness. They established that Gates was dishonest in multiple ways, from embezzlement to fraud to marital infidelity. Manafort\u2019s team also asked for and received a jury instruction regarding the unreliability of accomplice testimony\u2014standard practice for trials in which accomplices testify. Judge T.S. Ellis III told the jury to view accomplice testimony \u201cwith suspicion\u201d and to pay attention to the incentives the accomplice has to please the prosecutors responsible for his ultimate fate. The jury considered that information as it evaluated Gates\u2019 credibility.\n\nIn closing argument, the lawyers in the Manafort trial each argued why Gates should or should not be believed. Manafort\u2019s attorney Richard Westling made the standard defense argument that Gates fabricated information about Manafort when his back was to the wall and he needed an escape. Prosecutor Greg Andres suggested to the jury that they didn\u2019t have to simply take Gates\u2019 word for it when evaluating his testimony. Instead, they could compare his testimony to the other evidence presented in the trial which showed that Gates told the truth. Moreover, Andres argued that even without the testimony of Gates, there was still sufficient evidence to convict Manafort. The jury believed Andres. They did what juries almost always do when faced with accomplice testimony: They convicted the defendant.\n\nOur criminal justice system is imperfect and does not always produce a just outcome. But in the area of accomplice testimony, it provides important safeguards to help juries evaluate their credibility. With Manafort now cooperating and perhaps set to testify against others, defense attorneys will have the same tools available to impugn his credibility. And prosecutors will work to corroborate his testimony by pointing to documents, other witnesses and physical evidence to support his credibility.\n\nTrump is clearly frustrated with the inexorable progress of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. But his blame on cooperator testimony is misplaced. Manafort\u2019s guilty verdict, and his recent plea agreement are simply the product of a system that empowers prosecutors to use cooperator testimony as part of a larger body of proof and allows defense attorneys to challenge such testimony with bad acts and incentives. The system generally gets it right in this area. Perhaps that\u2019s why the president is so frustrated.\n\nTimothy J.

In addition to the usual physical and mental challenges floodwater can typically bring, there is a potential problem for human health that involves some of the state's key industries: hog farming and coal power generation.\n\nHog Farms flooded out\n\nAn earthen dam surrounding a hog lagoon was breached by flood waters in Duplin County and in Sampson County , according to North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCSEQ) Secretary Michael Regan . Hog or swine lagoons are human made pits or dugouts that store animal waste. The lagoons are meant to help reduce pollution and the the North CarolinaPork Council says its \"rare\" for lagoons to overflow, but there are reportsof at least seven lagoon \"over tops,\" as they are also known, in Jones and Pender county, the department said. There are four reports from the Department of Environmental Quality of hog lagoons being inundated by nearby bodies of water as well in Jones County as of noon on Tuesday.\n\nThe North Carolina Pork Council said that the lagoon breach in Duplin County was at a small farm and an on-site inspection showed \"that solids remained in the lagoon.\" There was no mention if there were any solids being released from the four additional lagoons that were inundated by floodwaters. It said the other 3,000 lagoons in the state are in good shape so far. The Department of Environmental Quality will do inspections when they can get on location. The North Carolina Pork Council said it will also watch the situation closely.\n\n\"We remain concerned about the potential impact of these record-shattering floods,\" the council said on their website . \"We are continuing to assess the impact and expect to provide further updates later.\"\n\nHog farmers are required by law to report when a breach happens. Deputy Communications Director Bridget Munger said there may be other problem areas, but the staff has had to gather these reports quickly under difficult circumstances. The department's Wilmington office had no power and the staff in Fayetteville had to be evacuated due to flooding. \"We are processing the information as quickly as we can as it is coming in,\" Munger said. The department will have a larger report out later.\n\nIt's unclear how much waste is in the storm water, but the waste pits contain bacteria like e.coli and salmonella. Exposure to feces can cause kidney problems, vomiting, fatigue, stomach problems , skin infections and other problems.\n\n\"The industrial farming and hog farms use a lot of antibiotics. It's how you get growth hormones and get lots of animals fat quickly,\" said Winifred Hamilton who has studied the health consequences of flooding and is director of the Environmental Health Service at Baylor College of Medicine. She said they found that antibiotic resistant bacteria was 250 times higher in sediment left in houses by floodwater from Hurricane Harvey in Texas last year.\n\n\"When people are in their homes in the muck stage they really need to be protected,\" Hamilton said. Bring masks and protective gear. \"You don't want to touch the flood water at all.\"\n\nIt may be hard to avoid contaminated water. Duplin and Sampson counties make up some of the most concentrated area for swine farms in the world, and the area has already had problems with health concerns related to pollution before the flood. The flood could certainly compound those issues. An immuno-compromised person, like someone with a chronic health condition, can face a Salmonella infection, although that is rare . Bacteria and viruses could also be a problem.\n\ncontaminate the floodwater. Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette has been watching the storm in these areas with great concern. The area has already seen all-time record flood levels that are expected to increase even more. The farms that are built on flood planes, and there are dozens, will be in serious trouble he said and he expects more hog lagoons will breach before the storm is over. The dirt in the fields that were sprayed with manure before the storm will also mix with the storm water and Burdette said the state will likely see some of the barns flooded out, meaning that animals in those barns will likely die and will furthercontaminate the floodwater.\n\nCompounding North Carolina's troubles the Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Maggie Sauerhage says the state has reported that seven of its wastewater treatment facilities are \"in non-operational status.\"\n\n\"This is looking kind of like a worst case scenario situation,\" Burdette said. Burdette's own home has been flooded, his family is safe, but he said he's concerned for the residents who stayed behind and the ones who will rush in to clean up and in doing so will get the usual cuts and scrapes and get exposed to this water. \"There will be ample opportunity to get sick,\" he said. \"To be really blunt and honest there are a lot of these farms upstream from homes that are flooded or will be flooded and it will wash through people's homes and cover their belongings. Recovering from a flood is difficult. How do you come back from this I don't know. It's pretty terrible.\"\n\nBurdette questions why so many farms are built in flood planes. \"There is no way to prevent this kind of catastrophe in a hurricane like this with the way we do animal agriculture in North Carolina,\" he said.\n\nCoal ash in flood waters\n\nHamilton is also concerned about the potential health threat of coal ash in the flood waters. \"Coal ash will end up in everyone's homes,\" near those areas. It \"will end up in the air and as they clean up,\" she said.\n\nCoal ash is industrial waster created by coal burning power plants. Coal ash contains the heavy metals including arsenic, lead and mercury which can can carry health risks.\n\nThere was a failure at one of the landfills containing coal ash at the Sutton Plant in Wilmington, according to Regan. He said his department was on location inspecting the area. Duke Energy, which owns the property, is also on site doing an analysis.\n\nDuke Energy spokesperson Erin Culbert said the company calculates about 2,000 cubic yards of ash material was displaced from the landfill. The company said it is unclear how much of the water came into contact with the coal ash.\n\n\"We don't have any indication that the ash has gone to the cooling pond,\" Culbert said adding that the company will continue to perform water testing. A small amount of ash and water did make it outside the landfill perimeter into an adjacent industrial site and Duke Energy working with the property owner to clean that up. They also detected multiple areas of erosion and are doing the initial repair work.\n\nCulbert said that coal ash itself is non-hazardous, and the company does not believe the incident is a threat to human health. They are also watching two other location the retired HF Lee Power Plant in Wake County that is ok for now, but there are low lying ash basins there that are forested and have flooded in the past, displacing some material. Duke Energy is also monitoring the retired Weatherspoon Plant near Lumberton where the nearby Jacob swamp had risen to overtop into the cooling pond, but the water has now receded and the company said it will do some additional inspections there.\n\n\"We believe this will not have an impact on the public,\" Culbert said but they will monitor the situation. Coal ash does contain heavy metals that can be a threat to human health. Culbert said it contains trace elements of contaminants but she said it's less than 1%.\n\nFlooding with coal ash can make it's way into streams that contaminate fish people eat and contaminate drinking water.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist in Louisiana said people should be concerned about the coal ash being dispersed in people's yards and homes. She cautioned people to use protective gear when cleaning up their homes. She said even health threats common in other hurricanes like exposure to sewage could be a problem.\n\n\"That's what happened after Katrina. They went back and got boils on their legs,\" from exposure to sewage Subra said. There are also toxic chemicals that can settle into the soil. \"And if you go back and find two inches of yuck on your property so you handle your house and the grass starts growing and you never remove it from your yard. Then every time you mow your grass the sludge dried out will cause a dust and re-exposure over and over.\"", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:36.366767"}, {"id": "102c1916b584f4a736ea956861a4ab35592dd08c", "name": "These senators could make or break Kavanaugh's nomination", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/17/politics/key-senators-kavanaugh-nomination/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T00:00:00", "description": "The future of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination is in question after a woman went public over the weekend with accusations that the 53-year-old federal judge physically and sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school.", "keywords": ["vote", "allegations", "kavanaugh", "kavanaughs", "break", "senators", "committee", "republican", "ford", "judiciary", "nomination", "senate"], "summary": "Collins tweeted Monday that Ford and Kavanaugh \"should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.\"\nEven if the committee reports an unfavorable recommendation to the full Senate, Kavanaugh's nomination could still move forward.\nHis nomination could also be brought to the floor by Republican leaders without a committee vote -- a controversial step but possible.\nRepublican leadershipCNN reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Judiciary Chairman Grassley want -- and plan -- to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination as it currently stands.\nWhile they \"hope\" they can still have the committee vote on Thursday, they recognize that might slip.", "content": "Washington (CNN) The future of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination is in question after a woman went public over the weekend with accusations that the 53-year-old federal judge physically and sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school.\n\nKavanaugh said in a statement Monday that the allegation was \"completely false\" and he would be willing to speak with lawmakers to refute it.\n\nRepublicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate, meaning they can afford to lose only one of their own if every Democrat ends up voting against Kavanaugh (if it becomes 50-50, Vice President Mike Pence could step in and cast the tie-breaking vote).\n\nBefore the recent allegations, a few red-state Democrats had indicated openness to supporting Kavanaugh. At least three of them -- Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota -- are calling for the Judiciary Committee to investigate the allegations further.\n\nRepublican leaders in the Senate appear to be steadfast in continuing with the nomination process. Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa said in a statement Monday that he's working to set up phone calls with Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nFor now, all eyes are on the moves of a few key Republican senators.\n\nHere's where they stand:\n\nSen. Susan Collins\n\nA moderate Republican from Maine, Collins is often a closely watched senator on key votes, especially after she lined up with GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona to sink their party's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year.\n\nCollins tweeted Monday that Ford and Kavanaugh \"should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.\"\n\nHer comments add pressure to Republicans on the committee, which she is not on, who are deciding how to navigate the increasing calls for Kavanaugh to answer more questions.\n\nCollins met with Kavanaugh on Friday after reports emerged about a woman accusing him of sexual assault at a party when they were teenagers. At that point, Ford had not gone public with her allegations, only sending a letter earlier this summer to her congresswoman, Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, who then gave the letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nCollins said she had read the letter last week and asked Kavanaugh about it in their meeting on Friday. While he denied committing assault, as he's done publicly, Collins said he \"was very emphatic\" in their conversation.\n\nAsked by CNN on Sunday whether she believed Ford's account in The Post, Collins said she \"was very surprised\" by the report but added, \"I don't know enough to create the judgment at this point.\"\n\nCollins, in an interview Sunday night with The New York Times , echoed the refrain by some other Republicans and questioned why Democrats waited to discuss the letter until after Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings.\n\n\"What is puzzling to me is the Democrats, by not bringing this out earlier, after having had this information for more than six weeks, have managed to cast a cloud of doubt on both the professor and the judge,\" she said. \"If they believed professor Ford, why didn't they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? And if they didn't believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the eleventh hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it is was handled.\"\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski\n\nMurkowski told CNN late Sunday night that the Judiciary Committee may need to look into the allegations and possibly delay its vote this week. While she considers Kavanaugh's legal background \"very solid,\" she said it would only be fair for the American public to get more answers. \"So if there are more questions that need to be asked and answered, then I think it would be appropriate to allow for that time,\" she said.\n\n\"Having said that, I haven't had the opportunity to dig further into this,\" she added.\n\nDelaying the vote to review the matter further \"may be something the committee needs to look into,\" she said. Murkowski is not on the committee but her vote on the Senate floor holds significant sway.\n\nShe had not yet taken a position on which way she would vote, saying she's still having conversations with her constituents. Like Collins, Murkowski spoke with Kavanaugh on Friday.\n\n\"You have allegations out there that while they are very old -- I grant you that -- seem ... to go into fair amount of detail,\" she said, noting that Ford had already taken a lie-detector test knowing she would be subject to a great amount of scrutiny. \"I don't want to prejudge anybody, but I am one who you take seriously allegations of, of sexual assault. I don't know whether there is any there there, but it is my job along with 99 other members of the Senate to determine if there is.\"\n\nSen. Jeff Flake\n\nOne of Trump's greatest critics in the Senate, Flake, of Arizona, is another no-guarantee vote for Republicans on controversial issues, though he has tended to side with his party in the end on key votes. His decision to not run for re-election has also allowed him greater flexibility in going against his own party at times.\n\nAs a member of Judiciary Committee, where there's a slim 11-10 Republican majority, he could affect the outcome of the vote. And he's saying he wants to hear Ford's story before moving forward with the scheduled vote on Thursday.\n\n\"I've made it clear that I'm not comfortable moving ahead with the vote on Thursday if we have not heard her side of the story or explored this further,\" said Flake.\n\nEven if the committee reports an unfavorable recommendation to the full Senate, Kavanaugh's nomination could still move forward. His nomination could also be brought to the floor by Republican leaders without a committee vote -- a controversial step but possible.\n\nSen. Bob Corker\n\nCorker, another Trump critic and a key Republican vote for Kavanaugh who is retiring at the end of his term, said he believes that Kavanaugh's accuser should be heard out before there is a committee vote, according to spokeswoman Micah Johnson.\n\nHis office has yet to respond to CNN's request for additional comment.\n\nRepublican leadership\n\nCNN reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Judiciary Chairman Grassley want -- and plan -- to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination as it currently stands.\n\nThey are too far along in this process not to, and they both think very highly of him, especially after his hearings earlier in September.\n\nTo pull him would throw confirmation of anyone else past the midterm elections and create new potential hurdles at a time when the Senate isn't guaranteed to be in Republican hands in the next Congress.\n\nWhat matters is what individual Republican senators say they need to be satisfied. If those concerns can be addressed, things will stay on track -- whether this week or in the weeks ahead. If they can't, then, and only then, there are real problems.\n\nGrassley said Monday that he had asked Feinstein this weekend to join him in scheduling follow-up calls with Kavanaugh and Ford. \"Thus far, they have refused,\" he said. \"But as a necessary step in evaluating these claims, I'll continue working to set them up.\"\n\nRepublicans, according to sources, hope to have the calls either Monday or Tuesday, CNN reported. While they \"hope\" they can still have the committee vote on Thursday, they recognize that might slip.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:36.692842"}, {"id": "8281edd770a9a1e3b93393a30d5ea027dcbb3009", "name": "Ancestry.com changed how it determines ethnicity and people are upset", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/nation-now/2018/09/18/ancestry-dna-update-ethnicity/1346310002/", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "After Ancestry\u00a0rolled out a new update to its ethnicity estimate system last week, users noticed dramatic changes in their ethnic profiles.", "keywords": ["ancestry", "ancestrycom", "users", "killer", "determines", "italian", "results", "accurate", "family", "tree", "upset", "dna", "changed", "update", "ethnicity"], "summary": "My bio-mom was 50% Italian and I have traced the family tree many generations on her maternal and paternal lines.\n\u2014 Arturo S Perez (@asperez_r) September 14, 2018Still, many users remain angry with Ancestry as their original results have, in some cases, drastically changed.\nAncestry DNA released an update \ud83d\ude29 im not hispanic anymore \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29 \u2014 dom (@year2000bug) September 16, 2018My @Ancestry results have changed dramatically.\nThe new @Ancestry#AncestryDNA ethnicity estimates are more accurate, and match my family tree better, after their recent update.\n#genealogy#ancestry#DNApic.twitter.com/kh7Xclh4X3 \u2014 RF Tree Genealogy (@RedFeatherGenes) September 12, 2018With the latest @Ancestry DNA update, my Scottish ethnicity has jumped 15%, meaning I\u2019m that much closer to finding Groundskeeper Willie in my family tree.", "content": "CLOSE The Sacramento County District Attorney says the arrest made in the Golden State Killer case was largely in thanks to \"genealogy and very dogged detective work.\" (April 27) AP\n\nFind out who you really are.

Olonisakin did not immediately call out Guys We Fucked, but later shared the offending clip in a follow-up tweet.\n\nIn the clip, Fisher and Hutchinson discussed having sex with black men and complained about \u201cblack people who act like white people.\u201d Soo here\u2019s the clip.\n\n\u201cI had sex with two dudes, and one was the black guy,\u201d Fisher said in the clip, prompting Hutchinson to respond with a gasp and \u201cscore!\u201d \u201cIt was my second black guy though,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, is that your first black guy?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, um, excuse me, I\u2019ve been fucking black guys since the early 2000s, thank you very much.\u201d \u201cYeah, but you even said your first one didn\u2019t count,\u201d Hutchinson replied.\n\n\u201cBut this was like a real black guy, like basketball player height, deep voice, lives uptown,\u201d replied Fisher. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t act black enough, though.\u201d View this photo on Instagram Instagram: @sorryaboutlastnight\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Like, talk black?\u201d asked Hutchinson. \u201cWell, I just mean, like, act, more like\u2026thug,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cI don't like...black people who act like white people.\u201d \u201cAnd I know we\u2019re gonna get a bunch of letters like, \u2018What do black people act like?\u2019\u201d Fisher continued. \u201cGuys, we all fucking know when we say stereotypically what black people act like, and that's what I like.\u201d \u201cNico\u2019s kinda like that. He\u2019s got that hood swag, mmm, I love it,\u201d Hutchinson replied, referring to her ex who appears in their second episode, titled \u201cNICO: DO I HAVE ANY BLACK FRIENDS?\u201d\n\nThe clip has gone viral, and people are criticizing it as \u201cstraight out racism.\u201d this is straight out racism. and making a podcast where you think you can so freely display this racism and fetishisation of Black men is peak white entitlement. https://t.co/pIOAkJUyXA\n\nWhen she said \u201che was a real black guy\u201d I had to stop there. Then I went back to listen to the rest and it got worse. https://t.co/CvJL0ZOlz8\n\nThis is so disgusting. How can you think this is okay to say?! Drooling over him having 'hood swag' and him being black enough for you for the weekend. You're gonna get a bunch of letters because it's RACIST, you are racist and using black men as props in your sex life https://t.co/eSSOliegWi\n\n\u201cThis is what \u2018not racism\u2019 sounds like among white people when they think there's no black people in earshot,\u201d one person said. This is what \"not racism\" sounds like among white people when they think there's no black people in earshot https://t.co/gpjyblcVqn\n\nHutchinson apologized on Twitter, saying she wants to \u201cerase insensitive dialogue from my conversations & am trying to do that by shutting the fuck up & listening when people point it out.\u201d @JennaNDavis_ @Oloni @SryAboutLastNyt That was not me who said that. Regardless, that has to be beyond disappointing to hear and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t step in. I want to erase insensitive dialogue from my conversations & am trying to do that by shutting the fuck up & listening when people point it out, so thank you.\n\nHutchinson said that she and Fisher \u201chave had many conversations about why [the episode is] fucked up.\u201d @Oloni @SryAboutLastNyt I will do better. I understand why that\u2019s fucked up (that episode came out a while ago and we have had many conversations about why it\u2019s fucked up). I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t imagine how disappointing that must have been to hear.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:37.417916"}, {"id": "e722a83ce66031ca11f27b9deb0ae8702d3c41c9", "name": "Officer Mark Dallas gets royal send off to Chicago as honorary football captain", "url": "https://wqad.com/2018/09/17/officer-mark-dallas-gets-royal-send-off-to-chicago-as-honorary-football-captain/", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T00:00:00", "description": "The Chicago Bears owner asked Officer Dallas to lead the team out on prime-time Monday night.", "keywords": ["lot", "game", "chicago", "dallas", "captain", "dixon", "soldier", "honorary", "royal", "officer", "mark", "honored", "field", "football", "send", "work", "gets"], "summary": "Please enable Javascript to watch this videoDIXON, Illinois-- Dixon resource officer Mark Dallas was honored at Soldier Field in Chicago as Honorary Captain as the Bears took on the Seattle Seahawks.\nThe Chicago Bears owner asked Officer Dallas to lead the team out on prime-time Monday night.\nOfficer Dallas is credited for stopping an active shooter in his tracks back in May at graduation practice.\nEveryday they are out serving our community,\" says Officer Mark Dallas.\nDallas was honored at Soldier Field before the game started.", "content": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nDIXON, Illinois-- Dixon resource officer Mark Dallas was honored at Soldier Field in Chicago as Honorary Captain as the Bears took on the Seattle Seahawks.

Mayor Michael Hancock and City Councilman Albus Brooks attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony and sneak peek event at the store located at 1600 California St. It opens to the public at 8 Sunday morning.\n\nBrooks, who represents the Central Business District on City Council, celebrated that a reported 60 percent of the store\u2019s workforce so far lives within 5 miles of it and represents a diverse cross section of Denver. The councilman was part of the council that approved a $4 million incentive package, delivered to landlord Gart Properties, to bring the store to the neighborhood. When fully staffed, the store expects to have around 80 employees.\n\nThe roughly 30,000-square-foot store, located on the second and third floors of its building and served by escalators and elevators, has a heavy emphasis on groceries on its first level. Located on the right-hand side when coming up the escalator, roughly a third of the space is occupied by freezer and cooler cases, snack foods, paper goods, cleaning supplies and a produce section.\n\nThe grocery aisles are likely to draw some heavy traffic from people who dwell on the eastern end of the Central Business District.

If they voted against Kavanaugh, they could appear to be out of step with voters at home and risk losing re-election. Vote for him, and they would hand the president a bipartisan victory.\n\nThe claim that Kavanaugh assaulted a woman while in high school now gives those endangered Democrats an escape hatch. They can oppose the nominee without appearing to voters as if they are defying the president, strategists said.\n\nKavanaugh has denied the assault allegation, calling it \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those Democrats up for re-election from states that Trump carried, they now have absolutely no reason to vote for Kavanaugh.

Democrats are currently favored to take the House, while becoming increasingly confident of adding the two Senate seats that would give them control of that chamber.\n\nThe most vulnerable Democratic senators, including Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have not indicated whether they would side with most of their party members in opposing Kavanaugh. All three backed Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThe Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, has scheduled a Monday hearing to allow Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, to testify, but has said he will permit no other testimony. Ford has not yet said if she will attend.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, on Tuesday said the FBI should investigate before further hearings into the claims.\n\nAt the White House, Trump said he does not believe the FBI needs to be involved. He said the process should be delayed \u201cuntil it\u2019s finished.\u201d\n\nREPUBLICANS CHALLENGE TIMING\n\nRepublicans had hoped Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nomination would galvanize conservative voters while placing incumbent Democrats in a tough position of having to back Kavanaugh to reassure Trump\u2019s base.\n\nWith their narrow Senate majority, Republicans could ram through Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination without any Democratic support, but doing so might prove risky in a year that has seen a surge of women, motivated by their opposition to Trump, vote in primary and special elections.\n\nTwo Republicans challenging the vulnerable Senate Democrats on Tuesday criticized the timing of the release of the claims.\n\nU.S. Representative Kevin Cramer, who is running against Heitkamp in North Dakota, said in a statement that he found it \u201chard not to be skeptical considering the timing and history of the allegations,\u201d according to the Grand Forks Herald.\n\nMike Braun, a former Indiana state legislator running against Donnelly, also criticized the timing and praised Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cI support Senator Grassley\u2019s decision to have these 11th hour allegations thoroughly reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and weighed against Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s decades of public service, sterling record on the bench, outstanding personal reputation, and his unequivocal denial of the allegations,\u201d the Indianapolis Star quoted Braun as saying.\n\nThe two campaigns did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nFLASHBACK\n\nManley was a young Senate staffer in 1991 when Anita Hill\u2019s sexual harassment accusations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas roiled Capitol Hill. Thomas was confirmed, but repercussions were felt the following year when several women Democratic senators were elected and Democrat Bill Clinton won the White House.\n\nThe allegations against Kavanaugh have come as the #MeToo movement has prompted hundreds of women to come forward to accuse powerful men in business, politics and entertainment of engaging in routine sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cAny Senate Democrat, hailing from a red or blue or purple state, is wise to think deeply about how the larger cultural shifts over the past year-plus should affect their political beliefs,\u201d said Tracy Sefl, a Democratic consultant in Chicago. \u201cFor the Kavanaugh vote, there is a litany of valid concerns that are larger than a partisan issue.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans seemed to recognize the danger of appearing insensitive, said Ford O\u2019Connell, a Republican strategist. He said a concerted stand against Kavanaugh could motivate Republican voters to go the polls.\n\nAlex Conant, a former aide to Republican Senator Marco Rubio, said there remains risk to Donnelly and the other red-state senators if they oppose Kavanaugh on any grounds, given they have boasted of their ability to work with Trump.\n\n\u201cRed-state senators are not going to win re-election by running against Trump,\u201d Conant said. \u201cThey\u2019ll win if they are actually independent.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testifies during the third day of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 6, 2018.

But on Tuesday, a spokesperson for Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chairs the committee, said they have not gotten a response from her lawyer on their invitation to testify.\n\nGrassley scheduled the Monday hearing after 51-year-old professor, Christine Blasey Ford, went public with allegations that Kavanaugh tried to sexually assault her more than three decades ago when the two were teenagers in high school. Ford accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed at a house party, groping her, and trying to force himself on her.\n\nFord's lawyer Debra Katz told the Today show on Monday that Ford was willing to testify before the Senate. But Grassley's office said in a statement Tuesday that the committee has not heard from her. Kavanaugh has said he will testify.\n\n\"Our staff reached out to Dr. Ford\u2019s lawyer with multiple emails yesterday to schedule a ... call and inform her of the upcoming hearing, where she will have the opportunity to share her story with the Committee. Her lawyer has not yet responded,\" Grassley spokesperson Taylor Foy said in the statement.\n\nFoy said in a later statement that the committee has also \"made contact with other alleged witnesses based on the Washington Post\u2019s reporting [of Ford's story]\" for interviews with staff under oath, though the committee did not identify those potential witnesses.\n\nKatz has not returned repeated requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. Ford declined to comment on the incident to BuzzFeed News earlier this month, before the allegation was made public.\n\n\n\nKavanaugh has denied Ford's allegations. In a statement released by the White House on Monday, Kavanaugh said: \"This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes \u2014 to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.\"\n\nDemocrats on the committee began pressing back on the proposed process on Tuesday, in letters to Grassley and the White House and a news conference by several senators held outside the Senate chamber.\n\nFor the second day in a row, Kavanaugh was at the White House on Tuesday preparing for questions from senators, according to a source familiar with the process.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said he is supportive of the committee interviewing Kavanaugh and Ford. \u201cIt\u2019s a process, speaking for all of the Republicans, we want to give everybody a chance to say what they want to say,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday. \u201cA delay is certainly acceptable but we want to get to the bottom of everything.\"\n\nTrump said he has not spoken with Kavanaugh about the allegations. Asked why, Trump said, \"I haven\u2019t wanted to speak with Judge Kavanaugh because I know somebody will ask what you asked me which is have you spoken to him. Specifically I thought it would be a good thing not to, he can handle himself better than anybody he\u2019s a very outstanding man.\"\n\nThe president added that he is still \"totally supportive\" of Kavanaugh. Later Tuesday, at a press conference, Trump said he felt \"terribly\" for Kavanaugh and his wife. \"I feel so badly for him that he is going through this to be honest with you. I feel so badly for him. This is not a man that deserves this. This should have been brought up before, it should been brought up long ago,\" Trump said.\n\nFord had raised the allegations against Kavanaugh in a letter sent to California Rep. Anna Eshoo and Sen. Dianne Feinstein in July. Feinstein and Eshoo kept the letter secret, with Feinstein explaining in a later statement that Ford had asked for confidentiality. After news reports came out about the letter, however, Ford decided to go public, telling her story to the Washington Post.\n\nIn the wake of that revelation, several Republican senators said they needed to hear from Kavanaugh and Ford about the allegations before moving forward with his confirmation. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee held a staff call with Kavanaugh on Monday evening around 6pm to hear his side of the story. Democrats, arguing that the issue was too serious for a staff-level call, boycotted the conversation. Grassley's office called the phone call \"standard practice when the committee receives allegations about a nominee.\"\n\n\n\n\"Judge Kavanaugh immediately accepted this opportunity and answered all of our questions. His answers were forthright and candid,\" Foy said in the statement. \"He said he looks forward to testifying in public.\"\n\nIn an interview Tuesday with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Grassley said that, at most, only two witnesses would testify at Monday's hearing \u2014 Kavanaugh and Ford, if she accepts. Asked if he would still hold the hearing if Ford didn't respond, Grassley didn't directly respond, but questioned what the purpose would be if Ford didn't come.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he wasn't aware of the scheduling issues with Ford. But asked if the hearing should go on if Ford does not testify, he said, \u201cI think that if Judge Kavanaugh wants to come before the committee we should move forward.\"\n\nRepublicans on the committee huddled in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office on Tuesday. After the meeting, Sen. John Kennedy told reporters that not much had changed, but that the committee still plans to hold a hearing on Monday and that it could be public or held behind closed doors, \"whatever Ms. Ford wants,\" he said. \"We're here [to] hear anything she has to say.\"\n\n\"I'm hoping that she comes,\" Kennedy added. \"I want to hear her side of the story. I think the American people want to hear her side of the story. I think Judge Kavanaugh\u2014 I want to hear what Judge Kavanaugh has to say. And we have done all we can do to make that possible. If somebody doesn't show, or does show, or doesn't like the time, we're going to try to be as accommodating as we can. But the hearing is set for Monday.\"\n\n\n\nThe 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee released a joint statement Tuesday arguing that more witnesses should be brought in to testify, including Mark Judge, who Ford identified as being in the room when the alleged assault took place. But Democrats say Grassley has blocked those requests.\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent to White House counsel Don McGahn. Sens. Dick Blumenthal, Doug Jones, and Patrick Leahy asked a series of questions about when McGahn knew about the allegations by Ford and what he did about them. They also asked several questions about the letter released on Sept. 14 from 65 women who said they knew Kavanaugh in high school and attested to his \"character\" and \"integrity.\"\n\nIn a Tuesday statement, Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, questioned Grassley's plans to have \"only two witnesses invited to testify\" at the Monday hearing.\n\n\"Compare that to the 22 witnesses at the 1991 Anita Hill hearing and it\u2019s impossible to take this process seriously,\" Feinstein said. \"What about other witnesses like Kavanaugh\u2019s friend Mark Judge? What about individuals who were previously told about this incident? What about experts who can speak to the effects of this kind of trauma on a victim? This is another attempt by Republicans to rush this nomination and not fully vet Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nHill wrote an op-ed in the New York Times on Tuesday sharing her perspective on how the committee should conduct the upcoming Kavanaugh hearing. Hill advocated appointing a \"neutral investigative body\" to probe the allegations and present its findings to the committee. (Grassley has not indicated any plans to do this.) She urged the committee not to rush into a hearing, saying that \"would signal that sexual assault accusations are not important\" and likely lead to facts being missed \u2014 the timing of Monday's hearing was \"discouraging,\" she wrote.\n\n\n\nSen. Susan Collins tweeted Tuesday that she was writing a letter to Grassley and Feinstein recommending that Ford's lawyer get time to question Kavanaugh, and that Kavanaugh's lawyer get time to question Ford. Collins is not on the Judiciary Committee, but is one of the key swing votes on Kavanaugh's nomination. \"Such an approach would provide more continuity, elicit the most information & allow an in-depth examination of the allegations,\" Collins wrote.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:39.959501"}, {"id": "996b108aa2089e3c145325a6ea8a2bf3a3ee4b7c", "name": "20 Things All Dogless Dog-Lovers Do Without Fail", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/chuphanginichandrakanthan/dogs-are-the-best-x", "timestamp": "", "description": "Ooo look at her cute little paws. *Sniffles*", "keywords": ["definitely", "dogless", "fail", "came", "wanted", "cee", "dog", "buzzfeedyeah", "things", "doglovers", "spend", "20", "totally"], "summary": "Cee / BuzzFeedYeah, I totally came over because I wanted to spend time with you.\nDefinitely not because of your dog.", "content": "Cee / BuzzFeed\n\nYeah, I totally came over because I wanted to spend time with you.

Trump said Kavanaugh is \u201canxious\u201d to testify.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about the other party,\u201d Trump added, in an apparent reference to Ford.\n\nKavanaugh has denied the assault allegation.\n\nCommittee Democrats, already fiercely opposed to the nominee, wrote a letter to Grassley objecting to the planned format of the hearing, which was announced on Monday, including having just Kavanaugh and Ford as witnesses. Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, urged Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans not to \u201crush the hearings.\u201d\n\nThe hearing represents a potential make-or-break moment for the conservative federal appeals court judge\u2019s confirmation chances for the lifetime post on the top U.S. court, as Trump seeks to continue his goal of moving the federal judiciary to the right.\n\n\u201cWe have reached out to her in the last 36 hours, three or four times by email, and we\u2019ve not heard from them. So it kind of raises the question ... do they want to come to (the) public hearing or not?\u201d Grassley said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.\n\n\u201cI want to hear from Dr. Ford,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cAnd she deserves to be heard because these are serious accusations. And I would surely hope she\u2019d come Monday. I mean, after all, read all the details she put in the Washington Post. She\u2019s surely prepared. She hired a lawyer, I understand, back in August.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Trump says FBI should not probe allegations against top court pick\n\nFord detailed her allegation in a letter sent in July to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee\u2019s top Democrat. The letter\u2019s contents leaked last week and Ford identified herself in an interview with the Washington Post published on Sunday that included details about the alleged assault.\n\nThe committee announced on Monday it would postpone its planned vote on Thursday on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, and scheduled the high-stakes hearing with the nominee and his accuser to testify.\n\nFord has accused Kavanaugh of trying to attack her and remove her clothing while he was drunk 36 years ago in a Maryland suburb outside Washington when they were students at different high schools.\n\nDebra Katz, a lawyer representing Ford, said in television interviews on Monday that the professor would be willing to testify and called the alleged incident \u201cattempted rape.\u201d Katz did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nGrassley said the hearing would be televised and would include just two witnesses, Ford and Kavanaugh. He questioned whether the hearing would take place if Ford declined to appear.\n\n\u201cWhat would be the purpose of the hearing if Dr. Ford doesn\u2019t want to respond?\u201d Grassley asked.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate by only a narrow margin, meaning any defections in the party could sink the nomination and deal a major setback to Trump.\n\nRepublican staffers quizzed Kavanaugh about the allegations on a call on Monday evening in which the Democrats refused to participate.\n\nDemocrats have so far also refused to cooperate with the committee\u2019s Republican leadership. They have asked that the FBI conduct an investigation, a request that Republicans have rebuffed. Trump said on Tuesday he does not think the FBI needs to be involved.\n\nFeinstein said on Tuesday there should be more than just two witnesses, possibly to include people who Ford previously confided in. The committee Democrats said witnesses should include Kavanaugh\u2019s friend Mark Judge, who Ford has said witnessed the incident.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh looks on during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing September 4, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Wattie\n\n\u2018GET TO THE TRUTH\u2019\n\nThe confirmation fight comes just weeks before the Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are seeking to take control of Congress from Trump\u2019s party, which could be a major blow to the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nSchumer noted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to act on Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 nominee to the high court, Merrick Garland, leaving a vacant seat on the high court for more than a year.\n\n\u201cNow they are saying we can\u2019t take an additional few weeks to get to the truth of a serious allegation. What hypocrisy,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nThe showdown has echoes of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 contentious confirmation hearings in 1991 involving sexual harassment allegations lodged against him by a law professor named Anita Hill. Thomas was ultimately confirmed, but only after a nasty televised hearing in which Hill faced pointed questions from Republican senators and the nominee said he was the victim of \u201ca high-tech lynching for uppity blacks.\u201d\n\nGrassley offered his assurance that Ford would be treated respectfully and not badgered during the hearing. All 11 Republicans on the committee are men. Four of the Democrats are women.\n\nGrassley said details about how the hearing would be conducted had not been worked out, including parameters for panel members posing questions or the possibility that committee Republicans could choose a single questioner.\n\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins, a moderate whose vote could be crucial, said on Twitter lawyers for Kavanaugh and Ford should be allowed to question the two witnesses during the hearing before senators do so in order to elicit the most information and allow for an in-depth examination of the allegation.\n\nInside the White House, plans are not currently being made in case Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation unravels, including identifying a potential replacement nominee, according to a source familiar with the nomination process who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cIt would be unjust and foolhardy to think of any Plan B until this matter is completely resolved,\u201d the source said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh speaks during a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 4, 2018.

An olive-drab military forklift moved around huge pallets loaded with supplies.\n\nItems have been brought into the city by big military trucks and helicopters, which also have been used to pluck hundreds of desperate people from atop homes and other structures.\n\nWilmington Mayor Bill Saffo said that two routes were now open into Wilmington, which had been cut off by floodwaters. Still, officials encouraged evacuees to stay away until conditions improve.\n\nThe governor said 16 rivers were at major flood stage, about 10,000 people were in shelters across the state, approximately 343,000 were without power, more than 1,100 roads were closed, and emergency workers reported rescuing and evacuating more than 2,200 people and around 575 animals.\n\nPresident Donald Trump boasted on Twitter: \"Right now, everybody is saying what a great job we are doing with Hurricane Florence \u2014 and they are 100% correct.\" He warned that the Democrats will soon start criticizing the government response, and \"this will be a total lie, but that's what they do, and everybody knows it!\"\n\nThe dead include a 1-year-old boy who was swept away after his mother drove into floodwaters and lost her grip on him.

He has categorically denied the allegation, and Republicans are indicating they intend to move ahead with a confirmation vote scheduled for later this week. Democrats, along with several GOP senators\u2014Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee\u2014are calling for a pause while the Senate investigates Ford\u2019s story. Here\u2019s what our panel of legal scholars thinks should happen next:\n\n\n\n***\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2018The question isn\u2019t only whether Brett Kavanaugh can still be a Supreme Court Justice; it\u2019s whether he can still be a federal judge\u2019\n\nCatharine A. MacKinnon is the James Barr Ames Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School (since 2009) and Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School.\n\nMichele Landis Dauber is the Frederick I. Richman Professor of Law at Stanford Law School.\n\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh is accused of behavior that, as reported, is shocking for its aggressiveness and brazenness. The younger girl, physically forced into a room in a sneak attack by two older boys. The door locked. The music loud so no one else could hear her scream. The attempt to strip her clothes off. Pinned down by his body, groped, humped, unable to stop it from happening. The hand over her mouth, the fear of death. The laughing male camaraderie as she was trapped, molested, terrorized. Her escape into the bathroom, then out into the night. These are very serious allegations from a credible source, backed by some corroborating documentary evidence. In anticipation of what the victim, professor Christine Blasey Ford, feared would be \u201cannihilation\u201d by the Trump administration, she took a lie-detector test on a statement summarizing her allegations, and passed.\n\nThis nomination process cannot continue as it was before these grave and credible allegations became known. That would be a slap in the face to women and survivors of sexual assault everywhere. The question isn\u2019t only whether Brett Kavanaugh can still be a Supreme Court justice; it\u2019s whether he can still be a federal judge.\n\nAnswering that question will not require an FBI investigation or a Senate debate. It will require the court system to follow its own procedures and conduct an impartial investigation. Such a process ended the career of 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski on the basis of information regarding the sexually salacious atmosphere in his judicial chambers. Kavanaugh clerked for Kozinski in those chambers.\n\nUnder the rules of the Judicial Conference governing the behavior of federal judges, misconduct includes \u201cconduct occurring outside the performance of official duties if the conduct might have a prejudicial effect on the administration of the business of the courts, including a substantial and widespread lowering of public confidence in the courts among reasonable people.\u201d If substantiated, this allegation meets that test. Little could have worse impact on the \u201cpublic confidence in the courts\u201d\u2014assuming women to be part of the \u201cpublic\u201d\u2014than allowing someone who has been credibly accused of an incident Ford\u2019s therapist\u2019s notes describe as a \u201crape attempt\u201d to decide cases.\n\nProfessor Ford need not file a complaint to initiate this investigation. Under the Judicial Conference procedures, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit can \u201cidentify\u201d a complaint based on media reports. The matter would then be referred for a full investigation to find the facts. The Conference\u2019s procedures are undergoing improvements in the way sexual harassment complaints are handled, but are less likely to \u201cannihilate\u201d victims than the public spectacle of a politicized Senate confirmation hearing. The investigative processes take time and care to implement with fairness to all parties, making a fast confirmation impossible. And although the Judicial Conference does not have the ability to remove a sitting judge\u2014only Congress can do that\u2014it can conduct the investigation, make a determination of the facts, i ssue a reprimand and impose sanctions. Kozinski resigned rather than face that prospect.\n\nWhether that is a satisfactory ending to situations such as this one is a question for another day. Clearly, a new politics of sexual assault, building on the recent movement making it more visible, is urgently called for.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u2018The Judiciary Committee should investigate\u2019\n\nIlya Somin is a law professor at George Mason University and adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. He is the author of Democracy and Political Ignorance: Why Smaller Government is Smarter.\n\nThe woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault has now come forward. What should the Senate do? The Judiciary Committee should investigate the matter, potentially hold additional hearings, and if necessary delay voting on the nomination, as recently suggested by GOP Senator Jeff Flake. Given that the alleged events in question occurred over 35 years ago, when Kavanaugh was 17 and the accuser 15, getting at the truth may be very difficult, or even impossible. But the committee should at least try.\n\nWhat should the standard of proof be? A Supreme Court confirmation hearing is very different from a criminal trial, where guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Denying a person a lifetime position of vast power on the nation\u2019s highest court is not the same thing as taking away his or her liberty. It is reasonable to set a lower threshold for the former than the latter.\n\nAt the same time, it would be a mistake to put nominees in the position of having to definitively prove that accusations leveled against them are false. If that becomes the norm, virtually any nomination could be derailed by unsubstantiated accusations concerning alleged wrongdoing that occurred decades ago. I would thus tentatively suggest that the right standard is that of preponderance of evidence. If the evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that a Supreme Court nominee is guilty of serious wrongdoing, that should be sufficient to reject the nomination.\n\nThere is some merit to the idea that we should discount accusations about long-ago events that occurred when the perpetrator was a minor. But whether such issues can be ignored completely depends on the seriousness of the charge and the importance of the position for which the person is being considered. Sexual assault is a serious crime and a seat on the Supreme Court is a position of vast power.\n\nThe situation may change radically if other women come forward with plausible accusations of sexual assault or harassment. Regardless, fair-minded observers should keep an open mind and should encourage the Senate to conduct as unbiased an investigation as possible. Sadly, that may be too much to expect in this era of poisonous partisan bias.\n\n***\n\n\u2018This confirmation should not proceed without a fuller account of the nominee\u2019s candor and character\u2019\n\nDeborah Rhode is the Ernest W. McFarland professor of law at Stanford Law School.\n\nThere has been so much not to like about Brett Kavanaugh as a nominee for the highest court in the land, that it would be ironic if he is derailed by drunken behavior as a 17-year-old. But clearly these allegations of sexual assault by a woman who has little to gain and much to lose by coming forward should give us pause, particularly in light of everything else that is problematic about his confirmation process. Recently released documents concerning Kavanaugh\u2019s work for the Bush administration leave little doubt that he made significant misrepresentations under oath during his 2004 and 2018 congressional hearings. He misstated the role that ideology played during the vetting of prior judicial nominees, mischaracterized his role in vetting William Pryor, one of the most controversial of these nominees, and implausibly denied knowing use of stolen Judiciary Committee documents. This repeated dissembling should be disabling for any nominee, let alone one for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.\n\nSuch lack of candor, together with Kavanaugh\u2019s known statements and opinions on a range of reproductive rights and social justice issues, were more than enough reason to oppose his confirmation without reference to these recent allegations. And now we know that there is much more that we don\u2019t know. Millions of pages of documents from Kavanagh\u2019s prior Bush administration work have not been disclosed. The American public deserves better. The accuser should be given an opportunity to testify before the Judicial Committee, Kavanaugh should have an opportunity to respond and the committee should receive all relevant documents related to his previous administrative positions. This confirmation should not proceed without a fuller account of the nominee\u2019s candor and character.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u2018This accusation cannot responsibly be ignored\u2019\n\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb university professor and professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School.\n\nThis accusation of sexual assault is no longer either anonymous or uncorroborated and cannot responsibly be ignored just because of its unfortunate timing, given how much is at stake. Due process both to professor Ford as the alleged victim and to Judge Kavanaugh as the accused require that the confirmation process be put on hold while the truth of the matter \u2014 including the truth of the nominee\u2019s recent categorical denial under oath \u2014 is thoroughly explored. That process should include opportunities both for professor Ford and for Judge Kavanaugh to testify publicly, under oath, and subject to cross-examination about these charges. It is premature to consider what weight to give to this matter until the facts are fully ventilated.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u2018If this claim is dismissed without inquiry into its truth, women will learn once again to keep their silence\u2019\n\nMari Matsuda is a law professor at the University of Hawaii\u2019s William S. Richardson School of Law.\n\nWhen serious, credible accusations of sexual assault are made against any candidate for a position of public trust, and particularly for lifetime appointments to the federal bench, there is an obvious need to resolve the question of the candidate\u2019s fitness. To go forward without doing this undermines the integrity of the courts. More significantly, it reinforces rape culture: Dismissive responses to women\u2019s reports of assault is exactly why rape continues at epidemic levels in our country. Ask the women you know about all the times in their lives they have felt unsafe, all the times they have had to modify their behavior and constrain their own freedom for the simple reason that sexual assault is common, and rarely prosecuted. The world is watching. Our daughters are watching. What will people in power do now that these accusations are public? If the answer is \u201cnothing,\u201d how can any woman feel confident that those in charge have one whit of concern about violence against women? If this claim is dismissed without inquiry into its truth, women will learn once again to keep their silence. Men will learn once again that getting away with it is the norm.\n\nPeople are ready to believe that Hollywood moguls and Wall Street sharks engage in criminal conduct toward women. But lawyers\u2014the profession of rule followers? Yes, lawyers. They may well consume the same porn, summer at the same shore, come up through the same corridors of privilege as your garden variety casting couch villain. I have heard many firsthand accounts over the years from students and professional peers of harassment, assault and rape by men in suits who sign off with \u201cesq.\u201d\n\nI have met them. They come in all shapes, sizes, races. They can be charming, funny, outwardly compassionate. They practice assault and misogyny without considering themselves bad people, since they have swum in it all their lives, at the prep schools and Ivy League insider clubs where drunkfests and treating women like objects are twinned pastimes. Ask the deans at Harvard why they finally moved against those finals clubs.\n\nWhen Anita Hill\u2019s accusations against Clarence Thomas hit the news, the men in charge were prepared to ignore them. Back then we had no internet, no email, but women grabbed their phones and their clunky word processors and banged out op-eds. We raised a ruckus and forced a hearing on the accusations. I did my own research and heard enough, then, to know that Thomas was both a harasser and a perjurer. Much of what women in Washington knew, then, the public does not. The hearings were rushed and there were many stories that never came forward. As a result, we have one known liar sitting on the highest court of the land, making decisions that shape the future for our children and grandchildren. Is the Senate about to make it two?\n\nIn 2018, women have many more tools at their disposal to spread the word and fight back. I stand with my sisters of all political persuasions who believe sexual assault disqualifies one for public office. Becoming a judge is an honor and a privilege. Talk of \u201cunfairness\u201d to the candidate is ridiculous. No one is owed this job. It is the American people who are owed the truth. Nominees are supposed to undergo scrutiny before appointment. According to the codes of judicial responsibility, judges are required to avoid the tiniest whiff of the \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d We have more than a whiff here. We need to find out what more there is to know. Will corroborating witnesses come forward? In the Thomas case, they did. This is a lifetime appointment. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know because we won\u2019t investigate\u201d is not a responsible stance. We deserve full, public hearings on this issue.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u2018Let the political chips fall where they may\u2019\n\nIlya Shapiro is senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute.\n\nThe only thing to do at this point is to let the full Senate vote, with each senator considering this late-breaking allegation however he or she chooses. Nothing can be gleaned from further investigation\u2014a he-said/she-said from the mists of time isn\u2019t prone to resolution\u2014and Judge Kavanaugh has passed half a dozen FBI background checks anyway. It\u2019s certainly fishy that something like this comes out at the eleventh hour, more than three months after Kavanaugh was nominated\u2014more than 15 years since he was nominated to the D.C. Circuit\u2014and after a full slate of hearings (open and closed-door) and senatorial meetings. Even if the claim is true, how do we weigh it against the exemplary life the nominee has led as an adult? These are all things for senators to consider when they vote.\n\nOf course, all this takes place amid a broken public discourse and poisoned politics, with attempts to impugn Judge Kavanaugh for liking baseball too much or (the horror!) having been in a fraternity in college\u2014not to mention the rolling filibuster and orchestrated protests that punctuated the confirmation hearings, which were really the first Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign. Any Republican nominee is now subject to character assassination because of the apocalyptic narrative Democrats bring to Supreme Court fights and for being picked by Donald Trump, whose election the left has never accepted and whose authority to make picks has been further questioned after the indictments and criminal pleas of several associates. Indeed, Justice Neil Gorsuch continues to be seen as illegitimate by many progressives because he \u201cstole\u201d Merrick Garland\u2019s seat (though, of course, Garland was never attacked personally). The only way to end this circus is to vote on Kavanaugh and let the political chips fall where they may.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u2018The Senate must slow down\u2019\n\nAbbe R. Gluck is professor of law and faculty director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School.\n\nAs we assess the latest allegations, we must insist that the Supreme Court stand for something outside of politics; otherwise we should just elect our judges. Above all, it must stand for the rule of law. This means we should expect a court on which judges abide by precedent and so do not always vote their political leanings and personal biases. That\u2019s why it is wrong for anyone who believes in the role that law plays in our society to insist that a candidate is unacceptable merely because he or she does not mirror his or her own ideological positions. But the rule of law also demands due process. The Republican Party started us down this destructive path with its illegal blocking of Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination; Democrats should have protested as loudly then as they have now, but it is better late than never.\n\nEven before the recent allegations surfaced, the Senate\u2019s rushed and nontransparent process\u2014a process that alarmingly reflects the broader deterioration of the Senate as an institution\u2014should have been slowed down. It was a slap in the face to those (including me) who knew Judge Kavanaugh personally and were trying to keep an open mind about the merits of his confirmation after a full review of the record. The Senate has put no one at ease about confirmation or the future of the court. The very serious allegations of this weekend raise the stakes even further, and require thorough and transparent review. If Kavanaugh, or anyone else, is ultimately to be confirmed, it should be based on a process that reflects on and enhances the legitimacy of the institution on which the justice will sit. The Senate must slow down and not hold a vote until the entire record can be examined, and that includes both the unreleased papers as well as a full airing of the matters associated with the personal allegations against Kavanaugh.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u2018The Senate must engage in due diligence\u2019\n\nSanford V. Levinson is a professor of law at the University of Texas Law School and professor of government at the University of Texas, Austin.\n\nNow that the accusation is no longer anonymous\u2014and Kavanaugh is denying it categorically rather than, for example, citing it as a regrettable but unrepresentative incident from a previous lifetime\u2014the Senate has the regrettable duty to engage in due diligence. I\u2019m frankly uncertain what my response would be if Kavanaugh had immediately owned up to the accusation and noted, by stipulation, accurately that it was a one-time event that he genuinely regrets in every conceivable way. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m male (and of a certain age) that I\u2019d be willing to imagine letting it go, as it were. Those who disagree may well be correct that the statute of limitations never runs out on sexual assault. For better or worse, I don\u2019t get to vote on this.\n\nBut if he\u2019s lying by suggesting there\u2019s no truth at all to the accusations (including the accuser\u2019s against-interest admission that she, like everyone else, was drunk in what was likely a highly sexualized context, where it would not be at all surprising if a guy tried to see how far he could get with someone perceived as a potentially compliant girl\u2014we\u2019re talking about well-off teenagers, after all) then that should in fact be disqualifying, and one would hope that Republican senators besides Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski (including, perhaps, the moralistic Ben Sasse) would slow down the McConnell-Grassley juggernaut. As we\u2019ve learned since Watergate, the cover-up is often worse than the crime, and at least as illuminating about the character of the person engaging in the cover-up\u2014see Bill Clinton and his lies about Monica Lewinsky.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u2018The process is completely broken\u2019\n\nJohn Culhane is distinguished professor of law at Delaware Law School, where he teaches courses in constitutional and family law.\n\nNow we have a name behind the allegations of sexual assault levied against Brett Kavanaugh: Christine Blasey Ford. These confirmation hearings have been a maelstrom from the beginning, and, in a sad way, this revelation could end up being just another item being thrown into the vortex. The entire nomination and confirmation process for Supreme Court justices is completely broken. Even if the Judiciary Committee is forced to delay the hearings for a minute because of retiring GOP Senator Jeff Flake\u2019s call to hear Ford\u2019s story, the likeliest result is still confirmation.\n\nEven in this #metoo moment, women\u2019s stories aren\u2019t consistently heard. The president is credibly accused of sexual misconduct, but nothing happens. So, it seems, will be the case here. And the message sent is clear: If you\u2019ve been the victim of a sexual assault, don\u2019t come forward. President Trump\u2019s accusers have been ignored by a compliant Congress, and, in the context of the Supreme Court, it seems we\u2019ve made no progress since the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill debacle more than 25 years ago. Hill\u2019s conduct and rectitude have offered a decadeslong, silent reproach to the senators who responded to her courageous testimony by vilifying and downplaying her credible accusations, and my guess is that things will go the same way now. Flake\u2019s position \u2014 for which he deserves some credit \u2014 will likely allow her to be listened to, but not heard. Senators on both sides will grandstand (except, perhaps, for Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar), and no one\u2019s mind will likely be changed.\n\nThis debacle can be traced back to Trump\u2019s insistence on nominating Kavanaugh despite warnings that he would be a difficult candidate to push through on an expedited basis. The rush to judgment has led to all kinds of norm-shattering, \u201csee-no-evil\u201d process in the Judiciary Committee, as the great majority of potentially relevant documents remain hidden from public view. There\u2019s already plenty of evidence of Kavanaugh\u2019s dishonesty based on the few, presumably \u201csafer\u201d documents that have managed to crawl into the sunlight. But the rush to seat Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court begins its fall term next month has led the GOP majority to stand behind its unprecedented decision to push forward without the benefit vital information \u2014 which, based on what we already know, seems quite likely to be damaging, perhaps disqualifying. So, I expect the freight train to keep on course, even if the vote is delayed for a few minutes.\n\n\n\nIf the GOP wants some credibility on this issue, it should appoint a neutral fact-finder to investigate Ford\u2019s claim. The FBI\u2019s function is different, and Trump has managed to politicize the bureau to the point that whatever conclusions it might reach would not be accepted by one side. Then the Senate can decide what to do with whatever that fact-finder discovers. But that\u2019s entirely too rational a process to commend itself to our broken Senate.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u2018A perfect sandbag\u2019\n\nRichard A. Epstein is the Laurence A. Tisch professor of law, the New York University School of Law; senior fellow, the Hoover Institution; and the James Parker Hall distinguished service professor of law emeritus, the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nThe Democratic resistance to the Kavanaugh nomination has been an all-out assault on his judicial philosophy and personal integrity from the moment that it was announced. I have no doubt that any senator has the full and complete right to vote whatever way he or she thinks fit on the nomination. And I have no doubt that if the Democrats held a majority of the seats in the Senate, they could have stonewalled this nomination, just as the Republicans did with Merrick Garland. It is well-established constitutional law that the Senate need not call a hearing, let alone schedule a vote. In retrospect, the decision not to hold any hearings on Garland should be regarded as a wise and humane political decision, because it spared Garland and the nation a similar disgraceful exhibition of intolerance that some conservative opponents of Garland may well have launched to tarnish his confirmation chances.\n\nBut this last-ditch decision to sabotage Kavanaugh at the eleventh hour is a disgusting piece of political propaganda. Christine Blasey Ford behaved wholly improperly when she decided to write a letter only to \u201ca senior Democratic lawmaker,\u201d in which she made the most serious allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh. At the very least, she ought to have handled matters wholly differently. If she wanted to keep matters confidential, she should have sent that letter to President Trump and to Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. She also should have sent it to the FBI for investigation. And she should have done all of these things at the earliest possible moment, in time for a principled and neutral examination to take place before the Senate hearings took place. Then, she should have sat for a cross-examination.\n\nPutting the information exclusively in the hands of key Democrats thus invited the wholly corrupt strategy that has now unfolded. First, the Democrats would try to discredit Kavanaugh by engaging in a set of procedural antics and obnoxious substantive questions during the hearing, without mentioning this letter. When that strategy abjectly failed, they knew they had to go to Plan B, which was to release the letter and the allegation days before the confirmation vote. A perfect sandbag, for the Democrats knew full well that there was no time to respond to them, without causing an enormous delay in the confirmation hearings. Their hope was, and is, to create a huge media circus that would take weeks if not months to sort out. Shipwreck this nomination. Make it impossible for the current Senate to pass on any subsequent nominee before January. Then take control of the Senate and create a stalemate that could run on until the next presidential election.\n\nAnd for what? Ford, Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser, maintained a stony silence on these allegations for more than 35 years. At no point did she raise them in connection with the Senate confirmation hearings before Kavanaugh was confirmed in 2006. Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations. Late last week, Mark Judge, his alleged accomplice, denounced the allegations as \u201cabsolutely nuts.\u201d No other woman has ever made any allegation of this sort against Kavanaugh. and 65 women have written an explicit letter in his defense. Kavanaugh is right not to respond beyond his categorical denial, knowing full well that further comment would only draw him further into a vortex on which credibility determinations would be unending. And the Senate is right to continue with the confirmation vote. The institutional damage to the Senate, the Supreme Court and the nation has already been enormous. What is left now is only the sorry task of damage containment.

Asiri was reported to have created undetectable bombs and experimented with implanting them inside operatives\u2019 bodies. He had been involved in the near-miss of the \u201cUnderwear Bomber\u201d in 2009 and had nearly succeeded in killing former Saudi counterterrorism chief Muhammad bin Nayef. Asiri had haunted the sleep of counterterrorism officials, including me, for years.\n\nYet his apparent death, which might once have been a Page 1 story, got scant coverage, with no news stories appearing in the New York Times or the Washington Post. In the lede of an op-ed he penned to note this \u201cmajor counterterrorism success,\u201d former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell wrote, \u201cAmid all the controversies and scandals from Washington dominating our news cycle. \u2026 [Asiri\u2019s death] did not get the attention it deserved.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOf all the unexpected developments of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, surely one of the more unlikely ones has been the slow but steady ebbing of the nation\u2019s profound, at times almost boundless, fixation on the threat of terrorism.\n\nThe development is unexpected because over the 17 years since the attacks of September 11, 2001, jihadist extremism has come to dominate America\u2019s threat landscape like nothing else since Soviet Russia did during the Cold War. What\u2019s more, as poll after poll has shown, terrorism has been far and away the only foreign policy issue Americans care deeply about and the prism through which their sense of national security is defined.\n\nNo wonder, then, that despite the absence of any event resembling 9/11 for all those years, the sense of peril could easily be inflamed by Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign\u2014a year-and-a-half-long carnival of fearmongering and Islamophobia. Candidate Trump promised to shut the nation\u2019s doors to Muslims and create a national registry of those in the country, disparaged Islam for being sick at heart, and vowed to wipe out terrorists everywhere and kill their families for good measure.\n\nTrump\u2019s no-holds barred demagoguery\u2014building on years of political parties jousting over the terrorist threat and its related wars, media coverage that was often supersaturated, and actual attacks in California and Florida during the presidential campaign\u2014helped drive concern over terrorism to a peak. In 2015, for the only time in a decade, terrorism tied the economy as the No. 1 concern of Americans. Fully 51 percent of those Americans polled in late 2015 said they feared they or someone in their family would be a victim of terrorist violence, and multiple surveys found large numbers of Americans saying they believed the threat was greater than at any time since 9/11. In the election, terrorism was the No. 2 issue of concern for voters, with 80 percent of voters citing it\u2014just 4 points behind the economy.\n\nAll indications suggested that this campaign was only the beginning\u2014that a broadened counterterrorism crusade and energized fear-fanning lay in store after the just-inaugurated Trump vowed to \u201cunite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d which, he promised, the world would \u201ceradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\u201d Indeed, the new administration immediately rolled out the first draft of the executive order blocking entry to the U.S. for citizens from seven Muslim countries. The drama of that effort played out across courtrooms from Maryland to Hawaii over 18 months and concluded with a 5-4 Supreme Court decision upholding a ban that had gone through multiple rounds of cosmetic surgery so it could pass muster with the justices.\n\nBut while the ban worked its way through the courts, it became clear that Trump had done little else to keep the focus on terrorism. He swore during the campaign that he had a secret plan for destroying ISIS, but none was ever unveiled. The fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria continued largely along the lines conceived in the Obama administration, though the Trump team removed some targeting restrictions, increasing significantly the amount of ordnance dropped and the number of civilian casualties.\n\nPerhaps most important, Trump scandals have swept away all before them, refocusing public attention on the question of campaign collusion with Russia, trade wars, chaos in the White House, attacks against the press and such contretemps as stripping former CIA chief John Brennan of his security clearance. The media, a central player in the feedback mechanism of public opinion, redirected its energies, and today only a small fraction of terrorism stories make the front page of the dailies compared with only a few years ago.\n\nAt the New York Times, star reporters with experience in intelligence and law enforcement such as Mark Mazzetti, Scott Shane and Adam Goldman have been reassigned to the Trump maelstrom. Greg Miller, the Washington Post\u2019s stalwart terrorism and intelligence reporter, has been anchoring that paper\u2019s book on Trump and Russia. In the endless panel discussion of Trumpian outrages that CNN has become, former CIA official Phil Mudd no longer dissects the details of jihadist plots but contextualizes White House misdeeds and vents his well-founded anger at White House shenanigans.\n\nWhile some might claim the decline in coverage reflects a decline in terrorist activity, that argument is weak: The New York City rental truck attack on October 31, 2017, that killed eight caused more fatalities than all but three incidents in the U.S. since 9/11. The attack received a fraction of the attention of earlier terrorist events.\n\nPolling gives only limited help in determining public concern today about terrorism: Most surveys on the subject are conducted right after attacks. Interestingly, there wasn\u2019t one after the New York City incident, and there haven\u2019t been many others of late. Gallup found in March that 40 percent of those asked were very concerned about future terrorist attacks in the U.S., a notable decline from 48 percent in 2016. (For comparison: The number in 2002, just months after 9/11 was 49 percent.)\n\nTrump himself appears to have forgotten about the subject. Talk of terrorism has virtually disappeared from his shambolic rally performances. When he spoke in Phoenix late last month, he flogged a long decomposed horse by criticizing former President Barack Obama for refusing to use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d and then boasted briefly about extreme vetting. At a late July rally in Tampa, Florida, he made no mention of the subject at all.\n\nThe lull in attention to terrorism raises questions: Is this a good thing? If so, is it durable?\n\nThe answer to the first is, on balance, yes. U.S. public opinion had become a runaway train on issue of terrorism, to the detriment of our broader interests. That\u2019s a natural consequence of a political debate on terrorism that had lost touch with reality\u2014as when, in 2014, Senator Lindsey Graham declared on \"Fox News Sunday,\" \u201cI think of an American city in flames because of the terrorists\u2019 ability to operate in Syria and Iraq.\u201d\n\nThough partisans on both sides of the aisle take the terrorist threat seriously, Republicans tend to rate it as substantially greater concern, typically by a margin of 20 or more percentage points. In New Hampshire, where I work, 2016 Republican presidential primary candidates such as Chris Christie and Marco Rubio spoke about their determination to allay the fears about imminent attack they heard from the inhabitants in the tiny towns and villages of the state\u2014a scenario of almost indescribable preposterousness. All of this took place in an America where the chances of being killed by a foreign terrorist were infinitesimal.\n\nWithin the government, the consequences of the terrorism fixation were also manifest. Former White House Coordinator for the Middle East Rob Malley and former State Department chief of staff Jon Finer have written in Foreign Affairs about how the counterterrorism machinery competed with\u2014and ran afoul of\u2014the rest of the foreign policy process in the second Obama term:\n\n\n\nIn one example from our time in government, in 2016, officials taking part in the more specialized counterterrorism side of the process debated whether to kill or capture a particular militant leader even as those involved in the parallel interagency process considered whether to initiate political discussions with him. That same year, those involved in the counterterrorism process recommended launching a major strike against ISIS leaders in Libya even as other officials working on that country worried that overt U.S. military action would undermine Libya\u2019s fledgling government.\n\nFor the record, Malley and Finer describe a policy process far more tangled and convoluted than the one I knew in the first Obama term. Both, however, are acute observers, and I have no reason to doubt their account. It is hard to imagine that the time spent on terrorism did not also limit the administration\u2019s bandwidth for other matters. Historians one day will undoubtedly examine whether more attention should have been paid to a Russia whose behavior had grown in a few years from episodically difficult to deeply hostile.\n\nOne important benefit of the declining obsession with terrorism is that it has allowed the biggest agency in the government, the Defense Department\u2014which appears to have recognized U.S. over-investment in one threat area\u2014to begin reallocating resources. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis early in the year unveiled a new National Defense Strategy in which the threat of extremist violence was replaced by \u201cgrowing threats from revisionist powers as different as China and Russia.\u201d\n\nGiven that the \u201chigh-end threat\u201d from Al Qaeda to carry out catastrophic attacks that kill thousands (other groups like ISIS are less interested in this kind of complex covert operation and are more attracted to holding territory) appears to have been reduced by that group\u2019s disarray, while Russia seeks to undermine the global rules-based order and China works to expand its influence on several continents, this change is appropriate if not overdue. One of the Pentagon\u2019s first steps in its rebalancing has been to direct a reduction in operations in Africa, which has triggered a predictable bureaucratic food fight over priorities. It remains to be seen whether this decrease will diminish the capabilities of poor but determined countries like Niger to strengthen their counterterrorism efforts.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that the terrorist threat is over and won\u2019t come back. Although ISIS has been defeated in Iraq, many analysts believe the group still has plenty of fighters in the field who went to ground instead of trying to combat a vastly more powerful foe, and that the group will mount an offensive sometime soon. Terrorist groups thrive in conflict zones, and the continuing chaos in Yemen is a perfect setting for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to grow its forces. The challenge of dealing with foreign fighters returning from Iraq and Syria continues to occupy governments around the world. While the level of terrorist violence globally has been declining for the past couple of years, it is nonetheless at a historically high level and isn\u2019t likely to fall off sharply anytime in the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd these are just the challenges of the moment. Jihadism will remain a potent force for years, and probably decades to come, for several reasons: With a few exceptions, especially among the oil monarchies, the Middle East and such Muslim majority countries as Pakistan remain in poor, sometimes disastrous shape. Economic stagnation is endemic, with job creation a shadow of what it should be. Most people in the region lack real political voice or representative institutions. In the West, especially in Europe, integration of Muslim minority communities is uneven at best, leaving many frustrated at their limited prospects. These big structural facts aren\u2019t going to change quickly. The United States will need to continue investing in counterterrorism for a long time to come.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s worth recognizing the America is well protected by excellent border controls, capable law enforcement and remarkable intelligence and military capabilities\u2014as the targeting of Asiri underscores. With barely more than 100 people killed in the United States by jihadist operatives since 9/11, the record is a strong one that argues for taking this moment to revise our collective thinking about the terrorist threat. That is, the time has come to absorb the notion that jihadist terrorism is a fact of the contemporary world, that it can be managed but not eradicated and that we have developed excellent though not perfect tools for that task. That understanding, it seems to me, is the precondition for avoiding the kind of overreaction that helped lead us into Iraq and created near hysteria in 2014 when ISIS appeared on the scene.\n\nWill those realizations sink in? The president might be talking less about ISIS, but America continues to be in the grip of a Trump-accelerated xenophobia, as his continued emphasis on cutting off immigration and the rise in hate crimes since he launched his campaign has demonstrated. And it\u2019s unlikely that our president is committed to the Pentagon\u2019s new focus: Considering his campaign platform and his much-noted warmth toward Russia, one has to wonder whether Trump even read the cover memo on Mattis\u2019 document reordering U.S. defense priorities when it crossed his desk for approval.\n\nIn light of over-the-top polarization, there is no reason to believe that our politicians won\u2019t revert to the kind of outbidding on terrorism that had prodded the expansion of the counterterrorism machinery at the expense of so much else. And the nature of the media hasn\u2019t changed: If anything, social media seems to be increasing the reverberation of news opinion that feeds outsize anxieties. A lot may depend on how much time there is until the next substantial attack, and, of course, what that event looks like. It\u2019s not a test I\u2019m looking forward to.\n\nAmbassador Daniel Benjamin is director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College and served as coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department 2009-2012.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:45.473897"}, {"id": "0675b5d1d03d2751a566fc6be57e3b157902edbb", "name": "Happy update for Florence, the endangered Brother Wolf kitten", "url": "https://wlos.com/news/local/happy-update-for-florence-the-endangered-brother-wolf-kitten", "timestamp": "", "description": "We have a happy update on a little kitten named after the hurricane.

It is the lowest number in the history of the nearly 40-year-old resettlement program. In so doing, he answered the depressing question experts have been asking for the past several weeks: Would the administration stay put at the record-low level it set for itself in 2018 \u2014 45,000 refugees \u2014 or seek to plumb new depths in the coming year?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn any normal administration, the State Department, which runs the refugee resettlement program, would have led the charge in arguing for a number that better represents the United States\u2019 capacity and humanitarian traditions \u2014 something closer to the historical average of 80,000. But in the Trump era, allies of immigration uber-hawk Stephen Miller have occupied key positions at State, virtually guaranteeing that leadership would not come out of Foggy Bottom. Instead, it was reportedly left to the Department of Defense to point out what is actually true: Refugee resettlement creates goodwill, rewards the loyalty of local partners who risk their lives to help U.S. personnel in places like Iraq, can help stabilize host countries bordering conflict zones, and makes it easier to ask the states bearing the brunt of the refugee burden to stretch even further in the humanitarian support they provide.\n\nBut however hard or well the Pentagon might have argued, the odds were never with them. Close observers of this administration\u2019s refugee policy suggested to us that the writing was on the wall months ago. The White House would lower the ceiling further into the historical basement, arguing that the program\u2019s pathetic 2018 performance (the U.S. has actually admitted roughly 25,000 refugees, the lowest number in its history, and well short of the ceiling of 45,000) indicated a lack of capacity, and that it could hardly be expected to do better in the coming fiscal year. By way of further excuses, the administration could rely on its now familiar set of anti-resettlement tropes\u2014pointing out America\u2019s generosity with foreign aid (a point that would be more powerful if the administration had not worked so assiduously to slash assistance budgets) and arguing that resettlement personnel are needed to help adjudicate a growing backlog of asylum cases.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not too far from how things actually played out. In his relatively thin remarks Monday explaining why the administration was lowering the ceiling, Pompeo did indeed invoke U.S. assistance generosity, while awkwardly referring both to the number of refugees the United States expects to consider for resettlement next year and the number of asylees it expects to process. (Never mind that the resettlement program, which creates a legal pathway to bring vetted refugees from all corners of the globe to the United States, and asylum processing, which deals with people who come to the border under their own steam, are legally and operationally distinct.) There is every reason to expect the administration and its allies will roll out a fuller suite of excuses over the coming days.\n\nIf past is prologue, they will be largely nonsense. Let\u2019s start with the idea that the U.S. government\u2019s poor performance in 2018 was an actual reflection of its capacity. As a report just released by International Crisis Group shows, the poor 2018 numbers were the product of a conscious process of bureaucratic strangulation. Resettlement suffered because of a politically motivated suspension in 2017 that had huge ripple effects on resettlement logistics. It also suffered because of new vetting requirements, molasses-slow caseload processing, and the malign neglect of a White House that gives every indication of wanting the program to go away. When the Bush and Obama administrations (one of us worked under Obama, the other under both) hit snags with the resettlement program, they threw themselves into fixing the problem. Not this White House. They\u2019re \u201ctickled pink,\u201d one official told us.\n\nBut while the administration\u2019s hostility toward refugees is hardly unexpected \u2014candidate Donald Trump made Syrian refugees into a campaign issue \u2014 it is still difficult to find a rational explanation. The usual anti-immigration tropes don\u2019t make much sense in the context of refugee resettlement. It can\u2019t be, for example, that the administration sincerely worries about uncontrolled waves of resettled refugees driving down wages for low-skilled workers. Refugees who come through the resettlement program don\u2019t come in uncontrolled waves. Their numbers are capped, and at levels way too low to have a meaningful impact on wages.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to believe the White House is really concerned about the burden refugees place on U.S. taxpayers. Indeed, the Department of Health and Human Services prepared a draft report last year showing that resettled refugees produced a net economic benefit of $63 billion for the period 2005 to 2014. The White House accused the drafters of political bias and buried the report.\n\nNor do security concerns seem the source of the administration\u2019s animus toward resettlement. If they were, then presumably the White House would have insisted on hearing out the National Counterterrorism Center\u2019s non-alarmist assessment when they reportedly tried to brief it to senior officials last year. Instead, a senior Justice Department representative dismissed the findings without analysis. As a former Trump White House official told Crisis Group, it was clear at that moment that, \u201cfacts weren\u2019t going to matter.\u201d\n\nFinally, what about the argument that the administration needs to take personnel off the resettlement beat to work through hundreds of thousands of backlogged asylum claims? No sale. Reducing the asylum backlog is a massive and important job, but it could take several thousand employees to do it well and quickly. The administration needs a real plan. They must know that stealing several dozen refugee interviewers is neither necessary nor sufficient to the task.\n\nGiven that these justifications don\u2019t hold up, maybe we need to consider one further possibility. Maybe the administration\u2019s posture toward refugees is about something that no economic study or security regime or personnel infusion can fix. Maybe it\u2019s about who the refugees are. After all, this is a president who called a major swathe of the global south \u201cshithole countries,\u201d who pined for higher levels of Norwegian migration, and whose administration draws policy inspiration from polemicists like Ann Coulter \u2014 who has described human diversity as a \u201ctrain wreck.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s true, if that\u2019s what is driving the administration\u2019s war against a program that has provided transformative assistance to more than three million people over nearly four decades, and projected America\u2019s best face to the world, then it\u2019s time to come clean. The flimsy justifications the administration has offered don\u2019t compute. They should invite the American people to judge them on the strength of their bitter convictions.\n\nRobert Malley is president and CEO of the International Crisis Group.

Trump particularly outperformed his Republican predecessors with working-class white men over 55, perhaps because he promised to revive the state\u2019s shuttered mines and mills, perhaps because he lashed out at corporate and Wall Street elites as well as immigrants and minorities, perhaps because he came off as an unfiltered outsider to a demographic that didn\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton or politics as usual. And as president, Trump has imposed tariffs against partners like Canada and the European Union as well as competitors like China, vowing to protect America\u2019s industrial heartland by rejecting globalization.\n\nImage Top: Republic Steel in Lorain, Ohio, where production partially restarted in September, bringing 80 new jobs to the city.

Meanwhile, Brown is trouncing his Trump-loving Republican challenger, Rep. Jim Renacci, by 16 points, perhaps because he comes off as the kind of Washington insider who battles to save working men\u2019s pensions, perhaps because the GOP\u2019s hold on America\u2019s manufacturing base is slipping. In 2018, Trump country looks more like Brown country\u2014and many lesser-known Ohio Democrats think they can follow his populist path to victory, in part by persuading older blue-collar voters that only one party cares about their economic security.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear all kinds of opinions about Trump, but everyone in this room knows Sherrod works his tail off for us,\u201d says Jeff Wharton, a 73-year-old former Marine who spent three years in Vietnam and then 48 years in the coal mines.\n\nTrump\u2019s numbers in Ohio are not as bad as they are nationally, but twice as many strongly disapprove as strongly approve, a dangerous sign for Republicans who usually rely on an intensity advantage in off-year elections. It\u2019s tempting for Democrats to rally their base by taking shots at Trump\u2019s chaotic, reality-show presidency, and Brown couldn\u2019t resist sniping during his pension event that \u201cthis White House is like a retreat for Wall Street executives.\u201d But Brown\u2019s campaign strategy is mostly about bashing the industry-friendly Republican agenda without dwelling on the president who\u2019s driving it. He\u2019s running the traditional Democratic playbook of progressive pocketbook issues, promising workers he\u2019ll keep pushing to protect their health care, retirement security and bargaining rights, while fighting the efforts of Republicans like Renacci to cut their bosses\u2019 taxes.\n\nIt\u2019s basically the same playbook Democrats have run on for decades. But while proudly socialist candidates like Bernie Sanders and New York\u2019s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez soak up national attention, Ohio Democrats believe this familiar meat-and-potatoes strategy can help them reclaim this weather-vane state in 2018, and win back some of the older voters who have been drawn to the GOP\u2019s culture-based appeals. There was already a canary-in-the-coal-mine moment last month when Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor, a young county recorder of deeds, nearly upset a better-known and better-funded Republican state senator in a special election to represent a staunchly Republican congressional district around Columbus. Democrats have a chance to flip several swingier Ohio districts in November, and former Democratic state attorney general Richard Cordray, after taking on Wall Street as head of Obama\u2019s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is in a tight race for governor against current Attorney General Mike DeWine. While cable news may be all-Trump-all-the-time, the Democratic message in all those races has been much more about insurance premiums, school funding and Social Security than the Russia investigation, Stormy Daniels or Trump\u2019s tweets. Democrats figure the midterms will be a referendum on Trump no matter what they say about him, so they aren\u2019t saying much about him.\n\nTop: At the Lorain County Labor Day Festival, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown delivers a campaign speech.

Ohio was trending red even before Trump; Brown and Obama are the only Democrats who have won statewide elections here in the past decade. Republicans dominate the state Legislature as well, and their older white base has been much more reliable about midterm turnout than the minorities and millennials who tend to vote Democratic. Republican candidates should also benefit from a strong economy that\u2019s been growing for nine years, even though wages remain stagnant. And while Trump has been far more accommodating to corporate America and Wall Street than he vowed to be as a candidate, he has continued his populist attacks on free trade, disrupting the status quo in ways that could please Ohio workers who see globalization as the enemy of U.S. manufacturing.\n\nNew Window Ohio\u2019s Deciders in Their Own Words: Buckeye State voters over 50 have strong opinions about President Trump, the economy and the other political party. (CLICK TO OPEN)\n\nStill, the laws of political gravity apply. The national landscape looks bleak for Republicans, and the Ohio GOP is divided between ardent fans of the president and more establishment-oriented supporters of Governor John Kasich, a potential 2020 primary challenger who recently skipped the state party convention after the president was booked to speak. Republicans have also been embroiled in scandals involving charter schools and payday lenders in Columbus, not to mention the indictments, plea deals and other embarrassing dramas dominating the news out of Washington. Meanwhile, the Democratic base seems unusually fired up to take out its frustrations at the polls. And after two years of Republicans catering primarily to their own base, Democrats are betting that more persuadable voters will reject what they\u2019re framing as the GOP agenda of slashing high-end taxes, rolling back health and safety regulations, supporting industry-friendly judges, and repealing Obamacare\u2014now that the alternative isn\u2019t Hillary Clinton. What they don\u2019t want is another personality contest domineered by a big-talking billionaire with a flair for attention and distraction, which is why the AFL-CIO\u2019s 2018 get-serious message to its members, plastered all over Ohio\u2019s union halls, is: \u201cIssues Matter. Vote Union.\u201d\n\nThe subtext of a lot of coverage of the white working class has been that issues don\u2019t matter much, because Trump voters love Trump, no matter what he does or tweets. That\u2019s true for many of them, but not all of them, which is why his approval rating has dipped to potential blue-wave levels. Al Stapleton, a 72-year-old retired Teamster from Brunswick, says he voted for Trump to kick corporate asses and drain the Washington swamp, only to see the president attack unions, dismantle Wall Street regulations and ignore the threat to his $3,000-a-month pension. \u201cThe guy talked a good game, and I\u2019ll admit it, I got hornswoggled,\u201d Stapleton said before Brown\u2019s talk. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about working people. We\u2019re dirt under his feet.\u201d\n\nVoters don\u2019t always fit into neat socioeconomic stereotypes. Several retirees who came to see Brown discuss their pensions in Cambridge were still fuming about Clinton\u2019s breezy observation on a visit to Ohio that she would \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d But Don Cameron, a self-described Reagan Democrat wearing a camouflage United Mine Workers T-shirt, said he\u2019s far more upset about Trump\u2019s apathetic response to Hurricane Maria: \u201cHe said he did so much for Puerto Rico? What a joke!\u201d Wharton, the blunt-spoken Vietnam vet, brought up Trump\u2019s change-the-subject attacks on black athletes who kneel during the national anthem, then surprised me by siding with the protesters.\n\nTop: At Gene's Barber Shop in Salem, Ohio, the talk of the day is Nike and Colin Kaepernick. Bottom: An Ohio man waters the flowers outside his house. | Patrick Cavan Brown for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cWhat gives that frigging draft dodger the right to criticize?\u201d Wharton said. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a white man. But you know what? Too many of us are scared of minorities taking over this country.\u201d\n\nThat probably explains the Trump surge in the Midwest better than any economic analysis. After all, the double-digit unemployment of the Great Recession was already a distant memory in 2016. Yes, the median wage in Ohio had been flat for nearly four decades, but the median wage for black workers had declined 25 percent, and they didn\u2019t flock to Trump. In any case, Democrats don\u2019t need every Trump voter here to renounce him in 2018; they just need some of them to vote for Democrats or stay home. Republicans, meanwhile, are trying to hold together the uneasy Trump coalition, which will be a significantly harder task if voters decide that the issues matter more than the circus in Washington.\n\n\n\n***\n\nI recently visited Youngstown, a city of abandoned steel mills often featured in investigations of the white working-class Trumpquake, to watch Mike DeWine promote his Ohio Prosperity Plan at a manufacturing firm called Taylor Winfield Technologies. The Republican candidate for governor was supposed to be meeting with local employers, not employees, so I was confused when a company representative announced he would talk to the media in front of a welder.\n\nA Snapshot of Middle America Once home to bustling factories and thriving industrial economies, a decade after the nation\u2019s recession, life carries on in the heartland of northeastern Ohio. Click here.\n\nThe welder turned out to be a \u201ccoil-joining welder,\u201d an orange 58-ton piece of custom equipment the size of a locomotive. It was one of the machines that Taylor Winfield produces to help steelmakers replace human welders.\n\nTrump has made some outlandish promises to workers on his visits to Youngstown, pledging to bring back every one of the tens of thousands of steel jobs the area has lost, but his pitch has been unmistakably aimed toward workers, evoking the bygone days when a kid out of high school could get a job at a factory and spend a lifetime in the middle class. DeWine\u2019s event felt like a throwback to the pre-Trump Republican Party that often aimed its message toward business owners, who tend to be more supportive of conservative economics, but less numerous than their employees. DeWine spent an hour listening to manufacturers complain how hard it is to find capable drug-free workers, and how the U.S. educational system is overly focused on steering children toward college rather than vocational training. An official from the local chamber of commerce, which offers free workplace drug-testing to its members, told DeWine, \u201cWe\u2019d like to see drug testing in the schools at a much earlier age.\u201d Skilled workers were mostly discussed as if they were a scarce raw material in the manufacturing process, too often adulterated by opioids. There was no mention of wages, pensions or health benefits for their families until the end, when one executive told DeWine that low taxes \u201chave a huge impact on how much we can pay our people.\u201d\n\nDeWine is not a blustery rabble-rouser, or a swaggering celebrity, or anything else that could be considered Trump-like. He\u2019s a conventional Republican, a diminutive, bespectacled, unassuming figure with the aura of a substitute teacher whose students get rowdy when he turns to the blackboard. But he can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump\u2019s base by running away from his party leader. When a local reporter asked him about the president\u2019s dismissive response to the death of John McCain, with whom he served in the U.S. Senate before losing to Brown in 2006, he dodged the question and said he\u2019d rather discuss his prosperity plan. I asked whether he felt awkward running as a Republican in the Trump era; he said he\u2019s just focused on Ohio, and happy that Kasich and Trump can both agree he should be governor. DeWine also went out of his way to praise the president and Republican Congress for passing a huge tax cut for businesses, vowing to enact similar policies in Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to double down on what the federal government did,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump's name and campaign slogan are painted on the side of an Ohio barn. | Patrick Cavan Brown for Politico Magazine\n\nThe next day, I watched Cordray address a food workers union in Columbus with a very different message: He\u2019ll side with working people, labor unions and the middle class, while DeWine will side with the big oil companies, drug companies and chemical companies that fund his campaigns. The proof, Cordray said, was in their records; he recovered $2 billion for Ohio from financial behemoths like AIG and Fannie Mae as attorney general, then returned $12 billion from Wall Street scofflaws to swindled Americans at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. By contrast, DeWine sued to repeal Obamacare and its protections for pre-existing conditions on his first day of work in 2011. Cordray didn\u2019t dwell on Trump, but he did note that corruption probes are heating up in Washington as well as Columbus, and that \u201ca certain non-Ohioan\u201d has attacked his work for consumers.\n\n\u201cHe thought it was terrible that I had worked so hard to get all that money back from businesses,\u201d Cordray said. \u201cI wear that criticism as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nCordray is not burdened by surplus charisma, either. He\u2019s a nerdy former Supreme Court clerk and \"Jeopardy!\" champion who has embraced his reputation as a doppelganger for 30 Rock\u2019s earnest Kenneth the Page. He tweets Ohio trivia and quirky musings about everything from odd fungus in his backyard to the aesthetically pleasing shape of the state. He\u2019s not a natural politician, and when I followed him on the campaign trail, he was clearly happier zipping down the fun slide at a county fair and wolfing down dough balls called loukoumadesat at a Greek festival than mingling awkwardly with strangers. But while he doesn\u2019t project lunch-bucket comfort at union halls, like Brown or his own running mate, former Congresswoman Betty Sutton, he\u2019s running as a worker\u2019s candidate, and the money he\u2019s clawed back from Wall Street cheaters gives him populist credibility. Several Ohio union leaders told me Democrats are running their most authentically pro-labor slate ever, ideal for attracting crossover votes from blue-collar Trump backers.\n\n\u201cRich looks like a banker, and if you want a motivational speech, he\u2019s not your guy,\u201d says state AFL-CIO President Tim Burga. \u201cBut people can tell he\u2019s the real deal on our issues. And when people focus on our issues, we get to the right place.\u201d\n\nSome Ohio Democrats believe Trump could have expanded his blue-collar inroads in 2018 if he had kept his promises to launch a huge infrastructure program, lower the cost of prescription drugs, and vigorously attack the opioid crisis. He has done none of those things. Still, he has impressed some working-class voters by shaking up U.S. trade policies and picking fights with China, something Democratic and Republican presidents have been reluctant to do. His haphazard attacks on close allies like Canada have not yet produced much in the way of tangible results and there\u2019s certainly no sign of a manufacturing renaissance in Ohio, but even some of his harshest Democratic critics admit that some voters give him credit for trying. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing, but at least he did something,\u201d says Rep. Tim Ryan, a Youngstown-area Democrat who has been floated as a potential Trump challenger in 2020. But Brown and other Democrats have pointed out that the Republican tax bill actually included incentives for manufacturers to move jobs abroad, slicing their tax rates in half. And sure enough, General Motors recently announced a Chevrolet Blazer plant in Mexico on the same day it laid off hundreds of workers at its Chevrolet Cruze plant in Lordstown.\n\nTop: Two retirees talk at a Teamsters meeting in a Knights of Columbus hall.

Now he\u2019s just like, hey, fake news!\u201d\n\nTrump campaigned as an unorthodox populist, but he and his Republican allies in Congress have mostly governed as standard corporatists, almost always siding with businesses over workers and consumers. They\u2019ve relaxed regulations designed to prevent for-profit schools, financial advisers and predatory lenders from exploiting customers. They\u2019ve saved corporations and pass-through firms $3.7 trillion on their taxes, and enacted additional breaks for heirs of billionaires and executives who buy jets. They\u2019ve also made it easier for internet providers to sell customer data, oil conglomerates to conceal foreign bribes and mining companies to bury streams. It\u2019s all consistent with conservative beliefs in limited government and supply-side economics, but very few of the details are populist or popular.\n\nDemocrats believe the Republican push to scrap Obamacare\u2014especially its ban on discrimination against Americans with pre-existing conditions and its expansion of Medicaid for struggling workers\u2014is their most politically explosive issue. Health care was the top priority of voters in the POLITICO/AARP poll, with 78 percent calling it \u201cvery important\u201d to their vote, and only 39 percent approving of the way Trump has handled it.\n\nBetsy Rader, a former Cleveland Clinic attorney who helped implement the Affordable Care Act in the Obama administration, decided to challenge Rep. David Joyce in a northeast Ohio district after he voted 31 times for repeal. Since then, Joyce has voted no on repeal once House GOP leaders had the votes to pass it without him, scrubbed a boast that he had \u201cfought to repeal and defund Obamacare every chance he\u2019s had\u201d from his website, and even highlighted his no vote in an ad distancing himself from Trump. In a district the president won by 11 points, Rader sees Joyce\u2019s moderation as a clear sign of a new climate; the statewide equivalent is DeWine\u2019s recent assurances that he plans to leave Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion in place even though his own anti-Obamacare lawsuits would have scuttled it.\n\n\u201cSome Republicans are trying to tap dance back to the center,\u201d Rader says. \u201cBut sorry, you don\u2019t get to run on saving health care. People see what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nTop: A woman walks her dog at a classic car fair. Bottom: A man inspects a line of tractors at the Canfield County Fair. | Patrick Cavan Brown for Politico Magazine\n\nThis has become an article of faith for many Democrats, that voters will see what\u2019s really going on\u2014that auto plants and steel mills and coal plants aren\u2019t roaring back to life, North Korea isn\u2019t dismantling its nukes, health premiums and drug prices are still rising, and Republicans intend to get rid of Obamacare, Wall Street regulations and the Russia investigation if they hold onto Congress. \u201cPeople will only ignore the evidence of their own eyes for so long,\u201d Rader says.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s what Hillary Clinton thought when she held a triumphant rally with Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z in Cleveland a few days before the 2016 election. But Trump\u2019s promises to Make America Great Again resonated here with voters who didn\u2019t know Jay-Z from tai chi, voters who wanted a change from politics as usual. And whatever one thinks of Trump\u2019s chaotic reality show, they did get change.\n\n\n\n***\n\nTrump famously declared that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d But among the covered bridges, farm fields and plastics factories of Ashtabula County, a historically Democratic territory that Obama won twice before Trump cruised by 19 points, victory feels elusive. Trump\u2019s tariffs have not yet provided any noticeable adrenaline for the area\u2019s dwindling manufacturing base, while Chinese retaliation has already depressed soybean prices about 20 percent. So Jim Renacci, the Republican businessman-turned-congressman who is running against Brown, recently came to a soybean farm here in the rural town of Orwell to meet with the local agricultural community. His first request to the few dozen farmers who came to see him was for a show of hands: \u201cAnyone here who doesn\u2019t like the tariffs?\u201d\n\nNo hands were raised.\n\n\u201cI may lose my farm over this, but I trust the president,\u201d said Tom Yuhasz, a 62-year-old Republican with 5,000 acres of corn and soybeans. \u201cHe\u2019s got a strategy. He was willing to sacrifice to run for office, and we\u2019re willing to sacrifice, too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper left: The General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, is home to the Chevy Cruze.

He initially ran for governor, bashing DeWine as a \u201cColumbus fat cat,\u201d before the White House recruited him to seek Brown\u2019s seat instead. I asked him how he was navigating the rift in the party, and he suggested that the president is the Republican quarterback, and Kasich ought to be helping the team: \u201cSometimes, you can throw a block, you know?\u201d Renacci emphasizes that he grew up in a working-class family in western Pennsylvania, worked as a truck driver and a mechanic to get through college, then became a serial entrepreneur who ran nursing homes and auto dealerships. But while one aide described him as a cross between Joe Biden and Mitt Romney, and he actually looks like a cross between Joe Biden and Mitt Romney, his political instincts are quite conventionally conservative. And he\u2019s especially thrilled with Trump\u2019s conventional conservative agenda on taxes, regulations and judges.\n\n\u201cSome people might not like this president, but you\u2019ve got to love his policies,\u201d Renacci told the farmers.\n\nThere was definitely a lot of love in this barn, where a Trump 2020 banner (Keep America Great) rippled in the rafters. But Renacci wouldn\u2019t be lagging so much behind Brown if the broader public felt the same way. And even with this committed Republican crowd, Renacci\u2019s philosophical pitch for limited government fell a bit flat with voters who are more interested in limiting government for other people. When a GOP county commissioner asked Renacci how he plans to support programs for recovering addicts like her son, he responded with a principled but tone-deaf riff about how the real epidemic is government spending. \u201cFor everyone who says we need money for opioids, someone else wants money for cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much money!\u201d One farmer asked why we couldn\u2019t just fund treatment by getting rid of foreign aid, so he explained, accurately if not expediently, that the vast majority of federal outlays go to defense and entitlements, so wiping out modest discretionary items like foreign aid wouldn\u2019t address the problem in any meaningful way. \u201cI know people will say: \u2018See, he wants to cut Medicare and Social Security,\u2019\u201d said Renacci, who does in fact support means-testing those programs and perhaps raising the retirement age. \u201cI just want them to be sustainable.\u201d\n\nTrump has resisted Republican calls to reform entitlements for the elderly, although he did push deep cuts to Medicaid and disability insurance for the poor. The other domestic policy area where he\u2019s rejected unpopular GOP orthodoxies is trade, which has created quandaries for market-oriented Republicans like Renacci. He\u2019s voted for free-trade deals in the past, but he\u2019s now backing Trump\u2019s manufacturing tariffs and echoing Trump\u2019s rhetoric about fairer trade. His problem is that Brown, author of a book called The Myths of Free Trade, is already the Senate\u2019s most outspoken advocate of fairer trade. After the General Motors layoffs at Lordstown, Brown quickly proposed legislation to replace the Republican tax breaks for corporate outsourcers with a $3,500 tax credit for American-made cars. And while he\u2019s opposed almost everything else the Trump administration has done, Brown has worked closely on tariff issues with Trump\u2019s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who is himself a native of Ashtabula County. If Renacci somehow beats Brown, it won\u2019t be by outflanking him on protectionist populism.\n\nTop: A man with a t-shirt reading \"don't be a snowflake\" stands outside the Republican Party's tent at the Canfield County Fair. Bottom: Inside, the party tells Trump 2020 paraphernalia. | Patrick Cavan Brown for Politico Magazine\n\nTrump won 17 of the Ohio counties that Brown won in his last campaign, which Renacci\u2019s team cites as evidence of Brown\u2019s vulnerability to a Trump-backed challenge. But Brown\u2019s team cites that same statistic as evidence of his appeal to Trump voters. Rich Rankin, the top United Auto Workers official in Ohio, told me he recently saw 15 high school friends for their fantasy football draft, and while 11 of them supported Trump, all 15 support Brown. They know Brown as the rumpled guy who drives a Jeep Cherokee made in Toledo, buys ill-fitting suits made a few miles from his home outside Cleveland, and talks incessantly about respecting the dignity of work, whether it\u2019s in a diner or a factory or a pharmacy. Even GOP operatives in Ohio privately acknowledge that Brown has built a solid brand as a fighter for the ordinary workers, and he believes that in the Trump era, it\u2019s becoming increasingly obvious that the Republican Party fights for their bosses.\n\n\u201cIf you take out trade, it\u2019s a typical far-right corporate agenda\u2014for privatizing prisons and schools, against protecting your pension and insurance,\u201d Brown told me. \u201cWhen people pay attention to that agenda, they don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nButch Lewis had 32 knee operations after he was wounded in Vietnam. He still managed to drive a truck for 40 years, and he survived cancer and mini-strokes to make it to retirement. \u201cHe loved being retired,\u201d recalled his widow, Rita, who still works for a police department outside Cincinnati. \u201cHe treated me like a queen. He had worked so hard so we could enjoy those years.\u201d Then one day, Lewis got a letter from the Central States Pension Fund, informing him that his $3,800-a-month pension would be cut in half. \u201cThe color drained from his face,\u201d Rita told me through tears. \u201cSix weeks later, he was dead. The stress over his pension killed him.\u201d\n\nThe Central States multi-employer fund is expected to run out of cash in 2025, crippled by a combination of corporate greed, bad planning and way too many retirees relative to active Teamsters. A similar fund for mineworkers could go belly up by 2022. This is why Brown wrote the Butch Lewis Act, which would create a loan program to prop up the pension funds, so that workers who contributed for decades, often sacrificing short-term raises for long-term security, will get the payouts they were promised. Brown says he\u2019s perfectly willing to compromise on the details of the plan, as long as the problem gets fixed and the retirees are made whole. But Republicans have been resistant. At Renacci\u2019s event at the soybean farm, he asked Joyce to make a few remarks, and even though the issue hadn\u2019t come up, the first thing Joyce said was that he couldn\u2019t believe Teamsters were asking Washington to bail out their pensions. \u201cThere\u2019s no money!\u201d he said.\n\nTop: At a roadside farmer's market, a couple of Cleveland Indians fans sell $2 hotdogs and $1 soda.

We\u2019re asking for what was promised!\u201d she told me. \u201cThe Republicans keep telling us, oh, we have to think about the taxpayers. We\u2019re taxpayers! If we didn\u2019t have Sherrod working for us, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do.\u201d\n\nThe issue of collapsing multi-employer pension funds barely affects 1 percent of American households. But as Democrats try to rebuild their brand\u2014especially in industrial states where unions are still angry at Bill Clinton and Obama for pushing free-trade deals\u2014it\u2019s the kind of issue that can bolster the party\u2019s credibility for defending working people. David Betras, the party chairman in the Youngstown area, wrote a memo to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in May 2016, warning Trump could beat her in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania if she didn\u2019t show more respect for Americans who \u201crun backhoes, dig ditches, and sling concrete block,\u201d suggesting she run ads about the pension issue to show she cared about blue-collar workers. \u201cThey ignored me, and somehow, our voters went for the guy who shits on a gold-plated toilet,\u201d Betras said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re thirsty, you\u2019ll drink dirty water.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s older white working-class voters, particularly the ones angry about illegal immigrants and kneeling athletes, may be lost to the Democrats. But for all the attention they get, older white working-class voters are not the majority of the electorate. Only 12 percent of Ohio\u2019s jobs are in manufacturing. Only 12 percent of its workers are unionized. The white share of the electorate is still 82 percent but falling. The state is changing; the mayor of Cuyahoga Falls told me he\u2019s trying to revitalize his aging bedroom community to attract millennials who like avocado toast and craft beer. I watched Cordray speak at a gathering of some of the 45,000 Somali-Americans in the Columbus area, and get choked up telling the story of how a popular high school junior named Hamze Achmed befriended his clueless freshman son after they met in a history class. \u201cNot everyone has such a welcoming an attitude,\u201d Cordray said. \u201cDid you see the ads attacking immigrants in the Republican primary? The idea that we categorize each other and shift blame on each other is so peculiarly un-American.\u201d Incidentally, Achmed is now a senior at Ohio State, studying public policy with a focus on civic engagement, and he told me after the event that President Trump has done wonders to get his community excited about the midterms: \u201cCome on, we\u2019re black, we\u2019re Muslims, and we\u2019re immigrants; there\u2019s no question we\u2019re going to turn out.\u201d\n\nDemocrats will need a dramatic improvement on their 2016 numbers to flip Ohio in November, and votes from newly registered Somalis will count just as much as votes from retired Teamsters angry about their pensions. Still, labor provides the party\u2019s organizational muscle, and Democrats can\u2019t win here unless union members come home. They already love Sherrod Brown, and at a Labor Day rally in Lorain, he stood in a denim shirt in front of Cordray and a slew of other Democratic candidates, trying to reassure the workers he fights for that his party will fight for them, too, urging them to focus on the issues and ignore the noise out of Washington.\n\n\u201cHealth care is on the ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cEnvironmental policy is on the ballot. Labor rights are on the ballot. Progressive government brought you Medicare, Social Security and safe drinking water\u2014and the Democrats behind me understand that.\u201d\n\nPatrick Cavan Brown for Politico Magazine\n\nBrown is 65 years old, and he warned the crowd that three of four voters his age usually turn out in midterms, versus only one in five voters under 30. If Democrats can change that in November, he said, Democrats will win. The crowd went wild, and it sounded like he was done, but he had one more thing to say. He hadn\u2019t mentioned Trump in his remarks\u2014except to observe that he had just heard two presidents speak eloquently about statesmanship at McCain\u2019s funeral, while \u201cone president obviously wasn\u2019t there\u201d\u2014but in politics these days, it always feels like the president is there. Maybe 2018 will be more about pocketbook issues than the elephant in the room, but 2020 will be about Trump. And while Brown has said he won\u2019t run that race, it\u2019s still on his mind.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s next? The presidential race!\u201d he roared. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re going to take this country in a whole new direction!\u201d\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:46.403763"}, {"id": "3eaeebb3d94e9140e7869ca3981ac8968e6961df", "name": "Hurricane cleanup: How to stay safe when returning home", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/health/hurricane-aftermath-health-risks/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "Hurricane Florence has come and gone but the risks from power outages, damaged homes and flooding are still very present for some areas.

A huge amount of capital gets tied up in a handful of properties. And you have to deal with the logistics of holding and managing that home, office or condo.\n\nInvesting in real estate is a great way to diversify a portfolio says Jeff Rose, a certified financial planner based in Nashville.\n\n\"But you'll only want to have 5% of your portfolio in real estate,\" he says. \"Up to 10%, that would be on the higher side.\"\n\nInvesting in real estate equity through ETFs, mutual funds or real estate investment funds provides exposure to the upside of real estate appreciation.\n\nBut that kind of volatility isn't a good fit for everyone. Another option is investing in real estate risk, which comes with more fixed returns.\n\nReal estate equity\n\nReal estate investment trusts, or REITs, are a common way to diversify into real estate equity. REITs are publicly-traded companies that own income-producing properties \u2014 office buildings, hotels, apartment complexes, shopping malls \u2014 that give people the chance to invest in the real estate portfolios.\n\nREITs are a way to hold a variety of real estate properties as easily as buying a stock, and provide dividend-based income. But they come with a higher level of risk than say, an index fund.\n\n\"Any time you're looking at a publicly traded REIT, which is basically a stock, there is more risk,\" says Rose. \"They focus on one area. It may be one type of real estate or it could be one geographic area, and if that sector or area takes a hit, you feel it.\"\n\nRose suggests taking advantage of the upside of REITs by investing in them through ETFs or mutual funds to further diversify your exposure.\n\n\"The simplest way to invest in real estate is through a mutual fund or an ETF,\" says Rose.\n\nA real estate ETF, like Vanguard's VNQ, offers investors publicly traded equity REITS and other real estate investments. Similarly, iShares' IYR offers domestic real estate stocks and REITs.\n\nMutual funds are another way to diversify a long term investment strategy with real estate. The T. Rowe Price Real Estate Fund (TRREX), with $5.3 billion in assets, is a giant among actively managed real estate mutual funds.\n\nNewer online platforms, like Fundrise, Rich Uncles or Realty Mogul allow investors to get into diversified real estate portfolios for a lot less than the large funds.\n\nRich Uncles allows you to invest in its own REITs for as little as $500, or its new student housing REIT, for example, with a $5 minimum investment. At Fundrise, another platform with its own REITs, the minimum investment is $500.\n\nRealty Mogul offers access to private investment deals or you can invest in its REITs, which have a minimum investment of $1,000.\n\nWhile these can provide solid investment returns and dividends, they're illiquid and investors should not expect to sell quickly. But online platforms can provide greater visibility into what you're purchasing.\n\n\"I enjoy investing in the online platforms because I can see the properties that I am investing in,\" says Rose. \"Typically if you're buying an ETF or mutual fund or REIT it can be harder to see what you're buying.\"\n\nAnd no matter how you're investing, he says, \"you have to know what kind of real estate you're investing in.\"\n\nReal estate debt\n\nAnother way to earn steady passive income through real estate is to invest in someone's mortgage. Using a platform called PeerStreet, investors can back high-interest loans that offer regular fixed-income payouts.\n\n\"A lot of people want exposure to real estate without that equity-style risk,\" says Brett Crosby, co-founder and chief operating officer of PeerStreet. \"We made it accessible and some people are much more comfortable with this level of risk.\"\n\nHere's how it works: PeerStreet buys first-lien mortgages from a network of private lenders. Investors can search the site for investments and select investments based on criteria like term, yield and the loan-to-value ratio of the home. The options are updated daily.\n\nAlternatively you can choose automated investing by pre-selecting details that place you in investments matching your criteria. Investments carry returns ranging from 6% to 9% and the typical deal on the site is between 6 to 36 months.\n\nOther platforms for investing in real estate debt, like AlphaFlow, offer a portfolio of real estate loans rather than investments in individual loans.\n\nWhile investments backed by mortgages are nothing new, it was previously very difficult for individuals to invest. \"If it does go bad, you need a team in place, if you have to foreclose,\" says Crosby. \"We handle all that. We have taken an active investment and made it passive.\"\n\nWhile the company is working to expand its offerings to all investors, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations currently limit investments with PeerStreet to accredited investors. For an individual to qualify as an accredited investor you need to earn an annual income over $200,000 ($300,000 annually with a spouse) for the past two years, with a reasonable expectation of the same level of income going forward. Also, an individual with a net worth exceeding $1 million, excluding the value of a primary residence, qualifies.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:48.064036"}, {"id": "c124e1300903006f29c26624bf9acdc289ce629b", "name": "Trump says Kavanaugh 'anxious' to testify", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/09/18/trump-says-kavanaugh-'anxious'-testify/37854323/", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "President Donald Trump says it's \"terrible\" that Democratic Sen.

As local sake brewers can attest, the path has been far cloudier for those trying to bring the traditional Japanese spirit to the masses.\n\nThanks to a law passed by the Colorado General Assembly this spring, the road map gets much clearer Wednesday. Sake, a rice-based beverage brewed like beer but noncarbonated and higher in alcohol like wine, has been added to the state liquor code as a \u201cvinous liquor.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of Aug. 8, sake will be regulated like a wine in the state of Colorado,\u201d state department of revenue spokesman Lawrence Pacheco said. \u201cThat means that residents will be able to buy sake in winery sales rooms.\u201d\n\nIf things go according to plan, Colorado Sake Co. will open the state\u2019s first sake tasting room in Denver\u2019s RiNo district in September. The business, a self-financed operation based in a 1,000-square-foot brew space behind Wine & Whey at 3559 Larimer St., was a major driver behind the law change. Now, it hopes to be at the forefront of a sake wave.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always loved sake and we wondered why don\u2019t more people drink sake,\u201d Heather Dennis, one of the company\u2019s co-owners said last week as she and her partners worked to stockpile inventory in advance of the new sales rules. \u201cWe realized it was an issue with access or lack of access. That\u2019s why we want the tasting room. To introduce and educate people.\u201d\n\nColorado Sake Co.\u2019s origins date back to 2016. That\u2019s when co-founder William Stuart went to an event where he tasted sake made by Denver-based brewer Gaijin 24886.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I can do that,\u2019 \u201d Stuart recalled. He went home, found a recipe online and kicked his roommates out of the fridge so he could ferment his creation at the requisite 50 degrees.\n\nSake has four ingredients: rice, water, yeast and koji, an Asian culinary ingredient made of steamed rice that has sprouted mold spores. Unlike beer, where yeast is added to malted grain after it cooks to produce alcohol, all the ingredients in sake brew simultaneously in a process called multiple parallel fermentation.\n\nStuart said it took him a year to master making koji. From there, he experimented until developing a sake recipe he was pleased with. In May 2017, he and his partners went to the state to get a limited winery license. They were rejected.\n\n\u201cWe were told, \u2018You\u2019re manufacturing beer and you\u2019re selling wine,'\u201d Stuart said.\n\nBecause of narrow definitions in the state liquor code, a rule change was needed to include and regulate sake. While it is well-known to consumers \u2014 often served hot, or in the form of a shot dropped into a beer, much to the chagrin of its advocates and aficionados \u2014 it is only produced by about 20 brewers in the Unites States today, according advocacy group the Sake Education Council.\n\nAfter being denied a license, the Colorado Sake Co. team embarked on a journey through the state lawmaking process that included talking to legislators, dealing with lobbyists and fielding questions from wineries and big-time beer makers, Stuart said. Finally, with the help of primary sponsors state Sen. Lucia Guzman, D-Denver, and Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, the change was signed into law on April 11.\n\n\u201cEver since the days of Hakushika Sake in Golden, sake has kind of occupied this sort of gray area in the liquor code,\u201d said Doug Caskey, executive director of the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board, an offshoot of the state department of agriculture dedicated to marketing local wine, cider, mead and, now, sake. \u201cIt was really great we got this law changed.\u201d\n\nHakushika Sake USA Corp., a private Japanese company, shut down in 2001, state records show.\n\nGaijin 24886 lost its space because of the new law, founder and brewer Marc Hughes said. The facility was licensed for beer production, not wine. But Gaijin is focused on the positives. It is working on finding a new location with aims to open a tasting room by next summer. In the meantime, a few varieties of Gaijin can be purchased at Divino Wine & Spirits at 1240 S. Broadway.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest in experimentation with different things in town,\u201d Hughes said of sake\u2019s prospects in a crowded Denver liquor market. \u201cIt\u2019s just about finding the right way to capture it.\u201d\n\nColorado Sake Co. isn\u2019t being distributed in liquor stores at the moment, but its flagship varieties, American Standard and the cinnamon and vanilla flavored Horchata Nigori, are on tap at Mizu Izakaya in Highland. The restaurant, at 1560 Boulder St., carries at least 50 sakes per season. Colorado Sake Co. is the only American brand it stocks.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s just incredible that we are going to have the opportunity to get sake into more and more consumers\u2019 hands,\u201d Mizu beverage director Jerrica Ash said. \u201cMy goal is to make sake a spirit that in every restaurant not just in Asian restaurants.\u201d", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:50.153990"}, {"id": "cbd3764dc6540edc0e9fdbaccfe1f7b3eb1a4b2d", "name": "24 \"Overheard\" Tweets That Will Make You Laugh And Then Question Everything You Know", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamedjackson/twitter-overheard-tweets", "timestamp": "", "description": "Sometimes it pays to be nosey.", "keywords": ["olive", "gentleman", "24", "cry", "stall", "tweets", "hate", "overheard", "god", "whisper", "start", "question", "know", "laugh", "garden"], "summary": "just overheard the gentleman in the next stall whisper \"get out of me\" and then start to cry.\ngod i hate the olive garden.", "content": "just overheard the gentleman in the next stall whisper \"get out of me\" and then start to cry. god i hate the olive garden.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:50.566889"}, {"id": "5a68331441550a3b8a1a8cdac737bd8ff9a50169", "name": "13 Useful Products That'll Help You Deal With Your Noisy Neighbors", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/elenamgarcia/13-products-you-need-if-you-have-incredibly-noisy-neighbors", "timestamp": "", "description": "\"Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" \u2014 you to your neighbors, who can't hear you anyway because they're too damn loud!", "keywords": ["useful", "deal", "neighbors", "help", "sounds", "night", "volume", "waking", "rain", "wants", "rude", "white", "13", "products", "thatll", "cover", "helps", "noisy"], "summary": "Choose from six relaxing digitally recorded sounds: white noise, thunder, ocean, rain, summer night, and brook.\nPromising review: \"Much cheaper and more versatile than those other sound machines.\nI don't use it on a high enough volume to actually cover the sounds of said rude neighbor, but at a medium volume, it's enough to allow me to sleep through the neighborhood sounds.\nIt also helps cover the sounds of late-night fireworks and bass on any random night of the year people seem to think is a night for boisterous celebration.\nMy partner was initially skeptical, but now he likes it as much as I do.", "content": "Choose from six relaxing digitally recorded sounds: white noise, thunder, ocean, rain, summer night, and brook.\n\nPromising review: \"Much cheaper and more versatile than those other sound machines.

Earlier this month, in documents arguing Butina should be held in detention because she is a flight risk, prosecutors revealed that Butina has gotten quite a bit of attention from top Russian officials.\n\nAccording to the prosecution\u2019s filing, the Russian government has conducted six consular visits to Butina and passed four diplomatic notes to the U.S. Department of State about her case. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has spoken twice to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to complain about Butina\u2019s incarceration and prosecution. As prosecutors noted, in the days following Butina\u2019s arrest, the official Kremlin Twitter account changed its avatar to a picture of her and launched #FreeMariaButina. RT\u2014a Russian news outlet funded by the Russian government\u2014has written a number of articles about her, decrying her prosecution and detention. According to prosecutors, \u201cRussia has issued more diplomatic notes on the defendant\u2019s behalf in the past month than for any other Russian citizen imprisoned in the United States in the past year. Put simply, the Russian government has given this case much more attention than other cases.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs a former intelligence officer, I found these details intriguing. It seems likely that Russian officials visiting Butina in prison are looking to protect more than just the rights of a Russian citizen. They are looking to protect their ongoing intelligence operations. To that larger end, they likely have several goals in mind:\n\n1. To assess the damage\n\nRussian officials are likely assessing the damage from Butina\u2019s discovery and arrest. They want to know what exactly the U.S. intelligence community knows about Butina\u2019s activities and contacts, and what, if anything, Butina told them. This information will allow Russian intelligence to gauge if any other assets or operations might be compromised.\n\nThey can glean some of this from the prosecution\u2019s court documents. For example, prosecutors detailed some of Butina\u2019s correspondence, which read like operational cables. In one, she discusses establishing an \u201ceven more trusting relationship\u201d with a U.S. person (who remains unnamed in the filings), which is language straight out of any intelligence service\u2019s training manual on developing a source.\n\nAdditionally, Butina and her American lover and possible co-conspirator, Republican operative Paul Erickson\u2014who is referred to in court filings only as US Person 1\u2014and Alexander Torshin\u2014a high-level Russian official referred to as \u201cthe Russian Official\u201d\u2014left quite a data trail, like emails, Twitter Direct Messages, and thumb drives. U.S. investigators now have that information, including phone numbers associated with the FSB\u2014one of Russia\u2019s intelligence services\u2014and names and contact information for Russian officials with whom Butina communicated.\n\nBut beyond that, Russian officials likely want to know: Has Butina talked? Is she telling U.S. investigators more than what they already know? Or even confirming information they already have? Although Butina certainly does not have a big picture view of Russian intelligence operations in the United States, she may inadvertently give away details that seem innocuous to her but actually fill in pieces for investigators. Put simply, Russian officials want to know: Has she given anything away?\n\n2. To reassure Butina\n\nRussian officials also likely want to reassure Butina in order to keep her quiet. In convincing her they are doing everything in their power to get her out and get her home to Russia, they are attempting to stop her from sharing more information than perhaps she already has.\n\nProsecutors noted, after all, that Butina offered information on Erickson\u2019s illegal activities, despite the defense counsel\u2019s insistence that Butina and Erickson are in a committed relationship. Russian officials would want to make sure she doesn\u2019t give away any information that might compromise Russian intelligence activities. They might even be coaching her on what to say.\n\n3. To send a signal to other assets\n\nFurthermore, top level and frequent attention to Butina might be a signal to reassure other Russian assets. It is the kiss of death for any intelligence service to leave an asset to perish. The message it would send to both potential and current assets would be fatal. Why would anyone risk working for an intelligence service that doesn\u2019t protect its assets? Russia must signal its intent to help Butina, or risk losing other sources.\n\nIndeed, it is a wonder that the Russian government allowed Butina to be arrested at all. She, Erickson, and Torshin had ample evidence the noose was tightening long before her arrest. According to court documents, in early 2017, they discussed the fact that a reporter had begun asking questions about them. Butina told Torshin, \u201cSomebody really threw the three of us under the bus. Furthermore, this someone is well informed.\u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the Russians whisk her home at that point?\n\nIt is possible that pulling Butina out too soon would have set off alarm bells and alerted U.S. authorities that Russian officials were nervous, which in turn would have signaled that Butina was involved in an important operation. Maybe the Russians thought they could lie low and it would pass. Or maybe allowing her to get caught had few consequences, and perhaps even helped the larger Russian objective of causing disruption in American politics. Or maybe this was intentional: Allowing Butina to be arrested has diverted attention from other operations.\n\nAnother explanation\u2014and these are not mutually exclusive\u2014might be Russia\u2019s warped view of U.S. democracy and the power of the president. Having never spent time in a functioning democracy, Vladimir Putin cannot fathom that a president does not have absolute power. It might have never crossed his mind that those pesky checks and balances, such as law enforcement, are not just decoration, as they are for him at home. Perhaps he thought Butina would be safe.\n\nAlex Finley is the pen name of a former CIA officer and author of Victor in the Rubble, a satire of the CIA and the war on terror.

The average American's 401(k) balance just reached $104,300, while the average IRA balance hit $106,000, according to Fidelity. But while these numbers actually represent an all-time high, they're not all that substantial in the grand scheme of what most folks need for retirement.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind about these figures is that they're not broken down by age. Rather, they represent averages across all workers, including those who are more advanced in their careers. But even workers in their mid-to-late 30s and 40s should be aiming higher than just over $100,000. If your savings could use a boost, here are a few ways to make that happen in time for retirement.\n\n1. Create a budget\n\nWhat does following a budget have to do with retirement savings? Everything. Without a budget, you won't have an accurate means of tracking your spending and identifying ways to save money. And if you can't manage to save money, you can't add funds to your IRA or 401(k), thus growing your nest egg.\n\nIf you've yet to use a budget, here's some good news: Creating one is easy. Simply list your monthly expenses, factor in sporadic expenses, like that insurance renewal that comes due once a year, and see how much of your income those totals eat up. Then, go through your expenses line by line, figure out which ones will be easiest to cut, and start slashing.\n\n2. Cut corners and bank the difference\n\nIf you're currently spending $500 a month on restaurant meals, that's a pretty obvious cost to cut. But reducing expenses is much more difficult if you're already living a relatively frugal lifestyle. Still, you'd be surprised at how much wiggle room you actually have in your budget if you're willing to make some sacrifices.\n\nFor example, you can't just call up your landlord and tell him you'll be paying $800 a month for your apartment when your current rent is $1,100. What you can do, however, is move out as soon as your lease expires and find a space that costs $800 a month instead.\n\nAnother option? Cut smaller expenses instead of bigger ones, because they will add up. Slashing one restaurant meal per week plus that gym membership you rarely use could easily free up $150 per month, which you can then put into your retirement account. And while that sort of increase may not seem like a lot, consider this: If you save an extra $150 a month for 30 years, and your investments generate an average annual 7% return during that time, you'll have an additional $170,000 in your retirement plan on top of what you were already saving. Make it $300 a month, and you'll be looking at $340,000 more.\n\n3. Go heavy on stocks\n\nIt's estimated that 60% of workers invest too conservatively for retirement, and as such, limit their savings' growth. A better bet? Fill your portfolio with stocks, especially when you're younger. Doing so will allow you to accumulate wealth more quickly without having to take on unnecessary risk.\n\nThough the stock market is known for its volatility, over time, those who invest in it have a strong tendency to come out ahead. This means that if you have another 30 years in the workforce ahead of you, you can easily put the bulk of your investments into stocks without having to worry each time the market takes a dip along the way.\n\nNow check out the following table, which shows how your nest egg might fare over time based on your investments' performance:\n\nAverage yearly investment return Total after 30 Years* 6% $474,000 7% $567,000 8% $680,000 9% $818,000\n\nAll of these scenarios are plausible with a portfolio that's mostly stocks with a mix of bonds, but guess which figure most closely mimics the stock market's average over the past 50 years? That would be the 9% average annual return, and that's with a major recession thrown into the mix.\n\nEven if you don't have 30 years of work ahead of you \u2014 say you're already in your late 50s or 60s \u2014 you can still feel relatively secure putting most of your money into stocks if you're not planning to retire for about 10 years. And that's a great way to buy yourself more financial security as a senior.\n\nRelated links:\n\n\u2022 Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n\u2022 This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n\u2022 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nRegardless of where you stand on retirement savings, there's no such thing as having too much money during your golden years.

He has since expressed regret, but it's one issue from his decades-long political career that could be raised should he decide to run for president again in 2020\n\n\"We're living in a different time than 27 years ago\" during the Thomas hearings, said Patti Solis Doyle, who served as Biden's campaign chief of staff in 2008, when he was the vice presidential nominee. \"The MeToo movement has impacted all facets of our culture and our society and certainly our government and politics.\"\n\n\"If we did not think that the Clarence Thomas hearings was going to be an issue in 2020, well, I think what is going on with Judge Kavanaugh and Professor Ford, I think it now guarantees that it will become an issue for Vice President Biden should he run in 2020,\" said Solis Doyle, a CNN political commentator.\n\nBiden was asked Monday night by reporters if he believed Hill at the time.\n\n\"Oh, I thought she was telling the truth at the beginning,\" Biden said, according to the Washington Post. \"I really did.\"\n\nHe added, speaking more generally, \"For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it's been made worse or better over time. But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Biden said earlier Monday that the former vice president believes votes on Kavanaugh's nomination should be postponed after California professor Christine Blasey Ford accused the judge of physically and sexually assaulting her at a party during their high school years. Kavanaugh denies the allegation.\n\n\"Vice President Biden believes Professor Ford deserves a fair and respectful hearing of her allegations, and that the committee should undertake a thorough and nonpartisan effort to get to the truth, wherever it leads,\" the spokesperson said. \"He believes the vote should be postponed to allow this to happen appropriately, because this is an appointment for life to the nation's highest court, and getting the decision right is more important than getting it done on a rushed timeline.\"\n\nBiden presided over the confirmation hearings for Thomas in 1991, when Hill alleged that Thomas, her former boss, had sexually harassed her when they worked together at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Thomas denied the allegations and called the line of questioning at the hearing \"high-tech lynching.\"\n\nBiden was criticized for how Hill was treated, as she faced intense and probing questioning about her alleged inappropriate encounters with Thomas. One of the most brutal lines of questioning during the hearing before the panel of 14 white male senators came from the late Sen. Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania.\n\n\"You testified this morning that the most embarrassing question involved --- this is not too bad -- women's large breasts,\" Specter said. \"That is a word we use all the time. That was the most embarrassing aspect of what Judge Thomas had said to you.\"\n\nBiden also questioned Hill on the issue himself, asking, \"Can you tell us how you felt at the time? Were you uncomfortable, were you embarrassed, did it not concern you? How did you feel about it?\"\n\nBiden ultimately voted against Thomas, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court with a narrow vote of 52-48.\n\nAs the #MeToo movement gained steam last year, Biden said he wished he had handled the hearing differently and that he owed Hill an apology\n\n\"I believed Anita Hill,\" Biden told Teen Vogue. \"And my one regret is that I wasn't able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), who are running for reelection and are undecided on Kavanaugh's nomination, have been targeted by a multimillion dollar ad campaign from Republican groups pressuring them to support President Donald Trump's pick to replace retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAll three Democrats voted for Justice Neil Gorsuch last year, and are seen as the likeliest potential Democratic votes for Kavanaugh. But they also face pressure from their Democratic base to oppose Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation given his potential impact on the balance of the court. That pressure has increased in the wake of the accusation from Kavanaugh's high school years. Kavanaugh has denied the incident took place.\n\n\u201cProfessor Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard and Judge Kavanaugh deserves a chance to clear his name,\u201d Manchin said, calling for the process to take place as quickly as possible.\n\nRepublicans have made Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation \u2014 and supporting conservative judges writ large \u2014 a central piece of their effort to hold onto the Senate majority this fall. Several Republicans, including Reps. Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and Kevin Cramer in North Dakota, criticized Democrats for bringing up the allegations, called them politicized, and said Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation should move forward without change.\n\n\u201cIt is hard not to be skeptical considering the timing and history of the allegations,\u201d said Cramer, who is running against Heitkamp, and is viewed by many Republicans as their best opportunity to flip a seat. \u201cOf course any allegation of this nature should be taken seriously, but absent significant evidence being brought forth immediately, I feel Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process should proceed.\u201d\n\nPatrick Morrisey, the West Virginia attorney general challenging Manchin, said Democrats had \u201cdone a disservice\u201d to Kavanaugh, Ford and the public by \u201cpolitically waiting until the 11th hour to bring forward these accusations.\u201d\n\nMissouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who has focused on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation and the Supreme Court in his campaign against Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), also attacked Democrats for surfacing the allegations late in the process of Kavanaugh's confirmation. But Hawley said Ford and Kavanaugh should both testify \u201cimmediately\u201d and said \u201callegations of sexual misconduct should never be disregarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have played politics with this entire process and were opposed to Brett Kavanaugh before he was even nominated,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the truth.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill said she was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the allegations and they should be examined by the Judiciary Committee \u201cwithout any artificial timeline.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans echoed the calls for more information but did not attack their opponents over the allegations.\n\nSen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who had previously said he had \u201cno reservations\u201d about supporting Kavanaugh, called for Ford to share information about her accusation with the Judiciary Committee. His opponent, Rep. Jacky Rosen, criticized him, said if Heller still had no reservations he \u201cisn\u2019t listening to Nevadans.\u201d\n\nGOP Sen. Ted Cruz, who faces a surprisingly tough reelection race against Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas, said, \u201cthese allegations are serious and deserve to be treated with respect.\u201d He called for the hearing to be held sooner rather than later.\n\nRep. Martha McSally, Republicans\u2019 nominee in a battleground race in Arizona, similarly said it was a \u201cserious allegation\u201d and called Kavanaugh and Ford testifying before the Judiciary Committee a \u201csensible way forward.\u201d\n\nThat put McSally on the same page as her opponent, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who called for a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d before voting. McSally has been highly supportive of Kavanaugh to this point, while Sinema has yet to declare whether or not she would support him.\n\nIn Tennessee, a state Trump carried by 26 percentage points in 2016 , most public polling has shown former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen locked in a close race with Blackburn. Bredsen has not yet decided on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, but said in a tweet Monday that it should be delayed until Ford\u2019s account was heard.\n\nBlackburn attacked Bredesen\u2019s position. She said Ford should testify under oath, but also said the Judiciary Committee should proceed with Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation vote this week.\n\n\u201cChuck Schumer is telling the Democrats to delay while they attempt an 11th hour smear of Judge Kavanaugh, and Phil Bredesen is already doing what he's told to do,\u201d Blackburn said.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:55.528971"}, {"id": "a561c82a43aeedbd8d931e06b66c8f36c8763809", "name": "In Florence's wake, uncertainty haunts migrant workers", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-florence-migrants/in-florences-wake-uncertainty-haunts-migrant-workers-idUSKCN1LX2IM?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T23:07:12+00:00", "description": "Francisco Javier Jaramillo and Victor Chavez should be picking sweet potatoes at a North Carolina farm and sending much-needed money to their families in Mexico.", "keywords": ["carolina", "work", "wake", "migrant", "uncertainty", "florence", "storm", "workers", "hurricane", "carolinas", "florences", "haunts", "north", "fields"], "summary": "SPIVEY\u2019S CORNER, N.C.

The state is closed for business.\n\nHere's a look at five of the areas facing significant problems with flooding, storm damage and rising rivers in Florence's wake.\n\nWilmington\n\nHurricane Florence made landfall at Wilmington, North Carolina, making it the epicenter of the destruction. Rainfall totals of 26.58 inches have caused high waters all around the city, effectively cutting it off from the rest of North Carolina.\n\n\"Any direction you try coming into the city, from 20 to 40 miles out, roads are impassable,\" Mayor Bill Saffo said. \"Anyone trying to get in here -- don't try. You will be turned away. Highway Patrol won't let you.\"\n\nThose high waters have kept even Federal Emergency Management Agency crews and Duke Energy trucks away. The US Coast Guard has made dozens of water rescues in the area, and one helicopter alone south of Wilmington saved 26 adults and 11 children, as well as seven dogs and four cats.\n\nWilmington was also the site of the first deaths of the hurricane. High winds knocked over a tree that fell on a home, killing a 41-year-old woman and her 7-month-old son.\n\nFirefighters pray at the home where a woman and her child were killed by a falling tree on Friday.\n\n2018 is already the wettest year in the city's 140 years of record-keeping, even with 3\u00bd months left. It has seen more than 86 inches of rain this year; the average to date is about 43 inches.\n\nLumberton\n\nLumberton Fire and Rescue members help a resident through floodwaters on Monday.\n\nThe Lumber River cuts through the city of Lumberton in North Carolina, which has received 22.76 inches of rain since Thursday.\n\nAs all of the rain in the area entered the river system, the Lumber River reached a startling high of 25 feet on Sunday -- about 12 feet about flood stage. The river is expected to slowly lower over the coming days, though it remains in major flood stage\n\nThe river similarly inundated Lumberton with floodwaters in 2016 during Hurricane Matthew because of a gap in the surrounding levee, which allowed water to flood the southwest part of the city. Residents worked to secure the area, filling the gap with sandbags.\n\nThe makeshift barrier failed Sunday but was still slowing the water, said Corey Walters, deputy director of public works.\n\n\"The waters are not rising anywhere near as fast, at least around the water plant, as they did during Matthew,\" Walters said.\n\nStill, major parts of Lumberton are flooded. Brian Lindsay shot a drone video on Monday of a flooded 3-mile section of I-95.\n\nMyrtle Beach\n\nA car drives though rising floodwaters near the beach as Hurricane Florence makes landfall on Friday in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nThe South Carolina resort town was relatively unscathed by the winds and 15.41 inches of rain from Florence.\n\nHowever, flooding that is expected along the rivers surrounding the city is likely to have a \"truly devastating impact\" on Myrtle Beach's economy, Mayor Brenda Bethune said Friday.\n\n\"What we are the most concerned about is, we have five major rivers that surround us, and we only have one major road into Myrtle Beach, but all of our major roads are going to be affected by this flooding within the next three to seven days,\" she said.\n\n\"And when that flooding gets here, it can last up to 10 to 12 days or longer, from what we are being told.\"\n\nBethune said Sunday that the rivers were expected to crest in two days, with significant flooding.\n\nFayetteville\n\nHelen McKoy walks down a flooded street in her neighborhood in Fayetteville on Sunday.\n\nFayetteville sits along the banks of the Cape Fear River, which is up to 53.95 feet at that location, according to the National Weather Service . The river is still expected to rise over the next day and crest at 61.8 feet.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper accompanied the Coast Guard on a flyover of flooded areas in North Carolina and saw boats washed up in town and significant debris.\n\nFlying over Fayetteville, he said, \"it was stark to see the raging Cape Fear River, and you knew it was rising, and you could see these vulnerable communities.\"\n\nBrad Zerivitz shot a drone video of downtown Fayetteville for the American Red Cross that illustrates the extent of the flooding.\n\nNew Bern\n\nJoseph Eudi surveys flood debris and storm damage from Hurricane Florence at a home in New Bern, North Carolina, on Saturday.\n\nOver 4,300 homes in New Bern, North Carolina, were damaged or destroyed, and over 300 businesses suffered the same fate, according to City Manager Mark Stephens.\n\n\"Our city has suffered one of the worst storms ever in its 308-year history,\" Stephens said Monday.\n\nNew Bern sits along the Neuse River, which combined with heavy rain to create flooding. Although there were no known fatalities from Florence, emergency personnel rescued 800 people from flooded homes during the storm, Stephens said.\n\nResidents and business owners are beginning to return to their homes in New Bern, NC and this is some of what they are coming back to. pic.twitter.com/Wdm36Ag219 \u2014 Omar Jimenez (@OmarJimenezCNN) September 17, 2018\n\nThe wind, rain and flooding also dislodged the city's beloved bear statues.

He chastised Democrats for having \u201ca tendency to bring nail clippers to a gun fight\u201d when they should be fighting \u201cfire with fire.\u201d Avenatti is the lead storm chaser in a little-noticed front in the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign: Who can out-Trump the sitting president by going the furthest to break procedural \u201cnorms\u201d?\n\nEven if Avenatti has little chance of winning the nomination, he could still wreck the 2020 Democratic race. In fact he\u2019s already doing it, by using his considerable media skills and political instincts to frame the contest around how far Democrats should go when wielding power, and to pressure his rivals to follow his cue. If we begin measuring candidates on the basis of who has the weakest attachment to the written and unwritten rules which have stabilized American democracy for centuries, the country will be in serious danger.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe reverberations from Avenatti became apparent during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, as two likely presidential candidates sought to prove their willingness to subvert norms. Sen. Cory Booker boasted about risking expulsion by releasing documents deemed classified by the Republican-led committee, to protest attempts to minimize access to Kavanaugh\u2019s emails from when he worked in the George W. Bush administration. And Sen. Kamala Harris shared on Twitter a truncated video clip of Kavanaugh referring to birth control pills as \u201cabortion-inducing drugs\u201d that left off his attributing of the phrase to anti-abortion Catholic plaintiffs. Then when media fact-checkers called her out, Harris, seemingly following Trump\u2019s \u201cnever apologize\u201d philosophy, refused to admit error or recalibrate her charge.\n\nThe Democratic antics during the Kavanaugh hearings came on the heels of Avenatti issuing an ultimatum on Twitter: \u201cIn light of the [Merrick] Garland seat that was stolen, together with the events of today and the hiding of docs, etc., the court must be expanded to 11 seats after 2020. The Dem nominee must commit to this or not receive the nomination IMO.\u201d During the hearings, Avenatti proceeded to bird-dog both Booker and Harris. In a two-tweet thread, which followed a dramatic interrogation of Kavanaugh by Harris that has failed to amount to anything, he cautioned: \u201cI sincerely hope (1) those four docs that were released this morning by Mr. Booker really were still confidential, so he can prove the GOP is lying and (2) that Ms. Harris discloses the evidence of the communications she suggested last night exists and then eviscerates Kavanaugh. Because if not ... \u201d\n\nWe can finish his sentence: If not, it shows these pretenders don\u2019t know how to fight the way I do.\n\nTo follow the call to put down the clippers and pick up the gun with an embrace of court-packing clarifies what exactly Avenatti means by fighting harder: fighting without restraint by governing norms. Avenatti is tapping into a desire on the left to burn the rulebook that has simmered since the 2000 presidential recount. In the opening of the 2004 agitprop film Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore skewered runner-up Al Gore, who resisted the unofficial tally for 35 days, for ultimately accepting legal and constitutional reality. Moore\u2019s movie revisited the spectacle when Gore, as president of the Senate, had the unfortunate ceremonial role of certifying the 2000 Electoral College count. Several House Democrats made a last-ditch attempt to object, but Gore turned them away because their petition lacked a Senate sponsor. Moore didn\u2019t acknowledge that Gore\u2019s actions were necessary to avoid a constitutional crisis that could easily have led to violence. He just demeaned Gore as weak and callous. \u201cOne after another,\u201d said Moore, the primarily African-American dissenters \u201cwere told to sit down and shut up.\u201d\n\nThis Democratic distrust of constraining norms intensified during the Obama presidency, which was constantly buffeted by Republican obstructionist tactics. When congressional Republicans would refuse to raise the debt ceiling in order to extract concessions, some (including Bill Clinton) called on Barack Obama to stretch a Civil War-related provision in the 14th Amendment and declare the entire debt ceiling unconstitutional. Others, like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman backed another legally questionable and economically risky proposal: for Obama to direct the U.S. Treasury to mint a trillion-dollar coin to get around the debt ceiling and pay its obligations. Of course, these proposals were in response to Republican threats to governing norms\u2014namely, seizing the full faith and credit of the United States for use as a bargaining chip. But you can\u2019t protect the sanctity of government debt obligations by undermining the sanctity of government debt obligations.\n\nIn the final days of Obama\u2019s tenure, calls rose for Obama to give Garland, the Supreme Court nominee whom Republicans refused to consider, a recess appointment. As the New Republic\u2019s David Dayen strained to argue, on January 3, 2017, there would have been \u201cmetaphysical\u201d space between the end of the 114th Congress and the beginning of the 115th, in which Obama could claim the Senate was in recess and appoint Garland without Senate confirmation.\n\nAfter none of those fantasies came to pass, and after watching Trump chew up and spit out norms as part of his daily routine, the movement of progressive norm-breakers has grown. Roosevelt University political science professor David Faris this year published It\u2019s Time to Fight Dirty, which called for packing the Supreme Court, ending the legislative filibuster, and breaking up California in hopes of creating more blue states and more Democratic senators. Now, Avenatti is poised to elevate court-packing to the level of progressive litmus test.\n\nIf the progressive credentials of the 2020 field become judged based on the extent of their disregard for norms, the progressive movement, the Democratic Party and American democracy will all suffer. If Democrats and progressives are perceived as driven by the accumulation of personal power, not the betterment of America as a whole, they will find it challenging to claim the moral high ground when making the case for their preferred policies. And if both parties continually rewrite the rules to consolidate their power whenever given the opportunity, faith in democratic institutions will erode and sow the seeds of authoritarianism.\n\nThe latter point was made by Harvard University government professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt in the book How Democracies Die: \u201cThis is how elected autocrats subvert democracy\u2014packing and \u2018weaponizing\u2019 the courts and other neutral agencies, rewriting the rules of politics to tilt the playing field against opponents.\u201d Faris finds this concern quaint at a time when Republicans have been engaged in scorched earth governance, akin to \u201cfretting about whether you should shoot the terrorist sitting next to you on your flight after he\u2019s already blown a hole in the hull.\u201d\n\nFaris\u2019 hyperbole obscures the fact that Democrats have reaped benefits not only from respecting norms, but also from occasionally ending them. Consider the demise of the judicial filibuster. While Republicans guffaw that Sen. Harry Reid largely scrapped it in 2013, only to grease the path of Trump\u2019s nominees, it is also the case that the rule change helped Obama overcome furious Republican filibustering and appoint two more judges than George W. Bush. Yes, Trump is going to get his share of judges, but Democrats will get another turn soon enough. That rule change didn\u2019t fundamentally undermine our norms; it allowed the usual political pendulum swings to maintain a rough judicial balance.\n\nEven so, if Obama had tried one of those cockamamie, and legally dubious, debt-limit schemes in his first term, the full faith and credit of the American government would have been called into question, risking an economic meltdown that would have effectively ended his presidency.\n\nAnd if Reid and the Democrats had ended the legislative filibuster, whatever ambitious laws they got passed under the new rules would have been repealed by a Republican Congress exploiting the same. Instead, today\u2019s Republican legislative output, and ability to roll back Obama\u2019s policy legacy, is greatly constrained.\n\nOr if the Obama Democrats had undermined the legitimacy of the judicial branch with a brazenly illegal recess appointment of Garland, Republicans could be ignoring Supreme Court rulings today as illegitimate. Keep in mind that there are conservatives\u2014most prominently Mike Huckabee\u2014who disparage the \u201cfalse god of judicial supremacy\u201d and urge Republicans in the other branches of government to ignore unfavorable judicial rulings.\n\nYet Trump and the Republican Congress have not gone that far. While we appropriately recoil at Trump\u2019s authoritarian musings, he has not dared violate the essential norm of judicial review, even though that norm is suffocating his project of dismantling Obama\u2019s regulatory legacy. Attempts to roll back Obama-era rules protecting student borrowers, maintaining chemical plant safety, regulating waterways, cutting methane and ozone pollution, and combating segregated housing have been blocked by judges, several of whom were appointed by Obama.\n\nDemocrats such as Avenatti who pine for court-packing don\u2019t look to Obama or Reid for inspiration but Franklin D. Roosevelt, who tried to do so in 1937. In their telling, Congress didn\u2019t go along with Roosevelt\u2019s scheme, but the Supreme Court underwent an ideological shift soon after his proposal, suggesting that the norm-busting won the overarching war.\n\nBut that version of the story misses a key fact: The Supreme Court justice who made the \u201cswitch in time that saved the nine,\u201d Owen Roberts, switched in a key minimum wage case in December 1936, two months before Roosevelt announced his court-packing plan. Scholars still debate why exactly Roberts switched. While it\u2019s possible that speculation of a court-packing plan factored into his thinking (though Roberts denied it), the fact remains Roosevelt didn\u2019t need to actually pack the courts to get what he wanted.\n\nMore important, Roosevelt\u2019s insistence on lobbying Congress for his proposal after the court had switched was a political disaster. The public was appalled at the power grab. Roosevelt\u2019s increasing alienation from conservative Democrats contributed to a 1938 midterm debacle that stymied his domestic agenda for the rest of his presidency. An old chess adage proved correct: The threat is stronger than the execution.\n\nIn a similar vein, Booker and his fellow Judiciary Committee Democrats weren\u2019t out of line in leaking \u201cconfidential\u201d documents that had no business being confidential. Booker\u2019s error was not in the leaking, but the boasting\u2014suggesting that his willingness to break rules was proof of his mettle. Harris is hardly the first politician to get a little overzealous in spinning the meaning of someone else\u2019s words. But it\u2019s hard to condemn Trump for disparaging the news media and then not submit yourself to the judgment of its fact-checkers. Even if the transgressions are not equivalently grave when assessed in isolation, they can feed a perception, however unfairly, that \u201cboth sides\u201d do it.\n\nWhen Avenatti says, \u201cWhen they go low, I say, we hit harder,\u201d he is explicitly encouraging both sides to do it. Such an attitude may become depressingly common as Avenatti sets the pace of the primary. Democrats need not be angels. A strategically employed sharp elbow has its uses. But a race to the ethical bottom should not be welcomed. A party that has been properly warning throughout the Trump presidency that \u201cthis is not normal\u201d should be careful not to become abnormal itself.\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Democratic Party\n\n2020", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:57.244589"}, {"id": "479cf03d70c9432c4b9ce915d8afba1bfc8ba8d9", "name": "Stormy Daniels Said Trump's Dick Looks Like Toad From Mario Kart And People Poured Bleach In Their Own Eyes", "url": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/trump-stormy-daniels-toad-mario-kart-book", "timestamp": "", "description": "\"The president is absolutely going to tweet about his Toad-shaped dick.\"", "keywords": ["sex", "looks", "kart", "wrote", "poured", "titled", "daniels", "share", "stormy", "trumps", "mario", "eyes", "dick", "smaller", "book", "smallit", "toad"], "summary": "We regret to inform you Stormy Daniels' new book includes a particularly colorful description of President Trump's penis.\nIn her memoir, titled Full Disclosure, Daniels said Trump's penis is \u201csmaller than average\u201d but \u201cnot freakishly small.\u201d\u201cIt may have been the least impressive sex I\u2019d ever had, but clearly, he didn\u2019t share that opinion,\u201d Daniels wrote in the book, a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian.", "content": "We regret to inform you Stormy Daniels' new book includes a particularly colorful description of President Trump's penis.\n\nIn her memoir, titled Full Disclosure, Daniels said Trump's penis is \u201csmaller than average\u201d but \u201cnot freakishly small.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may have been the least impressive sex I\u2019d ever had, but clearly, he didn\u2019t share that opinion,\u201d Daniels wrote in the book, a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian.", "clickbait": 0, "createtime": "2018-09-18 13:15:57.496172"}, {"id": "50dac094b81765e0baa97c46917070ad496d0a24", "name": "Senators: Natural gas pressure was 12 times normal level before Massachusetts explosions", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/09/18/massachusetts-natural-gas-explosions-pressure-ed-markey-elizabeth-warren-columbia/1345591002/", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T00:00:00", "description": "Senators are demanding answers about what warnings Columbia Gas had of blasts that destroyed as many as 80 homes in and around Lawrence, Mass.", "keywords": ["natural", "gas", "utility", "level", "massachusetts", "times", "pipelines", "senators", "pressure", "columbia", "state", "normal", "explosions", "12"], "summary": "CLOSE As investigators worked to pinpoint the cause of a series of dramatic natural gas explosions in three towns north of Boston, Massachusetts, Gov.\nThe pressure in natural gas pipelines before the explosions last week was 12 times higher than it should have been.\nMarkey and Warren are demanding answers from Columbia Gas and its parent company about the utility's response to the pressure readings.\nMore: Massachusetts explosions: Owner of Columbia Gas linked to three prior gas line blastsMore: Natural gas explosions: Boston-area gas pipes among oldest and leakiest in USMore: Massachusetts governor declares state of emergency after fatal natural gas explosions, directs different utility to restore serviceThe senators are seeking hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee.\nColumbia Gas, a subsidiary of Indiana-based NiSource, has not responded to requests for comment.", "content": "CLOSE As investigators worked to pinpoint the cause of a series of dramatic natural gas explosions in three towns north of Boston, Massachusetts, Gov.

With my brownish skin, unruly hair and seriously non-Anglo-Saxon name, I didn\u2019t resemble many foreigners\u2019 vision of an American diplomat: white, male, perhaps with a monocle to finish off the look. While serving at U.S. embassies in Jamaica, Egypt, Syria, Oman or India, I often was taken to be a local\u2014a mix-up I would use as a teaching moment, to explain that anyone, regardless of color or origin, could become an American and aspire to join our diplomatic corps. A young Syrian\u2019s reaction captured the usual outcome of such exchanges: \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re an American diplomat is what I love about America.\u201d\n\nThe State Department became less of a pale male club under secretaries like Colin Powell and Hillary Clinton\u2014who championed diversity and equality as institutional values\u2014and thanks to recruitment programs like the Pickering and Rangel fellowships, which brought hundreds of talented officers from under-represented groups into public service. As of June 2018, Asian-Americans represented 6.8 percent of Foreign Service generalists, slightly above the Asian-American share of the population in the 2010 U.S. Census, while Hispanic (6.0 percent), African-American (5.4 percent) and Native American representation (0.3 percent) lagged at levels well below their share of the population. Our progress on diversity was far from adequate, but for most of my career, across both Democratic and Republican administrations, I could say with confidence that my government was striving to build a diplomatic corps that looked more like America as a whole. As the daughter of Indian-American immigrants proud to be the first member of my family born in the United States, I rose through the State Department\u2019s ranks without perceiving that my ethnicity, gender or religion impeded my career.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat is, until the Trump administration. In 2017, as the media ran out of synonyms for \u201cimplosion\u201d in describing Rex Tillerson\u2019s tenure as secretary of state, a quieter trend unfolded in parallel: the exclusion of minorities from top leadership positions in the State Department and embassies abroad.\n\nThis shift quickly became apparent in the department\u2019s upper ranks. In the first five months of the Trump administration, the department\u2019s three most senior African-American career officials and the top-ranking Latino career officer were removed or resigned abruptly from their positions, with white successors named in their places. In the months that followed, I observed top-performing minority diplomats be disinvited from the secretary\u2019s senior staff meeting, relegated to FOIA duty (well below their abilities), and passed over for bureau leadership roles and key ambassadorships.\n\nBut it was not just a matter of turnover among a few top officials. According to my analysis of public data from the American Foreign Service Association, 64 percent of Trump\u2018s ambassadorial nominees so far have been white non-Hispanic males, a 7 percentage point increase from the eight years of the Obama administration. President Trump stands out from his six predecessors in his failure so far to nominate a single African-American female ambassador; African-American women made up 6 percent of all ambassadors under President Barack Obama and 5 percent under President George W. Bush, who had two African-American secretaries of state. Meanwhile, from September 2016 to June 2018, the share of African-Americans in the Senior Foreign Service\u2014the top ranks from which most career ambassadorial nominees are drawn\u2014dropped from 4.6 percent to 3.2 percent.\n\nA new glass ceiling is also thinning the ranks of female ambassadors, who represent 26 percent of Trump nominees so far, 2 percentage points above the overall share in the Bush administration but a 7 percentage point drop from the Obama administration. A 25-year upward trend that saw the percentage of female ambassadors increase with every administration since President Bill Clinton has now been reversed.\n\nThe State Department says it is working to fix all this. According to spokeswoman Heather Nauert, Secretary Mike Pompeo \u201chas placed incredible emphasis on staffing up the State Department and increasing diversity as well as reinvigorating and restoring the finest diplomatic corps in the world.\u201d Although the department did not dispute the decline in minority and female ambassador nominees, an official said the percentage of African Americans, Hispanics and women hired as Foreign Service officers had increased from 2016 to 2017. That\u2019s an encouraging sign at the entry level, but it does not address reduced minority representation at the senior level. With dozens of ambassadorial and other senior positions vacant, there is still time for Secretary Pompeo to reverse the slide in diversity among the department\u2019s leadership; it\u2019s worth noting that the Trump administration is not even two years in, while Obama and Bush each had eight years to shape the department\u2019s top ranks. But up to now, Foggy Bottom\u2019s upper echelons are looking whiter, more male and less like America.\n\nIn my own case, I hit the buzz saw that Team Trump wielded against career professionals after leading the U.S. Embassy in Paris through three major terrorist attacks over three years and after planning President Trump\u2019s Bastille Day visit. Upon returning to Washington, as accolades for the president\u2019s visit poured in, I was blocked from a series of senior-level jobs, with no explanation. In two separate incidents, however, colleagues told me that a senior State official opposed candidates for leadership positions\u2014myself and an African-American female officer\u2014on the basis that we would not pass the \u201cBreitbart test.\u201d One year into an administration that repudiated the very notion of America I had defended abroad for 27 years, I knew I could no longer be a part of it, and I left government earlier this year.\n\nA vast body of research has shown that organizations are more successful and innovative when they employ diverse talent; national security is no exception. As a March 2018 study from the Center for Strategic and International Studies concluded, \u201cThe United States must draw on its entire population to maintain its leadership position in international affairs. At the moment, it is not leveraging its inherent comparative advantage: its own people.\u201d\n\nOver the course of my career, I witnessed the remarkable impact that diverse teams\u2014women and men of all backgrounds\u2014had in formulating the multilateral response to the 9/11 attacks, assisting victims of terrorism, developing global protections for human rights defenders under siege, halting the spread of pandemic disease, and transforming the relationship between the world\u2019s largest and oldest democracies. Diversity is essential for diplomacy because of the human element that the job requires. As a reporting officer in the Middle East, for example, I was able to engage local women who were off-limits to male diplomats. And I have no doubt that my ability to connect with foreign audiences, from India to France, was aided in part by their appreciation of my own immigrant story. A less diverse diplomatic corps, especially at the top level, undercuts American national security by narrowing the scope of engagement at embassies abroad, constricting the flow of new ideas and perspectives, and contradicting the example of America as a champion of equality and opportunity for all.\n\nBut it is difficult to leverage diversity with a Senior Foreign Service that remains 88.8 percent white and more than two-thirds male. If the State Department is not going to acknowledge this problem, Congress should insist on a serious commitment to diversity in American diplomacy from Secretary Pompeo\u2014by demanding answers for the slide in minority and female senior representation at State, accountability if any officials have violated equal opportunity laws, prohibitions on political retaliation and protections for employees who report wrongdoing.\n\nNo one should harbor illusions, however, that a president who relies on \u201ccentral casting\u201d to make hiring decisions and routinely disparages African-Americans, Muslims, women and immigrants would champion those who don\u2019t resemble him. The most meaningful step toward rebuilding a State Department that looks like America is electing a president who cherishes our legacy as a nation of immigrants and diversity as one of many strengths that make our diplomatic corps\u2014and America as a whole\u2014truly great.\n\nUzra Zeya is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.

But that's not the case for everyone, and there's still a lot of work to do. Below are some of my favorite books which offer a refreshing perspective on mental health conditions, breaking through the cultural, social, and political barriers that can keep people from speaking openly. A mix of fiction and non-fiction, these books show what it's like when your brain seems to be working against you.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s memoir illustrates the devastating effects his bipolar disorder has on those around him. The descriptions of mania are gripping, all-consuming, and so intimate you feel like the pages have absorbed you completely. McDermott is extremely candid about how his disorder tests his relationships, in particular with his mother. However, through years of trial and error McDermott accepts that his illness isn\u2019t going anywhere. Lots of mental health memoirs end on a happy ending but McDermott is honest in saying that his mania and psychosis might return, no matter how stable his life seems. There isn\u2019t a sugar-coated happy ending \u2014 it's more a tale of trying your absolute best and learning from mistakes.

Wittels\u2019 memoir sheds light on grief and the devastating ramifications of addiction. While this story is heartbreaking, you can\u2019t help but draw strength from Wachs\u2019s courage and her determination to make sense out of what happened to her brother. The memoir is both enlightening in its descriptions of grief but also in its portrayal of addiction \u2014 how short stints in rehab can sometimes feel like a high, and how the \u201cjust one more time\u201d mentality is often the thing that kills. Get it from Amazon or Barnes and Noble for $15.99+ or a local bookseller through IndieBound.\n\nReading Yiyun Li\u2019s memoir is like having a close friend speak to you in a quiet, soothing voice. Li wrote her memoir over a period of two years while battling depression.

Fans of Daniel Johnston and his lo-fi, enigmatic music will devour this retelling of Johnston\u2019s humble beginnings, his rise to fame, and his personal demons. While the prose appears sparse it delves into the problematic mythologizing of troubled artists and how we are guilty of turning mental health conditions into clich\u00e9s.

Suzette comes back from boarding school to find her brother Lionel, who has bipolar disorder, in desperate need of her support. His condition spirals as Suzette tries to juggle her own conflicting signals of sexuality and desire. The book is extremely honest in its portrayal of mental illness, particularly how it affects sibling relationships, without veering into melodrama.

It might sound almost too outlandish to tell you anything real and rooted about mental health but Dalton\u2019s writing delicately explores themes of heartbreak, depression, and stifling versions of masculinity. The narrator\u2019s metaphysical road trip invites the reader to see how he\u2019s unable to fix himself with good intentions alone.

An uproar over this allegation Sunday pivoted quickly from the first question\u2014what\u2019s true?\u2014to an equally vexing one: What is even fair to be debating some 36 years after the fact?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt is on this point that the cosmos may be having a laugh not just at Kavanaugh\u2019s expense but at many other people\u2019s. After decades of competitive moralizing and situational ethics\u2014in which every accuser in due course becomes the accused, and anyone riding a high horse can expect to be bucked off\u2014even the concept of fairness in American politics seemingly is defunct.\n\nThree decades of remorseless ideological and cultural combat\u2014over Robert Bork, over Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, over Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, over Bush v. Gore, and, at last and above all, over Donald Trump\u2014have made the question virtually irrelevant.\n\nFairness is rooted in the idea of principles, precedent, proportionality. Few people in American life witnessed at closer range than Kavanaugh the modern reality that when things really matter\u2014in the way that the balance of the Supreme Court matters\u2014all these fine notions matter less than the cold, hard exercise of power.\n\nSo here was Kavanaugh\u2014who spent his early 30s as a Ken Starr warrior pursuing Bill Clinton for the political and legal implications of his most intimate moral failings\u2014now in his early 50s facing a political crisis over disturbingly vivid, passionately contested, decades-old allegations about Kavanaugh\u2019s own possible moral failings.\n\nFew prosecutors, it seems likely, would ever open an assault case\u201436 years later\u2014on the basis of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s account of being pinned down on a bed by a drunken Kavanaugh, then 17, and being aggressively groped until a friend of his physically jumped in.\n\nBut few prosecutors in the 1990s would have pursued an extensive criminal investigation over perjury into a middle-aged man\u2019s lies about adultery if that person had not been President Bill Clinton. In his zeal at the time, Kavanaugh, like Starr, may have worked himself into a belief that this was about sacred principles of law, but to many others\u2014and ultimately to a clear majority of the country\u2014it was obvious that the case was fundamentally about political power.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s fate, too, now depends on precisely the same thing: Do the allegations change the calculation for the perhaps half-a-dozen senators\u2014including Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\u2014whose minds were not already made up by earlier political calculations?\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Kavanaugh later concluded presidents should be shielded from criminal investigations of the sort he helped wage against Clinton. At the time, however, he was filled with righteous indignation. \u201cIt is our job,\u201d he wrote colleagues in Starr\u2019s office in an email, \u201cto make his pattern of revolting behavior clear\u2014piece by painful piece.\u201d\n\nCan Kavanaugh and his supporters really be surprised that opponents of his nomination will feel similarly righteous in wanting to examine allegations against him piece by piece?\n\nThere was ample talk Sunday of the political equivalent of a statute of limitations, especially with so many women who know Kavanaugh in a variety of personal and political contexts speaking on his behalf. But the people who plead for such a grace period now generally did not raise their voices in the 1990s when Juanita Broaddrick accused Bill Clinton of rape 20 years before or when Trump invited her to attend a presidential debate as a prop for him in 2016\u2014nearly 40 years after the alleged events in question and as way of deflecting allegations about his own sexist remarks and alleged affairs.\n\nWith a vote on his career-long dream of serving on the high court scheduled for three days from now, Kavanaugh can be forgiven if he is not in an ironic frame of mind.\n\nBut others can note that the dynamic at work in his nomination\u2014never mind arguments, never mind fairness, this is about votes\u2014is one that has often served Kavanaugh and his fellow partisans well.\n\nThe most vivid example may be Bush v. Gore, when Kavanaugh as a GOP lawyer helped the Bush team prevail in the courts after losing the popular vote and after a bitter contest about his effort to count votes in Florida. In a 5-4 vote, the alleged strict constructionists on the Supreme Court decided in Bush\u2019s favor even when the Constitution has no provisions for a contested election to be resolved by the court.\n\nThat was fundamentally a decision about power more than law, most Democrats reasonably believe\u2014and certainly it was made without reference to what would feel fair to Gore\u2014and it sent Kavanaugh to a senior job in George W. Bush\u2019s White House and then on to the federal appeals court.\n\nMerrick Garland could hardly be blamed for cursing the unfairness of being nominated for the Supreme Court but being denied a vote by Republicans waiting for the next presidential election. But presumably, Neil Gorsuch\u2014nominated by another president who took office under exotic circumstances after losing the popular vote\u2014is not burdened by the unfairness of it all.\n\nIt\u2019s a truth that Kavanaugh and his backers will reckon anew as they try to hold on to what even before Sunday was a very precarious margin of support. What\u2019s fair is in the eye of the beholder. But, even more, in the power-obsessed capital which he has happily inhabited his adult life, it is in the eye of whoever holds the votes.\n\nJohn F.

The United States is on track to admit only 22,000 refugees this year, about half the maximum allowed.\n\nTrump campaigned in 2016 promising tight restrictions on immigration, and his administration has sharply reduced refugee admissions through executive orders and closed-door decisions in the past year and a half.\n\nIMBALANCES\n\nIn the past year, the administration has tightened security vetting procedures that current and former officials say have slowed admission of refugees.\n\nRyan Mace, a refugee specialist at Amnesty International USA, urged Congress to oppose the decision as it finalizes fiscal-year 2019 appropriations.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is abandoning this country\u2019s promise to refugees,\u201d said Mace. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement demonstrates another undeniable political attack against people who have been forced to flee their homes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to far lower admissions overall, the type of refugee admitted has changed under Trump, a Reuters analysis of government data shows. The percentage who are Muslim is now a third what it was two years ago, while the percentage who are Europeans has tripled.\n\nThe shift has led to striking imbalances. Refugees admitted to the United States from the small European country of Moldova, for example, now outnumber those from Syria by three to one, although the number of Syrian refugees worldwide outnumbers the total population of Moldova.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo waves to the media before his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry at the State Department in Washington, U.S., August 8, 2018.

Rubio\u2019s office declined to comment but said it appreciated people were talking about the horrors of the Maduro regime.\n\nThe son of Cuban immigrants and the pride of Miami\u2019s anti-Castro exile community, Rubio has long been a critic of Venezuela, which he called \u201cthe new Cuba\u201d in a memorable speech on the Senate floor in 2014.

Without Kennedy on the court, the justices are split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives.\n\nThe president, who himself faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct that emerged during the 2016 presidential election, said he did not meet with Kavanaugh when the nominee visited the White House.\n\n\u201cI have never done anything like what the accuser describes - to her or to anyone,\u201d Kavanaugh said in a statement issued by the White House, his first comment since Ford\u2019s identity was revealed on Sunday.\n\n\u201cBecause this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,\u201d added Kavanaugh, who said he was willing to talk to the Judiciary Committee in any way it deemed appropriate \u201cto refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.\n\nKavanaugh has said he was not at the party where the incident allegedly occurred, according to a White House official\n\nThe comments by Ford\u2019s lawyer suggested any public hearing could be explosive.
