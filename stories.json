Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making,\\\" the unnamed official wrote in the staggering essay published by the Times\\n\\nThe official even revealed there had even been talk among Cabinet officers about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President. Washington has seen almost everything under Trump, but a palace coup would be something else.\\n\\n\\\"There is somebody working for the President of the United States at a very senior level who is trying to destroy him,\\\" Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\\n\\nIt's hard to find a parallel in Western political history for a leader to survive such a knifing since the power and fear need to sustain iron rule can slip away especially quickly in a democracy -- as opposed to an autocratic state.\\n\\nBut Trump has long defied predictions of his own demise and survived the kind of blows that would paralyze other presidents. Yet no other commander in chief has faced the staggering personal disavowals and devastating betrayals that he has endured this week.\\n\\nTREASON? \\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2018\\n\\nLike a wounded king's furious wail, Trump tweeted a single word: \\\"TREASON?\\\"\\n\\nWoodward was just the start\\n\\nThe legendary muckraker's deeply reported account exposes profound disdain for the President among senior officials who are said to view him as an \\\"idiot\\\" with a fifth-grade education who the world needs protecting against.\\n\\nIt turns out Woodward was just the appetizer.\\n\\nThe thunderclap of the Times piece laid bare an administration in disarray, a President dangerously off the rails and a nation adrift without the stable hand of an effective leader.\\n\\n\\\"Many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations,\\\" the official wrote.\\n\\n\\\"It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room ... this isn't the work of the so-called deep state. It's the work of the steady state.\\\"\\n\\nThe effect of the op-ed was to validate many of the claims of a President dangerously out of his depth that were made by Woodward, crushing White House efforts to fight back.\\n\\nWashington is already getting consumed with speculation about who wrote the op-ed, the city's biggest literary whodunit since the 1996 novel \\\"Primary Colors,\\\" loosely based on the Clintons, was revealed as the work of Joe Klein.\\n\\nThen there is a quickening debate over the decision of the author to stay in the shadows and whether the person should demonstrate their courage of convictions by resigning and revealing their name.\\n\\nUnimaginable questions\\n\\nBut Wednesday's staggering events -- extraordinary even by the convention-blasting standards of Trump, pose questions that would once have been unimaginable.\\n\\nThey include: What will happen if, as it appears, America does not have a stable, functioning President? Will the mutiny among unidentified senior officials build and will they break cover, provoke resignations, or further shred the fabric of the administration?\\n\\nThere is of course the perennial question of whether cowed Republicans on Capitol Hill will be moved to even discuss the crisis of competence and temperance raging in the White House. Then there is the issue of whether a crisis-addled and demoralized White House will dampen GOP turnout in midterm elections where a defeat could shatter the bond between Trump and his party.\\n\\nWhat must it be like to work in the confines of the West Wing, with a raging President, a cabal of officials working against him and the destabilizing spectacle of a witch hunt to find the moles?\\n\\nWill the President, seeing betrayal at every turn, launch a purge of officials he suspects may not be loyal to his political crusade, further thinning the ranks of a threadbare White House?\\n\\nHis darkest hour\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Trump responds to op-ed: 'Gutless' Replay More Videos ...

A gutless editorial,\\\" the President said, in an appearance in which he laid claim to a record of staggering political success, a roaring economy and building military might.\\n\\nLater, his mood had darkened and he delivered a truly sinister tweet.\\n\\nDoes the so-called \\\"Senior Administration Official\\\" really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source?

These are in no particular order.\\n\\nDon McGahn\\n\\nWe know the White House counsel is a short-timer -- planning to leave in the fall. We also know that McGahn has clashed with Trump repeatedly in the past -- refusing Trump's order to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. And McGahn has already shown a willingness to look out for the broader public good, sitting down for more than 30 hours with special counsel Robert Mueller's team to aid their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\\n\\nDan Coats\\n\\nThe Director of National Intelligence is very much a part of the long-term Washington establishment, having spent not one but two stints in the nation's capital as a senator from Indiana. Coats has also shown a tendency to veer from the Trump songbook. Informed of Trump's plans to invite Russian president Vladimir Putin for a summit in the United States this fall, Coats said \\\"That is going to be special\\\" -- a line that drew the ire of the President.\\n\\nKellyanne Conway\\n\\nConway, a White House counselor, is someone who has survived for a very long time in the political game. And not by being dumb or not understanding which way the wind blows. Plus, there is the X-factor of her husband -- George -- whose Twitter feed regularly trolls Trump\\n\\nJohn Kelly\\n\\nThe chief of staff has clashed repeatedly with the President and seems to be on borrowed time . Kelly sees his time in the job as serving his country in the only way left to him. Might he view exposing Trump in this way as a last way to be of service?\\n\\nKirstjen Nielsen\\n\\nThe head of the Department of Homeland Security is a close ally of Kelly, who we know has a very fraught relationship with Trump. And she has reasons of her own: Trump scolded her in a Cabinet meeting over the number of undocumented immigrants entering the country. Nielsen reportedly drafted a resignation letter but backed away.\\n\\nJeff Sessions\\n\\nSessions sticks out as a possibility for a simple reason: He's got motive . No one has been more publicly maligned by Trump than his attorney general. Trump has repeatedly urged Sessions to use the Justice Department for his own pet political concerns. And this week, Sessions found out that Trump has referred to him as \\\"mentally retarded\\\" and mocked his southern accent, according to a new book by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. Sessions is also someone who spent two decades in the Senate prior to being named attorney general by Trump after the 2016 election.\\n\\nJames Mattis\\n\\nThe defense secretary has been Trump's favorite Cabinet member. But the quotes attributed to Mattis in Woodward's book are VERY rough on Trump, though Mattis quickly denied that he ever said them. And if anyone has less to lose than Mattis -- he is a decorated military man serving his country again -- it's hard to figure out who that would be. Plus, Mattis is an ally of John Kelly (see above) and Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state that Trump ran out on a rail.\\n\\nFiona Hill\\n\\nHill, a Russian expert who joined the Trump administration from the Brookings Institution, a DC think tank, might have reason to so publicly clash with Trump. She is far more skeptical about Russia's motives than Trump -- and was notably left out when Trump and Putin huddled on the sides of the G20 meeting in Germany in 2017. She was a close adviser to national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who was removed from the White House . And, she was also reportedly mistaken for a clerk by Trump in one of her earliest meetings with him on Russia.\\n\\nMike Pence\\n\\nThe vice president is all smiles, nods and quiet, deferential loyalty in public. Which of course means that he has the perfect cover to write something like this in The New York Times. Pence is also ambitious -- and there's no question he wants to be president. But would taking such a risk as writing this scathing op-ed be a better path to the White House than just waiting Trump out?\\n\\nNikki Haley\\n\\nThe United Nations ambassador is, like Pence, one of Trump's favorites. She is also, however, someone deeply engaged on the world stage and a voice of concern when it comes to how the President views Russia and Putin. Haley, again like Pence, is ambitious and has her eye on national office. Would this service that goal?\\n\\nJavanka\\n\\nThe combination of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump -- Javanka! -- writing this op-ed would be right out of a soap opera. But that is sort of a perfect way to describe the Trump administration, right? Ivanka Trump said she would work to make her voice heard to her father , but there's little evidence he's listened much to her or her husband. Might this be a bit of revenge?\\n\\nMelania Trump\"}{\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Hear the entire NYT stunning op-ed\", \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/05/new-york-times-op-ed-full-bolduan-erin-vpx.cnn\", \"timestamp\": \"2018-09-05T00:00:00\", \"description\": \"CNN's Kate Bolduan reads the entire op-ed in the New York Times written by an unnamed senior Trump administration official.\", \"keywords\": [\"whats\", \"chat\", \"unfolds\", \"hear\", \"facebook\", \"oped\", \"messenger\", \"happening\", \"world\", \"nyt\", \"stunning\", \"entire\"], \"summary\": \"Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.\\nFind out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\", \"content\": \"Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

With some inside his administration announcing that trusted appointees are trying to thwart him, he now has support for any paranoid inclinations of his own.\\n\\n\\\"TRAITOR?\\\" was the one-word message the President issued via Twitter, as the world absorbed an anonymous opinion piece said to be written by a senior administration official and published by The New York Times. In it, the writer declared, \\\"I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.\\\"\\n\\nThe most troublesome parts of Trump's agenda involve favoring Vladimir Putin and other authoritarians while undermining traditional allies. His worst inclinations find him impulsively insulting friend and foe, provoking racial animus, lying, and railing against enemies, real and imagined.\\n\\nThe main problem with the shocking article, which seems unprecedented in American history, is that it could make Trump behave in an even more deranged way, as the palace intrigue grows more intense. The White House was already roiled by the early reports on Bob Woodward's upcoming book, \\\"Fear: Trump in the White House,\\\" which depicts an administration lost in what one insider was said to have described as \\\"Crazytown.\\\" Imagine what has happened within those walls in the wake of the anonymous op-ed.\\n\\nHours into the latest twist in Trump's incredible saga of disruption and corruption, a writer at the Atlantic was warning of a \\\"soft coup,\\\" and social media was ablaze with speculation over the Times op-ed writer's identity.

On Twitter, Vice President Mike Pence became a trending topic, as his proximity to power -- he would succeed Trump should the President resign -- made him one person who would obviously benefit from the perception that Trump couldn't handle the job and had to be replaced.\\n\\nSince his election, Trump's fear, to borrow Woodward's title, has been that he would be deemed illegitimate and somehow forced from office. Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's election interference, and Team Trump's possible collaboration in that effort, has long stood as the most serious threat to the President.\\n\\nThat probe, and its offshoots, led to Trump fixer Michael Cohen's cooperation with prosecutors. If Trump saw this defection as betrayal, and he surely did, news that several insiders at the White House are actively working against him will only make Trump livid.\\n\\nIll-tempered and erratic to begin with, a Trump energized by rage will be even more unstable and dangerous.

In addition to the anonymous appointee who is apparently among those running an inside resistance to the Trump presidency, we have learned from our previews of Bob Woodward's forthcoming book that White House staffers literally stole papers from the President's desk to keep him from reading or signing them because they said they worried he would make ill-considered decisions that would damage the country.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Stelter: NYT has only printed unnamed op-ed a few times in paper's history Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Stelter: NYT has only printed unnamed op-ed a few times in paper's history 02:53\\n\\nIn Woodward's case, we know the names of some of the staffers involved in what he calls \\\"an administrative coup d'etat.\\\" Those who stole papers from the Oval Office must be subpoenaed by Congress to explain themselves, because we deserve to know whether they have a good reason beyond just policy differences with their boss.\\n\\nSome are drawing comparisons between this op-ed writer and John Dean, President Richard Nixon's White House Counsel, who turned on his boss. But at least Dean had the honor to do so in his own name. Attaching a name to these grievances would carry more weight, because they would be backed by some measure of courage.\\n\\nI agree with the op-ed writer and a few of the President's former advisers outed by Woodward that some of Trump's impulses on trade and foreign policy are \\\"misguided.\\\" And like the op-ed writer, I am but one voter in a pool of nearly 139 million who turned out in the 2016 election.\\n\\nOur democracy is based upon us all agreeing to abide by the results of the Electoral College in presidential elections, and that goes for everyone -- including people who work for the federal government in unelected capacities.\\n\\nThe founding fathers provided three tools to stop a runaway presidency -- elections, impeachment, and invoking the 25th amendment. The Times op-ed writer admits that no one in the Trump administration \\\"wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis\\\" by invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of a president. This tells me that the writer's concerns aren't widely held enough to actually rally a constitutionally allowable coup against the President.\\n\\nThat leaves impeachment, which I suspect House Democrats will pursue come January if they take over the House of Representatives via elections in November. Strangely, Democratic leaders must not believe impeachment to be a winning message, as they continuously try to tamp down talk of it on the campaign trail, despite the desire of their base to toss Trump in the Potomac River.\\n\\nDonald Trump has certainly done some things that are not defensible, including his comments about white supremacists after Charlottesville and his disastrous press conference with Vladimir Putin. His administration has also done things, as the op-ed writer admits, that have been successful for the nation (although the writer questions whether the President was responsible for any of the positive developments).\\n\\nBut whether one agrees or disagrees with any personal or policy flaw of the President, the actions of this unelected, appointee op-ed writer \\u2014and whomever else has joined this person in an internal \\\"resistance\\\" to this President \\u2014 send a terrible signal. The author complains that Trump is undermining institutions, but I am not sure the op-ed writer is doing anything to strengthen them by acting contrary to the Constitution.\\n\\nThe writer would do well to view the situation through the prism of an average, middle-American voter who selected Trump less than two years ago. That person is likely to believe that the economy is humming, that optimism is rising, that the President is appointing good judges, and that even the Congress is operating efficiently in what is supposedly a chaotic environment.\\n\\nThere are better ways to handle this beyond signaling that elections and our constitution have lost their usefulness as the means to enact change. Perhaps allowing an election to pass, so that actual voters can consider the facts and render a judgment, is more prudent than circumventing the established constitutional order that has served our republic well.\"}{\"id\": 8, \"name\": \"John Kerry: 'This is a genuine constitutional crisis'\", \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/john-kerry-constitutional-crisis-cnntv/index.html\", \"timestamp\": \"2018-09-05T00:00:00\", \"description\": \"Former Secretary of State John Kerry said the country faces \\\"a genuine constitutional crisis\\\" following Bob Woodward's reporting on President Donald Trump's dysfunctional White House and the unnamed senior administration official's op-ed assailing Trump in The New York Times on Wednesday.\", \"keywords\": [\"kerry\", \"trumps\", \"unnamed\", \"crisis\", \"white\", \"house\", \"secretary\", \"woodwards\", \"times\", \"senior\", \"john\", \"genuine\", \"trump\", \"constitutional\"], \"summary\": \"(CNN) Former Secretary of State John Kerry said the country faces \\\"a genuine constitutional crisis\\\" following Bob Woodward's reporting on President Donald Trump's dysfunctional White House and the unnamed senior administration official's op-ed assailing Trump in The New York Times on Wednesday.\\n\\\"We have a presidency which is off the rails,\\\" Kerry told Anderson Cooper on CNN's \\\"Anderson Cooper 360.\\\"\\nIn the Times op-ed , the unnamed senior Trump administration official attacked the President's \\\"amorality\\\" and reckless decision-making and said he or she is part of a \\\"resistance\\\" working to thwart Trump's worst impulses.\\nWoodward's new book, \\\"Fear: Trump in the White House,\\\" which exploded onto the political scene Tuesday, paints a portrait of a chaotic, dysfunctional White House under Trump.\\n\\\"We see the evidence of people stealing a presidential document off his desk,\\\" Kerry said, referencing Woodward's reporting.\", \"content\": \"(CNN) Former Secretary of State John Kerry said the country faces \\\"a genuine constitutional crisis\\\" following Bob Woodward's reporting on President Donald Trump's dysfunctional White House and the unnamed senior administration official's op-ed assailing Trump in The New York Times on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"We have a presidency which is off the rails,\\\" Kerry told Anderson Cooper on CNN's \\\"Anderson Cooper 360.\\\" \\\"We have a President who is not capable of doing the job, who clearly has these temper tantrums, doesn't know enough to be making many of the decisions he makes.\\\"\\n\\nIn the Times op-ed , the unnamed senior Trump administration official attacked the President's \\\"amorality\\\" and reckless decision-making and said he or she is part of a \\\"resistance\\\" working to thwart Trump's worst impulses.\\n\\nWoodward's new book, \\\"Fear: Trump in the White House,\\\" which exploded onto the political scene Tuesday, paints a portrait of a chaotic, dysfunctional White House under Trump.\\n\\n\\\"We see the evidence of people stealing a presidential document off his desk,\\\" Kerry said, referencing Woodward's reporting. \\\"We see a general, the secretary of defense, ordered to kill another leader -- a leader of another country -- who turns to everybody after the phone is hung up and says, 'I'm not gonna do that.

The Daily Caller reporters asked the President if he had watched any of the confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's pick for the Supreme Court.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats have put on quite a show, have you kept up with it?\\\" one of the reporters notes. And with that, Trump launches into this answer about protests:\\n\\n\\\"I'm amazed that people allow the interruption to continue. You know, there are some people that just keep screaming at the same people. In the old days we used to throw them out. Today I guess they just keep screaming. I thought Sen. (Orrin) Hatch was good because he was very indignant at the interruptions by a woman that was up there that just kept going on and on. I don't know why they don't, why they don't take care of a situation like that because it's terrible. I think it's embarrassing for the country to allow protesters, you don't even know which side the protesters were on. But to allow someone to stand up and scream from the top of their lungs and nobody does anything about it is frankly \\u2014 I think it's an embarrassment. I think, well it's really early stages, but I think the Democrats are grasping at straws, that looks like to me. It's incredible how bipartisan everything, when you look at how the opposite, I mean, when you look at how the level of division between the two sides, it's sort of incredible.\\\"\\n\\nThere's no question the Kavanaugh hearings have been repeatedly interrupted by protesters. According to the Capitol Police , 70 protesters were arrested across the Capitol complex on Tuesday for protests tied to the Kavanaugh hearings. Within seconds of the opening of the hearings on Wednesday, protesters were being dragged from the room.\\n\\nUtah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch was particularly bothered by the repeated interruptions from protesters claiming that Kavanaugh should never be seated for a variety of reasons. \\\"I don't know that the committee should have to put up with the type of insolence taking place in this room today, \\\" Hatch said at one point . At another point, he urged Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to \\\"have this loudmouth removed,\\\" referring to a protester.\\n\\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham asked Wednesday, \\\"What kind of country do we live in where the Supreme Court candidate can't bring his children to the hearing?\\\"\\n\\nThe conservative internet was similarly up in arms, noting that these sorts of protests didn't happen when confirmation hearings were held for former President Barack Obama's picks to the Supreme Court. (Nota bene : There were protests and arrests during Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation hearings , although they were less numerous than in the first day of Kavanaugh.)\\n\\nHere's the reality: The protests are disruptive. Before the protesters are escorted out of the committee room, they make quite the ruckus. Their shouts often drown out a question from a senator or an answer from Kavanaugh. At the same time: What these people are doing is constitutionally protected.\\n\\nMost of the people being arrested for protesting are waiting in the line for the public to enter the hearings. (There are several rows of seats in the Judiciary Committee room reserved for a rotating group of average citizens.) Once in the hearings, they are protesting. They are doing so knowing they will be arrested for civil disobedience.\\n\\nProtest and dissent -- vocal and peaceful -- has a long history in the United States. From women's suffrage to the civil right movements, protest helped shine a light on injustice. That's not to say that the protests plaguing the Kavanaugh hearings are that same sort of historic moment, or that putting him on the Supreme Court is a universally agreed-upon injustice.\\n\\nBut it is to say that when the President of the United States openly wonders why protests are allowed, it creates a chilling echo of authoritarian regimes in which dissent is crushed by the government. Even broaching the idea that protests should not be allowed suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which free speech should and does work. In Trump's mind, people who protest don't like America -- and should get the hell out. In reality, the right to speak out -- even and especially when that speech takes the form of protest -- is deeply intertwined with what makes America, well, America.\"}{\"id\": 13, \"name\": \"Book states Trump claims to be Hemingway of Twitter\", \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/06/donald-trump-hemingway-twitter-moos-erin-pkg-vpx.cnn\", \"timestamp\": \"2018-09-06T00:00:00\", \"description\": \"President Donald Trump calls himself \\\"the Ernest Hemingway\\\" of Twitter, according to Bob Woodward's new book.

Wade's right to abortion as settled -- \\\"important precedent\\\" -- yet he has also narrowly interpreted when a woman can exercise that right.\\n\\nHis past views, reinforced by testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, suggest Kavanaugh would permit government to impose stricter regulation of abortion, for example, with additional requirements that could delay the procedure or in stiffer rules for physicians who would perform it.\\n\\nWith the departure of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, abortion rights could hang on Kavanaugh's vote. His critics have warned that with a new ninth justice Kavanaugh, the court would outright reverse the 1973 milestone that made abortion legal nationwide.\\n\\nIf Roe is overturned, abortion law would be set on a state-by-state basis, as President Donald Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh, declares he wants.\\n\\nBut Roe and abortion rights are not an all-or-nothing proposition.\\n\\nEven as Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, for example, have not voted to overturn Roe, they have narrowly interpreted its breadth and declined to strike down tough state restrictions on abortion.\\n\\nRoberts and Alito were among dissenting justices as the Supreme Court in 2016 -- with Kennedy's crucial vote in the majority -- invalidated Texas regulations on clinics and physicians that performed abortions.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, under questioning from Democrats, Kavanaugh declined invitations to promise he would not vote to reverse Roe, saying it would violate judicial norms to promise a vote on any particular case.\\n\\n\\\"As a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade,\\\" Kavanaugh said.\\n\\nBut perhaps more revealing, as he expressed regard for Roe and a 1992 decision (Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania) that reaffirmed Roe, Kavanaugh elaborated on why he dissented when his US appeals court allowed a 17-year-old woman to end her pregnancy, over objections from the Trump administration.\\n\\nKavanaugh had declared that the DC Circuit majority's opinion would lead to a new right for \\\"immediate abortion on demand.\\\"\\n\\nHis testimony Wednesday on the case, first in an exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin, offered a window into his thinking. As the Illinois Democrat asserted Kavanaugh would impose a new requirement to a woman's exercise of the abortion right, Kavanaugh emphasized his concern for the young woman who was being held in a US detention center in Texas.\\n\\n\\\"She's in an immigration facility in the United States. She's from another country. She does not speak English. She's by herself,\\\" Kavanaugh said, defending his view in Garza v. Hargan that the Trump administration could require her to find a sponsor before obtaining an abortion. Kavanaugh said the teen could have been able to \\\"consult with\\\" the sponsor as she faced her decision.\\n\\nThe DC Circuit majority found that the Trump administration was imposing an \\\"undue burden\\\" on the woman, violating her constitutional right.\\n\\n\\\"The government's conduct in the case had already forced her to delay her decision on an abortion by several weeks,\\\" Durbin told Kavanaugh.\\n\\nKavanaugh responded that he had turned to Supreme Court precedent testing laws that require a teenager to notify or get permission from a parent before obtaining an abortion. In his dissent, Kavanaugh acknowledged that, \\\"Those laws, of course, may have the effect of delaying an abortion.\\\"\\n\\nThe DC Circuit majority read Supreme Court precedent differently because the 17-year-old who had crossed the southern border had already fulfilled the requirements of state law for a minor trying to obtain an abortion. A Texas court had determined that she could decide what was in her best interests.\\n\\nKavanaugh had written that the administration was not forcing the young woman to obtain consent from a sponsor. \\\"It is merely seeking to place the minor in a better place when deciding whether to have an abortion,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAs Durbin noted that other judges read abortion-rights differently, Kavanaugh added, \\\"I did the best to follow precedent ... I did my level best in an emergency posture, I had basically two days to do this case.\\\"\\n\\nIn separate questioning on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal noted that Kavanaugh, a 12-year veteran of the DC Circuit, was not on Trump's list of Supreme Court candidates until November 2017, one month after his dissenting opinion in Garza v. Hargan. The Connecticut Democrat said it looked as if Kavanaugh landed on the list because of his view blasting what Kavanaugh described as \\\"abortion on demand.\\\"\\n\\nKavanaugh rejected that idea. He said he believed Trump added him to the list because \\\"a lot of judges and lawyers I know\\\" urged the consideration \\\"based on my record from the past 12 years.\\\"\"}{\"id\": 17, \"name\": \"Kavanaugh says 'no one is above the law' but ducks questions about Trump\", \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/supreme-court-nomination-hearing-brett-kavanaugh/index.html\", \"timestamp\": \"2018-09-05T00:00:00\", \"description\": \"Brett Kavanaugh spent much of 12 hours in a packed and raucous Senate hearing room Wednesday trying not to talk about politics -- or how he would act in cases involving the man who nominated him to the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump.\", \"keywords\": [\"supreme\", \"ducks\", \"law\", \"questions\", \"court\", \"president\", \"kavanaugh\", \"sitting\", \"democrats\", \"hearing\", \"sen\", \"trump\", \"political\"], \"summary\": \"\\\"No one is above the law in our constitutional system,\\\" Kavanaugh said, adding that the presidency is not a monarchy.\\nHe declined to say if a sitting president must respond to a subpoena, and would not budge when asked whether a president could pardon himself.\\nOn whether he would recuse himself if an issue involving the President's criminal or civil liability came before the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh said: \\\"I should not and may not make a commitment.\\\"\\n\\\"I am not here to assess comments made in the political arena, because the risk is I'll be drawn into the political arena,\\\" Kavanaugh said.\\nKavanaugh has not only testified twice before, he worked on judicial nominations while serving in the George W.

Jeff Flake asked about Trump's recent tweet on the Justice Department prosecuting two Republican congressmen -- both early Trump allies.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think we want judges commenting on the latest political controversy, because that would ultimately lead the people to doubt whether we're independent or whether we're politicians in robes, and so maintaining that strict independence of the judiciary requires me, I think, to avoid commenting on any current events,\\\" Kavanaugh said.\\n\\nHe repeated that sentiment just before 10 p.m. Wednesday night, when Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris asked about Trump's claim that \\\"both sides\\\" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville last year.\\n\\n\\\"I am not here to assess comments made in the political arena, because the risk is I'll be drawn into the political arena,\\\" Kavanaugh said.\\n\\nAbortion and gun control\\n\\nOver and over Wednesday, Kavanaugh, who was calm and disciplined during a long day of scrutiny from Democrats under pressure from grassroots activists to show vigorous resistance to Trump's nominee, argued that judges must be independent and must confine their rulings to precedent.\\n\\nOn abortion, Kavanaugh said that he viewed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision upholding a woman's right to an abortion as settled precedent of the Supreme Court under the doctrine of stare decisis.\\n\\nRoe v. Wade is \\\"entitled to respect\\\" he said, adding that he understands the passion around the decision.\\n\\n\\\"I don't live in a bubble. I understand. I live in the real world. I understand the importance of the issue,\\\" he said.\\n\\nBut Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein raised doubts that a nominee's position would hold when it comes to ruling on abortion from the bench.\\n\\n\\\"When the subject comes up, the person says we will follow stare decisis, and then they get confirmed and they don't,\\\" she said of previous nominees.\\n\\nFeinstein also chose to drill down on gun control and school shootings, asking Kavanaugh to explain his dissent in a 2011 DC Circuit case upholding the District of Columbia's ban on the possession of most semi-automatic rifles.\\n\\nKavanaugh argued that his reasoning was based on the Supreme Court's majority decision in the Heller case, a 2008 ruling authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, that held that semi-automatic rifles were constitutionally protected.\\n\\nWhile decrying gun violence and sympathizing with Feinstein's horror over school shootings, Kavanaugh said, \\\"I understand the issue, but as a judge, my job was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court whether I agree with it or disagree with it.\\\"\\n\\nWednesday's testimony was frequently interrupted by protestors who were led screaming out of the hearing room. But the proceedings lacked the bitterness and partisan sniping that characterized the opening day of the hearing on Tuesday.\\n\\nDemocrats are under pressure to show their voters that they have the backbone to challenge the administration and also want to make clear to their voters the huge stakes of getting out to vote -- since the GOP victory in 2016 gave Trump the chance to significantly tug the Supreme Court to the right, possibly for decades.\\n\\nThe President himself said that he was pleased with Kavanaugh's performance so far, saying he was \\\"born for the position.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I watched today for a little while. I saw some incredible answers to some very complex questions,\\\" Trump told reporters.\\n\\nHas support from Manchin, GOP senators\\n\\nIn order to stop Kavanaugh from being confirmed, Democrats must keep their entire coalition together in the Senate and hope to pick off two Republicans, with the most likely options being Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins of Maine.\\n\\nBut there is also the chance that some Democrats, facing tough re-election races in states that Trump won handsomely in 2016, will be forced by their own hopes of political survival to vote for Kavanaugh.\\n\\nOne potential Democratic defector, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, told CNN that he has so far seen nothing disqualifying in the nominee's testimony.\\n\\n\\\"He's handled himself very professionally. ... His dialogue is more specific in his approach to being a jurist,\\\" Manchin said, adding that he felt the behavior of Republican and Democratic senators in the hearing had been deplorable. \\\"That's what makes people sick,\\\" he said.\\n\\nRepublicans, meanwhile, remain confident. Kavanaugh has not only testified twice before, he worked on judicial nominations while serving in the George W. Bush White House. He understands the process better than most.

Batten Professor of Public Policy at Davidson College. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) If, as Bob Woodward alleges and is being reported in early extracts of his tell-all book about the Trump White House, President Trump called his Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an Alabama resident, a \\\"dumb Southerner,\\\" he may have finally done something he has long been unable to do: unite black and white Southerners.\\n\\nWe may not agree politically; actually, we disagree passionately on most issues. We don't see eye-to-eye on the issue of race and Confederate monuments and memorials. Even our views of Jesus and Christianity are diverging and increasingly at odds. But boy are we tired of having to contend with the stereotype that we are slow and unintelligent.\\n\\nThis side of the n-word, \\\"dumb Southerner\\\" is maybe the most impactful epithet you can throw at someone in the South. \\\"Mentally retarded,\\\" another term Trump reportedly used to describe Sessions, is also high on the list. Trump has since tweeted a denial of using either term.\\n\\nCalling Southerners some version of dumb is so effective that even Southerners do it to get under each other's skin.\\n\\nResidents of South Carolina rejoice by thanking God they aren't Mississippians, who often show up at the bottom of good rankings and the top of bad ones , with South Carolina usually one rung above.\\n\\nNorth Carolinians are proud to be home to the New South city Charlotte and the Research Triangle that includes high-profile universities, which makes it easier for the state to claim world-class status and deny that this stereotype applies to them, too.\\n\\nSuch slurs pick at an open scab, that of school districts in the South repeatedly showing up at the bottom of educational lists and too high on lists about heart disease. It is a scab that is reopened every time an A-list Hollywood actor speaks in a distorted, haunting drawl to try to sound genuine when portraying down-on-their-luck, unsophisticated Southern-based characters on the big screen.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Lemon on Woodward book: This is really ominous Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lemon on Woodward book: This is really ominous 05:15\\n\\nIt stings us all, black and white. We are tired of having to remind people that we don't \\\"talk different\\\" any more than do Bostonians or Bronx residents, that the pace of the words that flow from our mouths is not indicative of the intellectual activity taking place inside our heads.\\n\\nThat's why even Trump ally Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, said \\\"I resent that\\\" when asked about Trump's use of the epithet.\\n\\nA version of the slur was used in 2000 by a high-profile South Carolina state senator, Arthur Ravenel, for whom one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in North America is named, because the National Association of Colored People initiated an economic boycott of South Carolina to protest the flying of the Confederate flag at the Statehouse.\\n\\nRavenel caught heat for referring to the NAACP as the National Association of Retarded People -- then doubled down by apologizing to retarded people. He also later said he had mixed up his words because he was scheduled to meet with the SC Association for Retarded Citizens.\\n\\nIt was a way to put black Southerners in their place, to remind them that they would never be as good as white Southerners. Trump has turned even that racial divide on its head because he allegedly used the term to refer to a Trump-voting and supporting white evangelical Christian who served in the US Senate , was a captain in the US Army, received a law degree from the University of Alabama and is now the nation's top law enforcement official.\\n\\nIf Trump thinks that about a white Southerner with such a long list of credentials, there's little reason to believe he doesn't think the same thing about many of the white Southerners who always show up at his rallies to passionately praise and cheer him. What's worse is that the slur comes courtesy of a fast-talking New Yorker who never showed any concern for white Southerners, rich or poor, before he ran for president. And yet, I suspect, while black and white Southerners will be united in our outrage about the slur, many white Southerners will stick with Trump.\\n\\nJust days after he announced his intentions to run for the presidency, I spent time reminding white members of the Tea Party in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, area that they had more in common with me, a black Southern native, than they did with Trump. Our parents and friends struggled to stay safe doing dangerous work at nearby factories and were struggling to find a new way forward as those factories were closing. We spent a lot of time praying for each other. We needed a better healthcare and more adequate educational system. We shopped, side-by-side, in Walmart and cashed our checks at local credit unions. We ate at the Southern-style buffet restaurants.\\n\\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nTrump knew nothing about any of that, I said. It didn't matter. They flocked to him anyway, led by men like Sessions, the first sitting US senator to endorse Trump. That's why though I empathize with Sessions, and others like him who have to endure unfair slurs from men like Trump, I likely won't be shedding too many tears.

The NCAA vacated the Louisville Cardinals' 2012 Final Four appearance and 2013 national championship. His 770 wins also rank 13th all-time in Division I men's basketball.\\n\\nControversy often surrounded Pitino in his final years at Louisville.\\n\\nThe Cardinals had to vacate all of their wins and postseason achievements from the 2011-12 to the 2014-15 seasons. The NCAA ruled in October 2016 the program was guilty of four Level I violations stemming from a former graduate assistant, Andre McGee, who paid dancers to perform at on-campus parties.\\n\\nLouisville formally fired Pitino in October 2017 in the wake of the FBI's investigation into corruption in college basketball.\\n\\nAccording to ESPN.com's Mark Schlabach, a member of Louisville's staff worked with four men to funnel $100,000 to the family of a recruit for the purpose of getting the recruit's commitment. Schlabach noted the recruit was likely Brian Bowen, who was the No. 19 overall player in the 2017 class, per 247Sports' composite rankings.\\n\\nAs part of Pitino's wrongful termination lawsuit, Louisville alleged he knew of at least one school's attempt to pay Bowen's family to influence his decision.\\n\\n\\\"DePaul trying to pay Bowen 200 K to come there,\\\" Pitino wrote in a text message to former assistant Kenny Johnson, per WDRB's Jason Riley. \\\"Crazy world.\\\"\\n\\nThe school also accused Pitino of contacting Christian Dawkins, who was part of the group to allegedly secure the $100,000 for Bowen's family, and not disclosing their communications to Louisville's compliance office.\\n\\nIn his book released this year, Pitino: My Story, Pitino acknowledged his odds of returning to coaching were slim and expanded on that belief with ESPN.com's Jeff Borzello:\\n\\n\\\"There was one job this past year, that I really did want. They called the NCAA and the NCAA said, 'We're handcuffed. The FBI will not allow us to investigate, we can't give you a yes or no on Rick Pitino because we're not allowed to investigate. I'm not really thinking about coaching again in the future because I'm not in control of that. I feel it's over for me.\\\"\\n\\nStill, Pitino has a long list of accomplishments.\\n\\nWhen he took over the Kentucky Wildcats in 1986, the program was on probation as the result of multiple NCAA rules violations. Pitino took Kentucky to the Elite Eight in his third season and then to the Final Four a year later.\\n\\nPitino did the same thing at Louisville, taking a program that had stagnated under Hall of Famer Denny Crum and turning the Cardinals into a national title contender again.\\n\\nPitino's resume makes him one of the greatest college basketball coaches of his generation, but it seems the alleged recruiting violations have ended that career.\"}{\"id\": 37, \"name\": \"Pay 0 Interest Until 2020\", \"url\": \"https://www.comparecards.com/guide/pay-0-interest-until-2020?esourceid=6348406&utm_source=cnn&utm_medium=native&grp=pay-0-until-2020&pla=cnn.com&bdst=flat&acqs=prospecting&utm_campaign=newsandbuzz&tar=cnnnewsandbuzz&pos=1&utm_content=9+cards+charging+0+interest+until+2020&adt=none\", \"timestamp\": \"\", \"description\": \"We recommend these amazing cards charging 0% interest until 2020.\", \"keywords\": [\"card\", \"credit\", \"offers\", \"apr\", \"interest\", \"months\", \"long\", \"issuer\", \"pay\", \"intro\", \"cards\", \"2020\"], \"summary\": \"*Editorial Note: This content is not provided or commissioned by the credit card issuer.\\nAny opinions, analyses, reviews or recommendations expressed in this article are those of the author\\u2019s alone, and may not have been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by the credit card issuer.\\nThis site may be compensated through a credit card issuer partnership.\\nBanks are now offering incredibly long periods of 0% Intro APR interest.\\nOur credit card experts have hand selected the below cards because of their long 0% intro APR interest offers.\", \"content\": \"*Editorial Note: This content is not provided or commissioned by the credit card issuer.

The decision to remove the provocateur was a telling moment in Silicon Valley's efforts to get a handle on the spread of false information on its platforms while also trying to keep their roles as free speech advocates.\\n\\nTwitter continues to allow Jones to use its platform. He used Periscope, which is owned by Twitter, to livestream his visit to Capitol Hill.\\n\\nWednesday marked Silicon Valley's third high profile outing in Washington in less than 12 months. Dorsey and Sandberg used their appearance to outline the steps their companies have taken to tackle disinformation on their platforms and to make political advertising more transparent -- both part of an attempt to avoid a repeat of 2016, when a troll farm with links to the Russian government ran a disinformation campaign targeting Americans.\\n\\nBoth executives said their companies are now working more closely together to share information on foreign threats. But it took Twitter until earlier this week to remove from its platform an account that Facebook had flagged two weeks ago as being linked to Russian military intelligence. The account was posing as a Syrian activist group.\\n\\nIn her testimony, Sandberg underscored the importance of the companies receiving cooperation from intelligence agencies. \\\"Our understanding of overall Russian activity in 2016 is limited because we do not have access to the information or investigative tools that the U.S. government and this Committee have,\\\" she said.\\n\\nSandberg said Facebook was working closely with the FBI's new election interference task force.\\n\\nBoth also touted how their companies' efforts to combat fake accounts.

David slaying Goliath.\\n\\nSeriously, that's how one woman planning his football camp on this midsummer's day describes him. \\\"Because David,\\\" she explains, \\\"even when he rose, his brothers tried to throw him down. He remained humble.\\\"\\n\\nEditor's note: Doubt them. Hate them. Count them out. It's these guys vs. everybody this NFL season.\\n\\nPart 1 (Tuesday): Malcolm Butler\\n\\nPart 2 (Wednesday): Jon Gruden\\n\\nPart 3 (Thursday): Andrew Luck\\n\\nPart 4 (Friday): Marcus Williams\\n\\nDowntown, one bartender recalls Butler as an ultra-polite, ultra-down-to-earth upperclassman.\\n\\nAt Butler's old high school, at one end of the football field, Alonzo Stevens remembers Butler as a mix of two players he coached in college at Alcorn State: Steve McNair and Donald Driver. Both were incredibly tough\\u2014incredibly driven\\u2014and Butler, he says, was the two of them rolled up into one. That much was clear instantly to his high school coach. Don't let the Southern charm fool you, Stevens cautions, because when Butler steps onto the field, \\\"He wants to take your head off.\\\"\\n\\nAt the other end of the field, during Butler's youth football camp, trainer Johnny Jackson taps open a video of one of his other clients. It's 6'2\\\", 236-pound former Alabama running back Bo Scarbrough squatting 405 pounds, a clip that went viral just days prior. Then, Jackson's eyes widen. Butler? The 5'11\\\", 190-pound corner? Jackson assures he can squat 415.\\n\\nAt city hall, Mayor George Flaggs Jr. isn't shy. Butler has re-energized the town's economy, he says, while simultaneously injecting a generation of kids in Vicksburg with hope.\\n\\n\\\"They've heard Dr. Martin Luther King talk about it,\\\" Flaggs says, \\\"But they actually got to see Malcolm Butler be about it.\\\"\\n\\nThen, he cranks it up a notch. A few miles away is where the Siege of Vicksburg took place, a critical blow to the Confederacy during the Civil War. To Flaggs, that context is crucial to understanding what Butler represents in Vicksburg.\\n\\n\\\"We've been able to rise above what was fought against in this city,\\\" he says.\\n\\nNo wonder a city of 24,000 drew 10,000 spectators for the \\\"Malcolm Butler Day\\\" parade that was held to commemorate his interception of Russell Wilson at the 1-yard line in 2015.\\n\\nHe is living proof that a boy from this city can become a Super Bowl hero.\\n\\nBillie Weiss/Getty Images\\n\\nThe sight of Butler that day, in tears, hardly able to keep his body upright, will live on forever.\\n\\nImmortalized.\\n\\nForever an inspiration.\\n\\nBut, of course, there is another side to the Malcolm Butler story. He is, more recently, a Super Bowl zero. Three years after that interception, he stood on the sideline, benched by Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, powerless, in tears as his team lost to the Eagles this February.\\n\\nMaybe nobody in any sport has ever experienced such an exhilarating championship high followed by such a blindsiding championship low.\\n\\nThe greatest coach of all time humiliated him. Such embarrassment could be a knockout punch.\\n\\nBut it wasn't.\\n\\nButler has never forgotten his rock bottoms past, so this rock bottom will not finish him, either. After signing a five-year, $61 million deal with the Titans this offseason, he's hellbent on reclimbing the mountain.\\n\\nHere in Vicksburg, the reminders to keep climbing are constant.\\n\\nThey're at the local Popeyes, where he worked after he was expelled from Hinds Community College as a freshman. They're in the words of Jackson, the man who saw Butler at another humiliating low in his life. They're even in those bloated game checks he's now getting from the Titans, which Butler has noticed are printed by the same company that printed his old Popeyes checks.\\n\\n\\\"I've been an underdog,\\\" Butler says, \\\"my whole life.\\\"\\n\\nButler could have vanished long ago.\\n\\n\\\"I look at it like a scratch or a scab on your leg,\\\" he says. \\\"Pain don't last that long. You're going to heal sooner or later. So I just kept praying, kept working hard. Things blow over, man. They're going to blow over. No matter how bad it is...\\n\\n\\\"You've got to have that strong mind.\\\"\\n\\nThe Patriots stopped believing in Butler, but he never stopped believing in himself.\\n\\nSo do not be shocked if he's back to making game-changing interceptions. To being considered one of the league's top shutdown corners. Even to playing in the Super Bowl. Soon.\\n\\n\\\"It's hard to break me,\\\" he says, eyes piercing. \\\"I'm a tough one, man.\\n\\n\\\"I'm a tough one.\\\"\\n\\nPart of Butler absolutely wanted to approach Belichick that night in Minneapolis. But looking back, he insists he wouldn't change a thing.\\n\\n\\\"We all are going to make some decisions\\u2014some good ones, some bad ones,\\\" Butler says.\\n\\n\\\"It just didn't work out good for me or the New England Patriots organization.\\\"\\n\\nSteven Senne/Associated Press\\n\\nHe should be lobbing grenades one by one at Belichick. Because, hello, Butler is filthy rich now. There's no need to play nice. He's free of Belichick.\\n\\nBut not once in the days he spends with Bleacher Report in Vicksburg does he criticize the head coach he has every reason to criticize. Not once does he speak of Belichick with He Who Must Not Be Named disgust in his voice.\\n\\nBelichick should be a villain, a traitor, a vile despot who took Butler's precious fairy tale story, tore it to shreds and burned it to ashes. All that's missing is a lightning bolt on Butler's forehead. Yet as he lounges at his favorite gumbo spot in Vicksburg, hand on a knee, in a plain white tee, the complete absence of animosity is striking.\\n\\nButler doesn't trash his former team. He looks back fondly.\\n\\nHe cherishes the moment the \\\"508\\\" area code flashed across his phone and he headed to rookie camp as a tryout long shot, vowing to friends, \\\"I'm not coming back home.\\\" On to training camp, he told those same friends, \\\"A play a day keeps the coaches away,\\\" and lived his words. He picked off Jimmy Garoppolo constantly and, after his first time robbing Tom Brady, called Jackson to shout, \\\"I got him!\\\" (No explanation on whom was needed.)\\n\\nThere was an angry call to Jackson after a mid-December game, when Butler was used sparingly. Jackson slowed his roll\\u2014pointed out that Belichick had been playing him in important situations\\u2014and next thing Butler knew, he was stepping in front of a Russell Wilson bullet to win his team the Super Bowl.\\n\\nHe estimates he's been asked about that play \\\"millions\\\" of times. He never gets sick of it.\\n\\nAgain, he relives his one shining moment with pride.\\n\\n\\\"I was thinking to myself, If they run it, I'm not going to make the tackle. Unless it's a toss that comes my way. There's nothing I can do to make that tackle if he runs the ball in. But I said, If they do throw this ball, I'm going to be here. I saw Wilson kind of peeking over, looking, as he came out of the huddle. Those eyes don't lie.\\n\\n\\\"I said, If the receiver jabs right, I'm gone. If it's a double move, I'm beat. And I just went.\\\"\\n\\nButler's mind transports to that night, and he cannot help but speak in the present tense. He hangs on to this glory, still, years later. In that stack formation, Butler knew Seattle wasn't running a double move, so he tapped corner Brandon Browner. \\\"Who you got? Who you got?\\\" Browner mucked up the route. Butler attacked. Game over.\\n\\nAfter that came a tidal wave of attention, forcing Butler to grow up in a hurry.\\n\\nOnce his world slowed down, he buckled down and refused to fade away.\\n\\n\\\"Things really do happen like that,\\\" Butler says. \\\"Tyree, the Helmet Catch. He played, what, two, three more snaps? And he's done. I wasn't going to be that person. I wasn't going to allow that. I knew I wasn't going to be the 'one-hit wonder' the little kids hit me with on Instagram. I couldn't just drop off like that.\\n\\n\\\"I had to keep going. I had to establish myself. Once you're up like that, you have to add a little more to your resume and stay hungry. Stay hungry.\\\"\\n\\nButler started in 2015, won another Super Bowl in 2016 and played a team-high 97.8 percent of the Patriots' defensive snaps in 2017.\\n\\nThen, Belichick erased him from the game plan, just like that, in what will go down as one of the greatest mysteries in Super Bowl history. Browner, by then an ex-player, ranted on Instagram that Butler was \\\"not the first to get caught with weed,\\\" though Butler swiftly denied that that's what happened, as well as reports of missing curfew.\\n\\nMultiple Patriots players didn't respond when reached for comment. And there's Belichick, supplying zero clarity as always. Butler simply says in Vicksburg that Belichick gave him a chance to begin with and that he harbors \\\"no bad blood.\\\"\\n\\nHe says he respects Belichick and respects authority.\\n\\nButler even calls 2017 a \\\"down year,\\\" one he refuses to let happen again.\\n\\nThe night of that game didn't hurt most. No, this scab opened up in the days and weeks after the loss. Everyone around Butler was feeling bad, so he started feeling bad for himself. It was a vicious cycle. Plus, the timing of this was straight out of a horror movie. After fighting...and clawing...and overcoming Powerball odds to be in position to get his precious payday, Butler suddenly had one massive \\\"Buyer Beware\\\" red flag attached to his name in free agency.\\n\\nHe didn't heal overnight.\\n\\n\\\"It's not simple,\\\" Butler says. \\\"You can move on, but it's still going to be there. It takes time to move on. It takes time. It takes time to get over certain things that really put a dent in you.\\\"\\n\\nAnd at some point, Butler realized he was built to make this another career-defining moment.\\n\\n\\\"I'm going to fight,\\\" he promises. \\\"I'm coming.\\n\\n\\\"I'm coming.\\\"\\n\\nThe first coach to detect greatness in Butler wants everyone to picture a mountain.\\n\\nA jolly, stocky gent with a turquoise towel draped over his shoulder, Stevens speaks in a scratchy, soothing Southern dialect as he leans against a back fence.\\n\\nThere are two sides of a mountain, he says: \\\"The smooth side, where you climb, and the rough side, where you stumble.\\\" Moving his cupped hand up and down, Stevens assures that Butler has been climbing and failing his entire life.\\n\\nTo understand Butler's next move in 2018, understand Butler at two specific lows.\\n\\nFirst, at Popeyes.\\n\\nPoor grades prevented Butler from even playing his sophomore and junior years of high school, but he did enough as a senior to punch a ticket to Hinds Community College in Raymond, Mississippi. And then he blew it. Expelled from school for reasons he won't discuss, Butler crash-landed at the \\\"Louisiana Kitchen\\\" on Pemberton Square Boulevard. Stevens remembers ordering a two-piece at the drive-thru window and not believing his eyes when Butler handed him the bag.\\n\\n\\\"I'm going to get it right,\\\" Butler told him.\\n\\nStevens was skeptical. Very skeptical. But with each subsequent visit, he became less so. Butler told him he was going to enroll at Alcorn State to earn credits so he wouldn't fall too far behind. Butler told him he'd personally apologize to his head coach at Hinds.\\n\\nNot once did Stevens see a kid feeling sorry for himself.\\n\\nSoon, off Butler went to play football again at D-II West Alabama.\\n\\nThis is the same kid who'd get into receivers' faces on 3rd-and-15 in high school. The same kid with zero off switch, who'd hear Stevens screaming at him and scream back, \\\"I got it!\\\" The same kid who Stevens loved to use as a threat in practice, telling his other players they'd have to run until Butler was tired.\\n\\nThe play that defines Butler, to Stevens, isn't that pick in the Super Bowl. It was moments earlier, when he dove to deflect a pass, which then pinballed off every part of Jermaine Kearse's body before Kearse somehow caught it. Almost everybody forgets, he notes, how Butler popped up to knock him out of bounds.\\n\\nNot ironically, it was the exact type of play Johnny Jackson saw Butler make at West Alabama that made him want to train Butler. He recalls seeing Butler pop up off the dirt against North Alabama to chase down and tackle a receiver at the 2-yard line. He knew then that he needed to train him.\\n\\nAnd they trained. And trained. Jackson grew to love this \\\"strappy\\\" maniac with the \\\"cat-like reflexes.\\\" Yet when it was time to blip the NFL radar at Alabama's pro day\\u2014maybe it was nerves, maybe it was the fact that Jackson wasn't on hand\\u2014Butler ran a disappointing 4.62 in the 40-yard dash. No worries. At 4 a.m. the next morning, Jackson drove Butler to North Alabama to make up for it at that school's pro day.\\n\\nThen came another rock bottom.\\n\\nButler stepped up to the line and was waved off. Scouts yelled, \\\"We don't want to see him!\\\"\\n\\nTail between his legs, Butler got into Jackson's car and told him he was done with football.\\n\\nJerome Davis/Getty Images\\n\\nWhich, of course, enraged Jackson.\\n\\nAll along, the trainer planned on linking Butler with a Patriots scout he knew: Frantzy Jourdain. He shows a screenshot of Jourdain's business card on his phone\\u2014he was going to send this to Butler. After a thunderstorm had ruined Jackson's plans to meet up with Jourdain, he was able to still get his number. But beyond livid, beyond fed up with Butler's defeatist attitude, Jackson decided not to say a peep and kept that screenshot to himself. Why would he extend that life raft? The fire that drew Jackson to Butler to begin with was, evidently, extinguished.\\n\\nSays Jackson: \\\"I was so pissed. I was going to be a selfish prick.\\\"\\n\\nUntil one day at a red light, Jackson asked his wife if he should send Jourdain's number to Butler, she said \\\"yes,\\\" and the rest is history.\\n\\nNow pacing at midfield of Butler's camp, Jackson is smiling and speechless.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know if you believe in divine intervention,\\\" he says, \\\"but there is no way any of this happens.\\n\\n\\\"This kid was destined to be here.\\\"\\n\\nNo wonder Butler didn't break this offseason. The NFL team that took a chance on him abruptly decided he was not good enough...but Butler was prepared.\\n\\nOne book in particular served as the perfect prescription: Tony Dungy's Uncommon. Football never changes, Butler learned from the book. Neither does lifting weights or running wind sprints. What changes are people's attitudes. Butler realized he could run a wind sprint that is \\\"uncommon.\\\" He couldn't control the brutal timing of his benching, couldn't control whether any of the 31 other teams would pay up, but he could look inward.\\n\\n\\\"He deserves all the credit to not break down emotionally,\\\" Jackson says. \\\"You've got to have a strong backbone and a lot intestinal fortitude not to break down. Most people would've cracked.\\\"\\n\\nHe signed for $61 million, and the fact that Butler still never trashed the Patriots, Jackson smirks, is the true definition of \\\"power.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When you know you can throw those grenades,\\\" he explains, \\\"and you keep them in your pocket, that's powerful. That's uncommon.\\\"\\n\\nSo nobody here has a doubt what's next: Butler will climb, will conquer again. The same kid who boldly asked the Patriots to take back the No. 29 they had assigned him and give him 21 instead\\u2014\\\"Wear 6\\u00bd if that's what they tell you to wear,\\\" Stevens yelled to him on the phone\\u2014is starting anew.\\n\\nMayor Flaggs could hear the enthusiasm in Butler's voice the day he signed with Tennessee, and Jackson believes Butler will be playing free again this season. Last season, he believes, Butler \\\"played tense,\\\" with \\\"mental blocks,\\\" afraid to ever take Super Bowl 49-like gambles.\\n\\nThat won't be the case in 2018. The grenades may be tucked safely away, but everyone in Vicksburg knows that Belichick poked a bear, that he did the equivalent of waving Butler off at the start of another 40. Only this time, there were 103.4 million witnesses.\\n\\nFrom Flaggs in the mayor's office: \\\"We were taught in Vicksburg that when people say, 'You can't,' you say, 'You can.' It's in the blood of this city.\\\"\\n\\nTo Stevens, pointing at the football field: \\\"He's going to do it like he's supposed to do it\\u2014in between those lines.\\\"\\n\\nTo Jackson, who's now smacking his hands together: \\\"God, he's going to be motivated. Who wouldn't? He's got a chip on his shoulder.\\\"\\n\\nEven if Butler himself won't say it.\\n\\n\\\"I'll say it!\\\" Jackson shouts. \\\"Yeah, there's a fire lit. There has to be a fire lit there! And there's nothing wrong with that. It's a great thing. It's adversity. How are you going to respond to it? You don't have to respond to it negatively. Are you going to bitch and moan about it, or are you going to work your tail off and, when your opportunity comes, you're knocking on the door?\\\"\\n\\nThe fire has been lit, again, so the fire is now spreading. In Nashville. With Butler motivated like never before, the rest of the Titans will not hold back.\\n\\nTake it from Logan Ryan.\\n\\nThe ex-Patriot who helped recruit Butler to town kindly points out that the Titans went 5-1 in the AFC South a year ago \\\"and only got better.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And we're going to work,\\\" he says. \\\"We're as confident as anybody.\\\"\\n\\nThere's no doubt in his mind Tennessee can have the best secondary in the league.\\n\\n\\\"We saw Jacksonville kind of come out of nowhere last year with it,\\\" Ryan says, \\\"so we feel like that could be us.\\\"\\n\\nSuch is the Malcolm Butler Effect. Belief is real in Tennessee. Players like Ryan view Butler as their missing piece.\\n\\nRyan says Butler is a competitor who \\\"fears no man,\\\" who perfectly fits the punch-in-the-mouth ethos this Titans defense is building. There is no cornerback in the NFL he'd rather play with.\\n\\nTheir motto in the secondary, with Butler, is simple: My Man Catch No Balls. Position coach Kerry Coombs coined the term, and his players ran with it by printing \\\"MMCNB\\\" onto T-shirts and repeating the words at practice.\\n\\nMark Humphrey/Associated Press\\n\\nAll summer, each practice was handled with the tenacity of a playoff game by Butler, Ryan, Adoree' Jackson, Kevin Byard, every Titans DB\\u2014because their plan, in 2018, is to incinerate the receivers in front of them.\\n\\nWith the chip on Butler's shoulder more pronounced than ever, that attitude is contagious.\\n\\n\\\"He wins his matchup,\\\" Ryan says. \\\"I'm confident I can win mine. We're confident 'KB' can win his. We're confident Adoree' can win his. There's not a lot of open windows to throw the ball. When you have that, and you match it up with the pass rush we know that we have and our linebackers, then there's not a lot of windows. We want to make everything tough on everybody.\\n\\n\\\"I do sense that chip. It's fresh. He's running out with juice every day. We're treating every rep like it's game day. There's no chill days.\\\"\\n\\nAnd anyone who thinks Butler is trying to prove one coach wrong isn't seeing the forest for the trees.\\n\\n\\\"Every team passed on him,\\\" Ryan says. \\\"He's an All-Pro, and every team passed on him seven times\\u2014even the team that brought him in. So, he's had that. That's how Malcolm Butler is. He's proving everybody who passed on him wrong day in and day out.\\\"\\n\\nLike Flaggs, like Jackson, like Stevens, the Titans DBs watched last year's Super Bowl in complete shock. Safety Johnathan Cyprien couldn't believe Belichick didn't even use Butler in a single sub-package. But seeing the aftermath of that slight, that shock, firsthand is a beautiful thing. Butler hasn't uttered one word about that night to him privately.\\n\\nNot that he has to. His play is screaming.\\n\\n\\\"He takes it personal on anybody who lines up in front of him to try to catch a pass,\\\" says Cyprien, who will miss the 2018 season with a torn ACL. \\\"Even in practice. I can just imagine the game.\\\"\\n\\nCalling Butler \\\"a fighter,\\\" Ryan assures Butler will keep on fighting, because that's all he knows.\\n\\nAs for the newcomer himself, Butler doesn't hold back. He sees absolutely no reason the Titans cannot contend for a ring with Mike Vrabel in charge, with fellow ex-Pat Dion Lewis signing, with so many studs returning.\\n\\nThey'll contend this season, too.\\n\\n\\\"Most definitely,\\\" Butler says. \\\"Keep progressing, and we've got no choice but to make it there.\\\"\\n\\nAnd all roads in the AFC, of course, go through Foxborough.\\n\\nOnly Malcolm Butler knows if this latest scab has truly healed or if the wound's still open and susceptible to infection. There's a reason Tom Brady said in May that he wished Butler had played. A reason Belichick was still being grilled on it in late July. A reason we're all still baffled on the matter in September.\\n\\nMaddie Meyer/Getty Images\\n\\nEven now, seven months later, the benching is mind-boggling.\\n\\nIs there a skeleton Butler's hiding in his closet? As Stevens says, laughing, Butler will \\\"pee in that bottle,\\\" and if the Titans didn't have him do so before shelling out the $61 million deal, \\\"shame on them.\\\" The one team that'd seem to have insight into what might have happened in New England, other than the Patriots, is the Titans, whose general manager, Jon Robinson, worked for the Patriots from 2002 to 2013, and whose head coach won three Super Bowls playing for Belichick.\\n\\nIf there are no skeletons, Butler has every reason to hold a grudge. Randy Moss. Jamie Collins. Chandler Jones. He's the latest Patriot to be effectively kicked into the back alley.\\n\\nNevertheless, Butler thinks back to the last four seasons and smiles. The sight of Brady, \\\"awkward\\\" and \\\"weird,\\\" toting around a Trapper Keeper that he claims is fatter than James Harrison's arms will always be cherished. As will that first camp, that first Brady interception, that decision to jump Wilson's slant. Dungy's book and a new contract certainly helped him move on. But most of all, Butler realized that if anybody in the league can come back from such a public shaming, damnit, it's him.\\n\\nThat he's built for this.\\n\\nHis benching may be inconceivable, but so is his very existence in the NFL.\\n\\n\\\"You have to prepare for war,\\\" Butler says, \\\"at a time of peace.\\\"\\n\\nAs his youth camp wraps up, Butler takes shelter from the 95-degree heat in a nearby equipment shed. It's not much cooler in here. Musty, instead of humid. With a new challenge ahead, Butler adds that he's following one other motto: All gas, no brakes. He plays the Patriots on Nov. 11 and may again in the playoffs, but his story is bigger than exacting revenge on one coach.\\n\\nHe expects to stand atop another mountain. Soon.\\n\\n\\\"History will repeat itself,\\\" Butler says. \\\"It's life. There are just different levels of mistakes and bounce-backs. That's exactly what it is, because you move up, go to another level and make another mistake and you bounce back from that.

The reason is simple: Allen isn't ready, and Peterman is a better NFL quarterback right now. Allen's control of the offense, overall accuracy and ability to handle pressure have yet to reach professional standards.\\n\\nThe move is somewhat surprising, though, since McDermott decided to start the rookie during the third preseason contest\\u2014which is usually an indicator of a coach's intentions.\\n\\nInstead, the consistency and professionalism Peterman displayed throughout training camp and the preseason gave him significant headway above the team's available options, including AJ McCarron, whom the front office dealt to the Oakland Raiders for a 2019 fifth-round pick on Sept. 1, according to ESPN.com's Mike Rodak.\\n\\nMcDermott told reporters last month what he saw in the second-year pro:\\n\\n\\\"When you look across all the games, including practice, he has shown that consistency, which is good to see. A young player just in the start of his second season who has shown some poise and some understanding of how the NFL works in terms of defensive schemes. So I\\u2019ve watched him grow and develop, which is good to see. Still more work to do, but I think he has been consistent, which is important at the quarterback position.\\\"\\n\\nJeffrey T. Barnes/Associated Press\\n\\nPeterman led the league with an 80.5 completion percentage and tied for the lead at 10.5 yards per attempt among quarterbacks who threw 10 or more preseason passes.\\n\\nEfficiency is an underrated aspect of quarterback play, and the coach's praise for Peterman is also a slight toward Allen, even if unintentional.\\n\\nThe two are polar opposites. Peterman relies on timing, anticipation and precision while operating within the offensive's structure, despite obvious physical limitations. Allen falls back on his otherworldly natural gifts to makes plays. As a result, one is ready to shoulder the responsibility of an NFL offense while the other remains a developmental prospect who needs as much time as possible to study and work on his craft.\\n\\nMake no mistake: Allen is the franchise's future. He'll eventually become the starter. Patience is needed, though. Accuracy, or lack thereof, remains at the forefront of Allen's concerns.\\n\\n\\\"I think [Peterman has] been accurate,\\\" McDermott said, per Chris Brown of the Bills official site. \\\"We noticed that in college as well, but he gives the guys a chance to run after the catch, which is important.\\\"\\n\\nBuffalo Bills' preseason quarterback play (2018) Player Comp. % Yards Touchdowns Interceptions Sacks Allen 54.5 210 2 0 7 Peterman 80.5 431 3 1 2 NFL.com\\n\\nThe same can't be said of the first-round pick, who completed only 56.2 percent of his passes at Wyoming before the Bills made a draft-day power play to acquire his services. Excuses pervaded the predraft process about a poor supporting cast and a pro-style offense that didn't include easy throws.\\n\\nFacts are facts, and Allen never showed any consistent accuracy. So, it should come as no surprise that he's still struggling in that area. He completed 54.5 percent of his preseason passes.\\n\\nOverall completion percentage isn't even the best indicator of a quarterback's true accuracy. Ball placement is, and Allen admitted he hasn't performed well there either.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't do a good enough job getting the ball out on time and getting it to my playmakers,\\\" the rookie said after starting Buffalo's third preseason contest against the Cincinnati Bengals, per Rodak. \\\"Holding onto the ball is not going to be too great, most of the time.\\\"\\n\\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\\n\\nDraft evaluators often undervalue processing speed. A quarterback can have the strongest throwing arm in the world, and it won't matter if he's continually late working through his progression. An understanding of pre- and postsnap reads often determines whether a play is successful. Coaching staffs can hide deficiencies in these areas with simple half-field or single reads. Eventually, defenses adjust and expose the weakness.\\n\\nBeing mentally prepared for actual NFL speed and building an understanding of where the ball needs to go on a snap-by-snap basis separates good quarterbacks from those who never fulfill their potential.\\n\\nAllen's admitted to NFL.com's Kevin Patra that he's struggling with the speed of the NFL game, which could be damning in the long run.\\n\\n\\\"Getting out there with the first team, obviously it's moving really fast,\\\" he said. \\\"To see that speed, it was eye-opening. [Cincinnati has] a really good defense. They came out and they brought it. But at the same time, we had plays in place that could've worked if I got the ball out in time. It just didn't happen enough tonight.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes when the play clock got a little low and I couldn't really dissect what they were doing and understanding what they were doing, it's tough on a quarterback.\\\"\\n\\nHis head is still swimming. Allen won't benefit from game reps at this juncture, since his understanding of the position falls behind the curve, and the Bills face a brutal stretch to open the regular season.\\n\\nThe Ravens, Los Angeles Chargers and Minnesota Vikings are Buffalo's first three opponents. Each of those squads features a ferocious defense with elite pass-rushers. Allen's shortcomings will only be exacerbated playing behind a shaky offensive front, while Peterman is more likely to be composed, even with Terrell Suggs, Everson Griffen and Joey Bosa breathing down his neck.\\n\\nThe longer Buffalo can wait before Allen is forced onto the field the better. Peterman gives the team a chance to win now, while the rookie will be provided more time to learn and adjust.\\n\\n\\\"Josh Allen is on schedule,\\\" McDermott said, per the team's official site. \\\"I've been pleased with his development, and I know he'll be ready if his number is called.\\\"\\n\\nDon't get too far ahead of yourself, Coach. It's not in Allen's best interest to rush the plan.\\n\\nBrent Sobleski covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.

She has commissioned a series of features on visual language and imagining the future.\\n\\nThe definition of beauty changes all the time. And sometimes, as society develops, it goes in cycles, like the changing of the four seasons. Not so long ago, Chinese people saw fashion as something that came from the West. Afraid to make \\\"mistakes,\\\" they looked to Europe and America to see which standards had been set. As a result, fashion in China looked pale and blurry.\\n\\nBut now, the Internet, technology and social media have rendered the world flat. Fashion can be accessed from anywhere, with styles from around the world cohabiting and influencing one another. Go to a high-end Beijing department store, for instance, and you'll see shoppers holding Hermes bags and wearing Chanel tops with Uggs -- all while holding a string of Buddhist prayer beads in their hands. Fusion is the future of fashion.\\n\\nLike her peers, Chen has witnessed enormous change in China, and has sought to document the profound effect those changes have had on her generation, known as balinghou, or those born after the 1980s.

But I also believe that repetition is a disease -- and I don't want my work to reinforce stereotypes. Images of dragons and phoenixes are powerful, but when people use them again and again, they lose the power to be fresh or exciting. I want to capture the real contemporary China, not to please people with cliches.\\n\\n\\\"This relationship between technology and aesthetics is like that of science and philosophy -- in an ideal world, the two walk side by side,\\\" said Chen Man. Credit: dawei\\n\\nThe country my generation now inhabits is no longer isolated from outside information and ideas. I use technology in my photography, and I believe this is the future of visual art. If technology can help artists present things in new and better ways, why shouldn't we embrace it? There is no need for artists to live in the past. After all, we live in a world where artificial intelligence is so advanced that it can create art free from human input.\\n\\nChen Man's work is immediately identifiable -- fantastical, aspirational and imaginative, capturing beauty against often surreal backdrops. Credit: Chen Man\\n\\nAI is a new species created by humankind. We give it language and the ability to do certain things -- just as we do our own children. But, like a child, when AI has matured enough, it will develop its own language and its own abilities.\\n\\nWe may bestow AI with creativity, but that doesn't mean it can't be creative in its own right. Artificial thinking and decision-making is rooted in the power and experience of countless human minds, so it's only logical that this will result in better, bigger and more advanced brains than our own.\\n\\nIt has already created wonderful examples of painting and music. Yet, some critics question whether anything created this way can ever be considered real art. This is because most people have a limited understanding of AI. They see it as unfathomably complex, or the stuff of science fiction. But applying AI to visual art need not be high-tech. Even the simplest of photo processing apps owe their existence to the development of AI, and its applications will only widen in the near future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 / 22 A veritable A-to-Z list of Asian celebrities and models have posed for Chen Man.

Achieving such a balance requires artists to master both, combining art and skill in the process.\\n\\nVisual language is that which doesn't need translation. We are born unable to talk, but we can immediately see blue skies, red flowers and human emotion. What we see can make us feel pleased or worried, fearful or safe. For this reason, I believe that in a globalized world, the future should be -- and will be -- more visual.\\n\\n\\\"Visual language is that which doesn't need translation,\\\" said Chen Man.

The median savings balance among that age group, however, is just $6,200. And because that median is much lower than the average, it means most folks in their mid to late 40s have less than $81,000 and change saved. It also means there's a good chance a large chunk of 40-somethings have no savings at all.\\n\\nIf you're in that camp, you'll need to take steps to do better effective immediately. However, the good news is that if you're willing to make an effort, you can quickly start building some savings to ensure that you get to retire on schedule. Here's how.\\n\\n1. Lower some major living costs\\n\\nBy the time you reach your 40s, you're generally earning substantially more than you did in the earlier stages of your career and, as such, feel comfortable taking on greater expenses. But if you're serious about building some retirement savings, you'll need to start slashing your living costs to free up cash to put away. So, take a look at your budget, see where the bulk of your money is going, and figure out which major expenses you're going to cut.\\n\\nMake no mistake about it \\u2014 you will need to cut at least one major expense if you want a shot at a financially secure retirement. Scaling back your cable package might put another $50 a month in your pocket, as might packing lunch twice a week rather than buying it. But if you have virtually nothing saved in your 40s, it's going to take more than $50 a month to make up for two decades of neglecting your nest egg.\\n\\nSo, prepare to think big. Decide that instead of holding onto two vehicles, you and your partner will share a single one. Or, downsize to a smaller home and bank your resulting savings.\\n\\nWill doing so impact your quality of life? Yes. But it's better than compromising your retirement.\\n\\n2. Get a side job\\n\\nWhen you've worked for 20 years or so and have already paid your dues, the idea of working even harder might seem unappealing. But if you're willing to take on a side hustle on top of your regular job, you might manage to salvage your retirement without having to make some of the drastic compromises discussed above.\\n\\nFor example, if you're able to earn $500 a month on top of your regular paycheck, you can perhaps think about hanging onto your larger home and second car, and simply cutting a few smaller expenses to further pad your nest egg. Better yet, if you reduce some major expenses and get a second gig, you'll increase your chances of not only retiring on time, but doing so with quite a bit of money.\\n\\n3. Take steps to advance your career\\n\\nBy the time you're in your 40s, you've probably climbed the ranks within your company or industry. But that doesn't mean you should stop there. The better you do at work, the more opportunity you'll have to grow your income and use that additional money to fund your nest egg.\\n\\nSo, rather than coast through the next decade or so at work, strive to keep learning. Take courses to boost your skills, and network extensively so that when higher-level positions open up, your name will come to mind. Incidentally, increasing your salary will also drive up your Social Security benefits, since they're based on your earnings record. And that will help provide a bit more income in retirement as well.\\n\\nRelated links:\\n\\n\\u2022 Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\\n\\n\\u2022 This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\\n\\n\\u2022 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\\n\\nIf you've been slacking on the retirement savings front, your 40s are the perfect time to get your act together.

Make it $1,000 a month, and you'll be sitting on almost $500,000.

It makes assumptions about your investment mix\\n\\nThe 4% rule is designed for portfolios with a relatively equal mix of stocks and bonds -- specifically, 60% stocks and 40% bonds. And while there's a little wiggle room in that formula, if your risk tolerance is such that your investments are heavily skewed toward one option over the other, it could throw everything off.\\n\\nFor example, if you're the risk-averse type and have 80% of your portfolio in bonds, you won't see the same level of growth as someone with a more stock-heavy investment mix. On the flip side, if you're an aggressive investor with 90% of your assets in stocks, you'll probably see more rapid growth, but you'll also be exposed to a greater degree of market volatility, which could put your savings' sustainability at risk if you're forced to take withdrawals during downturns.\\n\\nOf course, this isn't to say that you should adjust your investments to align with the 4% rule's assumptions. Ultimately, you're better off sticking to a mix that suits your risk tolerance level and goals. Just be aware, however, that if your portfolio looks nothing like that 60%/40% split, the 4% rule may not work for you.\\n\\n2. It's outdated\\n\\nWe just learned that the 4% rule assumes a relatively healthy mix of stocks and bonds. But the rule was also developed during the mid-1990s, at which point bond interest rates were significantly higher than what they've been for the past number of years.\\n\\nIn other words, bonds can't generate the same sort of growth today that they could in years past, which calls the rule's formula into question. And given that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times last year alone, we might see bond values begin to drop even lower.\\n\\n3. It might cause you to sell your retirement lifestyle short\\n\\nThe 4% rule is designed to make your retirement savings last for 30 years. But some of us may not need three full decades' worth of retirement income, especially given the number of people who are working longer these days.\\n\\nDuring the first half of 2017, 19% of 70- to 74-year-olds were still employed. That's roughly 8% more than the number of employed adults in that age group back in the mid-1990s, when the rule was first introduced. And while it's always nice to be optimistic, the fact of the matter is that only about 10% of U.S. seniors will end up living until 95 -- so it's safe to say that if you work until your mid-70s, you can plan for a much shorter retirement.\\n\\nNow you might be thinking: \\\"Why not just follow the 4% rule anyway and play it safe?\\\" The problem, however, is that by doing so, you could end up depriving yourself of certain luxuries you've worked hard for and deserve to enjoy as a senior.\\n\\nA better way to use the 4% rule\\n\\nThough the 4% rule has some flaws, it's still a pretty good starting point to work with as far as retirement planning goes. So rather than regard it as gospel, use it as a general means of assessing your savings level. For example, if you determine that you'll need $60,000 a year to live comfortably in retirement, of which $16,000 will come from Social Security, you'll be left with an annual $44,000 gap to fill. Using the 4% rule, we can multiply $44,000 by 25 to arrive at a $1.1 million nest egg, which is what you might aim for during your working years.\\n\\nRelated links:\\n\\n\\u2022 Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\\n\\n\\u2022 This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\\n\\n\\u2022 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\\n\\nFurthermore, while a yearly 4% withdrawal rate may not be ideal for you, it should give you a general ballpark of what to expect. Most folks can't get away with removing 10% of their savings year after year, but sticking to a mere 2% withdrawal rate may not be necessary, either. The beauty of the 4% rule is that despite its drawbacks, it gives us a benchmark to work with. And that's something most of us can use.\"}{\"id\": 54, \"name\": \"Best Mortgage Program in US History to End\", \"url\": \"https://ck.lendingtree.com/?a=343&c=2538&p=r&s1=partnerbin&ctype=hppaidpartner&cmethod=harp&ccreative=forgetyour401k\", \"timestamp\": \"\", \"description\": \"\", \"keywords\": [\"history\", \"way\", \"mortgage\", \"best\", \"good\", \"end\", \"say\", \"harp\", \"refinance\", \"savings\", \"opportunity\", \"qualify\", \"program\"], \"summary\": \"Best Mortgage Program in US History to EndThe final days of the shockingly generous government refinance program called HARP are upon us.\\nHARP (Home Affordable Refinance Program) is a refinancing program launched by the US government under the Obama administration.\\nBut as they say, all good things must come to an end.\\nThe Best Refinance Opportunity of This DecadeTo put this opportunity into perspective we compared HARP savings to the savings of a 401k.\\nThe HARP program saves the average American $2,400 per year but ends in December of 2018 so it's essential to take action now.\", \"content\": \"Best Mortgage Program in US History to End\\n\\nThe final days of the shockingly generous government refinance program called HARP are upon us.

Michael Capuano in the Democratic primary for a seat that has been held by the likes of John F. Kennedy and Tip O'Neill in the past.\\n\\nPressley ran as an unapologetic liberal, calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump and the abolishing of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was endorsed by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- the only other challenger to beat a Democratic House incumbent so far in 2018 -- and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a rising national star among liberals.\\n\\nIn short, Pressley's win had all the hallmarks of Ocasio-Cortez's victory over the summer -- a liberal insurgent candidate catches a more moderate, establishment member of Congress off-guard. Except that's not what happened here. At all.\\n\\nStart with the fact that Capuano is no one's idea of a moderate. According to VoteView ratings , Capuano is the 15th most liberal member of Congress -- and the most liberal member of the not-very-conservative Massachusetts delegation. That makes him more liberal than Nancy Pelosi (32nd) and close to as liberal as Maxine Waters (4th). Compare that to Rep. Joe Crowley, the Democrat that Ocasio-Cortez beat. Crowley was the 78th most liberal member, according to VoteView\\n\\nSo if Capuano didn't lose because he wasn't liberal enough, why did he lose? Two reasons.\\n\\n1. Tone\\n\\nThis primary didn't turn on the incumbent member of Congress voting in ways that were inconsistent with the wants and needs of his district. It was about what kind of liberalism voters in the Boston-area district wanted. Capuano's was a quiet liberalism; he always voted the right way for a district where Hillary Clinton won 83% of the vote in 2016, but he wasn't an activist. He wasn't demanding change. He wasn't storming the barricades. That was the sort of liberalism that Pressley promised. \\\"This district and these times demand more than just an ally, they demand an advocate and a champion,\\\" she said in announcing her candidacy . \\\"Making progress on longstanding challenges requires a different lens and a new approach.\\\"\\n\\nIn the wake of Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016, many liberals concluded that while the former secretary of state was with them on issues, she was too tonally moderate -- unwilling to talk about things like single-payer health care, for instance, for fear of alienating voters in the ideological middle. Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and newly minted Florida governor nominee Andrew Gillum are all liberals on the more activist end of the spectrum -- a reflection of what the Democratic Party base wants right now.\\n\\nOne example that illustrates the tonal difference between Capuano and Pressley: Trump impeachment. Capuano spent much of 2017 urging caution for Democrats who wanted articles of impeachment brought against Trump. \\\"We have to respect the process,\\\" the Boston Globe quoted Capuano writing in a May 2017 newsletter . \\\"It shouldn't be a witch hunt or a political statement.\\\" While Capuano eventually came around and voted for a measure that would have begun the impeachment process against Trump, he was dogged by the idea he was only doing so out of reaction to Pressley's challenge. Of Trump's impeachment, Pressley said : \\\"I'd cast that vote, but a vote is not enough. As leaders we have to ask ourselves as we navigate this new and dangerous terrain together -- how do we resist and progress at the same time?\\\"\\n\\n2. The Democratic Party's changing face\\n\\nBoston -- and the Democratic Party -- is in the midst of a massive transformation from a working class, largely white majority into a far more racially and ethnically diverse one. As the Almanac of American Politics notes , Boston was a 95% white city in 1950; it is now 25% black and 19% Hispanic. The Almanac also notes that Boston is now populated by \\\"young singles in rowhouse apartments, professionals in waterfront apartment towers and African-Americans in old triple-deckers.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Pressley bristled at the idea that she was running primarily as a black candidate, the fact that she was a young, African-American woman (Pressley is 44) and Capuano was an older white man (he is 66) was obvious. And rhetorically, Pressley pushed the idea that she was the new face of a new Boston -- not exactly a racial appeal, but one clearly aimed at suggesting that Capuano represented a Democratic Party that no longer exists.\\n\\n\\\"This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy,\\\" Pressley said in the campaign . \\\"This is a disruptive candidacy, a grassroots coalition. It is broad and diverse and deep. People of every walk of life.\\\"\\n\\nPressley's win -- as well as the victory of Ocasio-Cortez, a female Puerto Rican-American candidate -- speak to that more diverse coalition within the party. As Cook Political Report House editor David Wasserman noted in a tweet on Tuesday night\\n\\n\\\"The share of House Rs who are white men is 86% and rising.\\n\\n\\\"The share of House Dems who are white men is 41% and falling.\\\"\\n\\nMake no mistake: The energy of the Democratic Party is on the left. But it's not that simple. Democrats don't just want to nominate liberals. They want to nominate liberals who a) are ready to fight President Trump on literally everything and b) who look more like the new base of the Democratic Party.\\n\\nThose are the lessons of Ayanna Pressley's win that ambitious 2020 Democrats need to learn.\"}{\"id\": 58, \"name\": \"13 totally bananas moments from Donald Trump's phone call with Bob Woodward\", \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/trump-woodward-phone-call/index.html\", \"timestamp\": \"2018-09-04T00:00:00\", \"description\": \"Last month, President Donald Trump called The Washington Post's Bob Woodward.\", \"keywords\": [\"trumps\", \"white\", \"bananas\", \"13\", \"moments\", \"know\", \"president\", \"called\", \"graham\", \"totally\", \"book\", \"phone\", \"im\", \"woodward\", \"told\", \"bob\", \"trump\", \"donald\"], \"summary\": \"(CNN) Last month, President Donald Trump called The Washington Post's Bob Woodward .\\nTrump had heard Woodward was working on a book and called to ask why Woodward had never reached out to him.\\nWoodward told Trump he had repeatedly tried to reach him through official and unofficial channels and been rebuffed.\\nWoodward called him on it with a fact.\\n\\\"I mean, you do know I'm doing a great job for the country.\", \"content\": \"(CNN) Last month, President Donald Trump called The Washington Post's Bob Woodward . Trump had heard Woodward was working on a book and called to ask why Woodward had never reached out to him. Woodward told Trump he had repeatedly tried to reach him through official and unofficial channels and been rebuffed. He also informed the President that the book -- \\\"Fear: Trump in the White House\\\" -- was done (it comes out on September 11) and that Trump was too late.\\n\\nI picked out the most fascinating parts of the call. They're below.\\n\\n1. \\\"It's really too bad, because nobody told me about it, and I would've loved to have spoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair.\\\"\\n\\nTrump is right -- Woodward is fair -- but the President saying this on tape(!) makes what undoubtedly will be the White House's attempt to discredit Woodward that much tougher. Also, it becomes clear time and time again in this phone call that people -- including White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham -- did talk to Trump (or his scheduling team) about sitting down with Woodward, even if the President says he didn't know it.\\n\\n2. \\\"Madeleine is the key. She's the secret. Because she's the person....\\\"\\n\\nTrump is talking about Madeleine Westerhout , his personal assistant. And her being \\\"the key\\\" is no longer much of a secret.\\n\\n3. \\\"Well, a lot of them are afraid to come and talk, or -- you know, they are busy. I'm busy. But I don't mind talking to you. I would've spoken to you.\\\"\\n\\nThe President of the United States is acknowledging that many of his aides are afraid of him! That. Is. Nuts. Also, Trump reiterates here that he would have been more than happy to talk to Woodward.\\n\\n4. \\\"And I certainly don't mind talking to you, and I wish I could've spoken to you. But nobody called my office. I mean, you went through, I guess, different people. ...\\\"\\n\\nPut a pin in this. We'll come back to it.\\n\\n5. \\\"Who were the senators? No, they never called me about it. ... Senator Graham actually mentioned it quickly in one meeting.\\\"\\n\\nIn between Trump saying no senator mentioned it and him admitting Graham mentioned it comes this line from Woodward: \\\"Senator Graham said he had talked to you about talking to me. Now, is that not true?\\\" What happened is this: Trump made a sweeping statement. Woodward called him on it with a fact. Trump acknowledged his previous statement (seconds before) was inaccurate. Good times. (Also, see No. 4.)\\n\\n6. \\\"So I have another bad book coming out. Big deal.\\\"\\n\\nThis can be read either as false bravado (Trump is trying to convince Woodward that nothing can really hurt him with his supporters) or actual bravado (Trump is convinced that nothing can really hurt him with his supporters). I'm honestly not sure which it is.\\n\\n7. \\\"I mean, you do know I'm doing a great job for the country. You do know that NATO now is going to pay billions and billions of dollars more, as an example, than anybody thought possible, that other presidents were unable to get more?\\\"\\n\\nThis line from Trump comes DIRECTLY after Woodward describes the way in which he used sources and described meeting in the White House. It's almost as if Trump turned on some sort of autopilot function. Because in the context of the conversation, the decision to tout your work on NATO makes a total of 0% sense.\\n\\n8. \\\"Well, other than Lindsey [Graham], who did quickly mention it, nobody mentioned it.\\\"\\n\\nUm, no. Scroll down. (Also, see No. 4.)\\n\\n9. \\\"Nobody told me about it. Well, let me ask her. Why don't you speak to Kellyanne. Ask her. She never told me about it.\\\"\\n\\nTrump hands the phone to Conway at this point. (I told you this was an amazing phone call!) Conway, with Trump listening, says this: \\\"I put in the request. But you know, they -- it was rejected. I can only take it so far. I guess I can bring it right to the president next time.\\\" Then she adds: \\\"I try to follow all the protocols, or else I'm accused of being somebody who doesn't follow protocol.\\\" Conway's shade here at the team who handles Trump interview requests is truly epic. Look, I asked. They said no. Talk to them.\\n\\n10. \\\"If you would've called directly -- a lot of people are afraid ... Raj, I hardly have ... I don't speak to Raj.\\\"\\n\\nRaj Shah is the principal deputy communications director at the White House. He's running point for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. He's also likely had better days than today.\\n\\n11. \\\"She should've come to me. She does have access to me. Absolutely. She has direct access, but she didn't come to me.\\\"\\n\\nThat thud was Trump pushing Conway under the bus while on a taped phone conversation with a political reporter.\\n\\n12. \\\"I'm just hearing about it. And I heard -- I did hear from Lindsey, but I'm just hearing about it. So we're going to have a very inaccurate book, and that's too bad. But I don't blame you entirely.\\\"\\n\\nHere's where you begin to see Trump formulating what will be his spin about \\\"Fear.\\\" I didn't even know about the book. Some of my aides didn't tell me. So the book is wrong. The problem there is a) Woodward has a long track record of getting it right and b) Trump casting himself as someone his aides are afraid to tell stuff to isn't a great look for him.\\n\\n13. \\\"Well, accurate is that nobody's ever done a better job than I'm doing as president.

Many impounded the scooters. Some levied fines.\\n\\nYet some cities are softening their stance as they realize scooters can play an integral role in easing congestion, reducing pollution, and bolstering public transit. And the startups, having watched companies such as Uber be penalized for antagonizing municipal governments, are willing to play nicely if it means expanding their market.\\n\\nAustin, Texas, offers a case in point. The city found itself inundated with Bird's sleek black scooters in April. Lime flooded the city with its bright green scooters a short time later.\\n\\n\\\"The human response would be, shake off the gloves and let's go. Let's fight this. You just disrupted my city,\\\" Jason JonMichael, assistant director of Austin's smart mobility program, told CNNMoney.\\n\\nInstead, city officials talked things over. As it happened, they'd been planning a dockless bikesharing program. Their plan called for eventually adding scooters to the mix, so they decided to work with the companies to make it happen, JonMichael said.\\n\\nRather than issue a cease and desist letter -- an approach some cities took -- Austin warned the companies that it would confiscate scooters blocking sidewalks. And city officials set to work crafting an ordinance governing a permitting process for scooter services, including speed restrictions and fees for operating.\\n\\nToday you'll find 2,000 scooters all over Austin. People love them so much -- each scooter is ridden nearly 20 times daily -- that their batteries often go dead by noon, JonMichael said. And it's making life better in the city, too. JonMichael said people are taking fewer solo trips in cars, which means less congestion and pollution.\\n\\nThe city reviews each company's performance every six months, reserving the right to revoke the license of anyone who isn't playing by the rules. That's got the startups working hard to stay in the city's good graces by offering discounted rides to low-income residents and developing tools that allow people to report bad behavior by anyone zipping along on a scooter.\\n\\nCity officials now see scooter and bikeshare firms as allies in their efforts to improve quality of life and expand transit options. The startups are \\\"bringing to the table discussions about developing a roadmap to deploy transportation that from the get-go has equity and access for all built into it,\\\" JonMicheal said.\\n\\nRelated: Could scooters become the new bikeshare?\\n\\nBird hopes to broker a similar alliance in its hometown of Santa Monica, California. The company launched in September 2017 and followed the ridesharing playbook that says it's better to seek forgiveness than permission. Bird launched without proper business licenses, and in February agreed to pay the city $300,000 in fines to settle a criminal complaint.\\n\\nDespite the trouble, Santa Monica officials wanted electric scooters to stay given their focus on multi-modal transportation and carbon-light living. The city gave Bird and Lime conditional permits while it worked to set up a 16-month pilot program. Earlier this month, the Santa Monica government ranked applicants to its scooter program, and Bird placed 10th.\\n\\n\\\"That was a real wake-up call. This is a fantastic business, and there's a lot of competitors who want to do it,\\\" Dave Estrada, the Chief Legal Officer at Bird told CNNMoney. \\\"It really helped us take a good look at how we were doing operations and how we can best serve cities.\\\"\\n\\nThat explains why Bird on Wednesday announced several concessions intended to curry favor with Santa Monica and other cities. It will let cities designate no-go areas where people can't ride or park scooters. It will grant cities the option to convey the rules of the road and other safety tips in messages users see before riding off. And it will share data that will help cities understand how people are using its scooters.\\n\\nBird went so far as to resubmit its Santa Monica application earlier this month, to be more appealing to the government. At the city's request, it has begun limiting the speed of its scooters to 5 mph on the beach path, and in Palisades Park, two areas that have been controversial. It also plans to send text alerts to riders who stray into areas where cities don't want scooters.\\n\\nA lingering challenge for the industry is sidewalk riding, which irritates many pedestrians. The scooter companies instruct customers to ride in bike lanes, but bike lanes are rare and sometimes customers still choose sidewalks. Bird is exploring ways to discourage sidewalk riding, by automatically detecting with sensors when a scooter is on a sidewalk.\\n\\nIt may not be popular with every rider, but the startup has realized that cities are its customers too.\\n\\n\\\"We started understanding that we had one customer, the rider,\\\" Estrada said. \\\"Now we really understand a lot better that customers include cities and people who don't ride Birds.\\\"\"}{\"id\": 64, \"name\": \"SoFi's had a rough year.

The company has faced lawsuits from former employees, including two that claim it failed to address endemic sexual harassment. In September, CEO and cofounder Mike Cagney abruptly resigned as criticism of SoFi's frat-house culture mounted.\\n\\nNow under the leadership of former Twitter executive Anthony Noto, the company wants to get back on track. It's close to the official launch of its new checking and savings account, SoFi Money. Noto has discussed getting into stock trading. And an IPO is on the table.\\n\\nYet issues tied to the old regime keep cropping up. SoFi is repeatedly asked to talk about how it changed its corporate culture. Last quarter, the company reported a loss to investors after it had to write down underperforming loans issued before Noto came on. It's not clear if the company will pursue a bank license again, after it withdrew its application last year.\\n\\n\\\"It's still trying to balance that rapid growth with something that's a little more responsible and a little more focused on being a viable and successful business longer term,\\\" said Robert Wildhack, an analyst at Autonomous Research.\\n\\nNoto says SoFi is working to build a strong company culture. An initiative called One SoFi pulls together employees from different teams, and has rolled out a set of core values.\\n\\nNew banking app\\n\\nA big test for Noto is his first product launch: SoFi Money, a digital bank account that touts no fees and 1% interest \\u2014 much higher than what most traditional banks pay on checking accounts.\\n\\n\\\"We give you all the liquidity of a checking account, with the higher interest of a savings account,\\\" Jennifer Delaney, SoFi's director of product management, told CNN.\\n\\nSoFi has more than 500,000 members, more than half of whom came to the company to refinance their student loans.\\n\\nBut that kind of lending doesn't really engage customers. People check in monthly when they pay what they owe, not daily. SoFi wants to change that dynamic with Money, which is in beta.\\n\\n\\\"The company started as a student refinancing business, which is naturally a one-time-only product,\\\" said Max Abramsky, an analyst at CB Insights. \\\"Now it is looking for ways to expand its offerings with products that consumers will be drawn to interacting with the brand on a more frequent basis.\\\"\\n\\nSoFi Money is integrated with other SoFi products, so customers can monitor both their assets and liabilities. It also comes with a debit card for spending and withdrawing cash.\\n\\nDigital banking has grown as savers have gotten more comfortable managing money from their phones. Competition in the space is getting stiff. Investment apps Stash and Acorns are in the process of launching their own products. Stash Banking provides financial coaching by monitoring users' spending. Acorns Spend links its debit card to a rewards program that invests cash back. Then there's Goldman Sachs (GS), which offers an online savings account with 1.85% interest though Marcus, its growing hub for online consumer products.\\n\\nSoFi hopes to stand out from the crowd by playing up its community appeal. Noto has referred to the debit card as a \\\"membership card,\\\" and it comes with a user's initials on the front. SoFi members get access to a suite of perks, including local community events and free career counseling. The company also says its technology will make transactions faster.\\n\\nSo far, 2,000 beta users have completed more than 20,000 transactions. If all goes well, SoFi Money will play a role in the company's expansion, especially as a conduit for new product recommendations.\\n\\n\\\"We'll use the data to help give them advice on discretionary spending, on savings and investing, and also borrowing,\\\" Noto said at the CB Insights conference in June.\\n\\nWhat's next?\\n\\nAs the company prepares for an IPO, which could come as soon as next year, it's also looking at the brokerage business.\\n\\nSoFi could soon let members buy individual stocks and cryptocurrencies through its wealth management platform, Noto told CNBC in July. It might even launch SoFi-branded ETFs.\\n\\nAdditionally, the startup is talking to banks about securing a $500 million to $1 billion line of credit, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Such a move could help fuel growth in advance of an IPO. The talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.\\n\\nBut the startup hasn't shaken past problems entirely.\\n\\nNoto has said building a positive corporate culture is \\\"a constant education process.\\\"\\n\\nAt least two lawsuits were filed last year by former employees who said the company's culture fostered sexual harassment. Another lawsuit claimed employees were not given proper rest periods or paid what was required by California law. The lawsuits have either been settled or settlements are being finalized, according to a person with knowledge.\\n\\nThen there's the question of whether the company will reapply for a bank license. It had to abandon its application last year after Cagney's departure, since the company didn't have a permanent CEO at the helm for several months. In December, SoFi announced it would partner with Delaware-based WSFS Bank to launch SoFi Money.\\n\\nSoFi also reported a $200 million loss last quarter because of writedowns of underperforming loans, Bloomberg reported earlier this month after obtaining a letter to shareholders. The loans were said to have been originated prior to the quarter, and reportedly were part of a decision to clean up the company's books under new leadership.\\n\\nAutonomous Research's Wildhack said the writedowns could be a red flag, since SoFi made its name with investors by focusing on \\\"really, really high-quality borrowers,\\\" such as graduates from Ivy League law and medical schools.\\n\\n\\\"Those are people that are making a lot of money right out of the gate,\\\" he said. \\\"Now their loans are underperforming?

That means bilingual families can request music, check the weather, control a smart lightbulb and do myriad other things in two tongues without having to change settings each time.\\n\\nThat was a difficult trick to accomplish, and Google Assistant is the first of the major voice assistants to pull it off. That could help Google woo users away from Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri.\\n\\nA bilingual digital assistant may seem like no big deal, but more than half the world speaks at least two languages, according to estimates. And studies suggest speaking multiple languages has a positive impact on children's brain development and social skills.\\n\\nAmazon has dominated the smart speaker market since creating the category in 2014. The Echo remains the most popular smart speaker in the United States, and two-thirds of the smart-speaker owners talk to Alexa at least once a month, according to eMarketer. Google Home sits firmly in second place with 30% of smart speaker users chatting up a Home each month.\\n\\nHowever, flagship smart speakers are but one part of the equation. The voice-based interfaces also run on third-party products like other speakers, in-car systems, and smartphones. Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system, offers Google Assistant, of course, and you can even access it on an iPhone through the Google iOS app.\\n\\nAmazon was the first to offer a smart speaker, but Google got the jump on voice recognition technology. It started transcribing voice mails and doing voice searches in 2009, while also making strides in neural networks. Google's also is investing in voice technology for other products, like its human-imitating Google Duplex phone automation tool.\\n\\nBilingual processing marks an important advancement in speech recognition technology, one that Google says it spent years developing, according to a blog post detailing the technical details behind the feature. The first step is being able to detect what language someone is speaking. Google started developing its language identification tool, LangID, in 2013. The system can discern the difference between 2000 pairs of languages, according to Google.\\n\\nTo ensure Assistant offers an immediate reply in the same language as a user's query, Google Assistant will run two speech recognition systems at once. Its goal is to determine which language you're speaking as quickly as possible so it can use less processing power. It weighs factors like your musical preferences, how frequently a language is used, and the type of device being used when deciding what language to choose.\\n\\nWhen it determines what language is being spoken, the Assistant switches to the regular monolingual process. By the time you've stopped saying, \\\"OK Google, turn the Nest to 76 degrees,\\\" it should already know what language you were speaking, what you said, and have begun sending instructions to the thermostat.\\n\\nThe new feature rolls out beginning Thursday. To get started, you must select a second language in settings. It supports English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Japanese to start, which Google says will cover most of its users who speak multiple languages. It plans on adding more languages are coming later this year.\\n\\nGoogle Assistant still won't be able to parse single commands that combine two languages, though. Each request needs to be entirely in one language.\\n\\nGoogle says support for multiple languages has been a highly requested feature, and that it's not stopping with just two. The company already is working on understanding three or more languages simultaneously.\\n\\nAmazon declined to say whether it is developing a similar feature.\\n\\nBonne chance, Alexa.\"}{\"id\": 66, \"name\": \"Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand hit with penalties for 'unsubstantiated claims'\", \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/health/goop-fine-california-gwyneth-paltrow/index.html\", \"timestamp\": \"2018-09-05T00:00:00\", \"description\": \"Actress Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand, Goop, has been slapped with penalties for \\\"unsubstantiated claims.\\\" The products that spawned the charges?

People who do not meet this guideline are at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease dementia and some cancers , research shows.\\n\\nThe trend of insufficient physical activity levels worldwide is getting worse, not better, the new study published Tuesday in the journal Lancet Global Health reveals. More than a quarter of all adults -- 1.4 billion people worldwide -- were inadequately active in 2016, compared with 23.3% in 2010.\\n\\nIn fact, no improvement has been seen in worldwide levels of exercise since 2001, the report indicates, with high-income countries showing a 5% increase in inactivity levels between 2001 and 2016.\\n\\n\\\"Levels of inactivity are more than twice as high in high income countries as compared to low income countries, with an increasing trend in high income countries,\\\" lead study author Regina Guthold of WHO wrote in an email. \\\"Latin America and the Caribbean, and high-income Western countries are the two regions with the highest levels of inactivity, and with increasing trends in inactivity.\\\"\\n\\nThe sedentary lifestyle\\n\\nThe new study looked at 358 surveys that collected data on nearly 2 million people who reported their activity levels both at work and at home. Participants included people 18 and older in 168 countries, an increase over the previous WHO study from 2010 , which included only 146 countries.\\n\\nThe researchers made statistical adjustments to compare the newest estimates to those from all previous WHO studies. According to Guthold, the downward trend in physical activity found in the newest study cannot be explained by including more countries in the analysis.\\n\\nIn 2016, physical activity varied across income groups: Just 16% of people surveyed in low-income countries revealed an inadequate amount of exercise, compared with 37% in high-income countries. Uganda and Mozambique had the best records of exercising adults: Just 6% of adults in each of those countries did not do enough physical activity in 2016.\\n\\nWealthier countries have transitioned towards sedentary occupations, more recreation and motorized transport, and this could explain the higher levels of inactivity compared with lower-income countries where both work and transportation often require physical activity, the authors wrote. Declines in physical activity are inevitable as countries prosper and use of technology increases, they say.\\n\\nHowever, while Western countries showed a slight decrease in physical activity, the opposite happened in east and southeast Asian countries, which registered healthy gains in both their economies and their exercise levels between 2001 and 2016. That region registered 26% of adults with insufficient activity in 2001 yet just 17% in 2016. This is largely influenced by China, the authors stated, with leisure-time activity rising in the most populated country in the region, possibly through increased physical activity and use of public parks among its growing elderly population.\\n\\nA consistent gender gap in physical activity was found around the globe in 2016, excluding east and southeast Asia.\\n\\nMore women than men reported themselves to be insufficiently active, with a 10% or greater margin between the sexes in three regions: South Asia (43% of women inactive vs. 24% of men), Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa (40% vs. 26%), and high-income Western countries (42% vs. 31%).\\n\\nLarge differences between women and men existed in the United States (48% vs. 32%), the UK (40% vs. 32%), India (44% vs. 25%), the Philippines (49% vs. 30%), South Africa (47% vs. 29%) and Turkey (39% vs. 22%).\\n\\nAlthough the worldwide problem of inactivity is clear, the solutions are less so.\\n\\n'Small changes,' not gyms\\n\\nWalter R. Thompson, an associate dean and a professor of kinesiology and health at Georgia State University, said that the study's most important point is that \\\"physical inactivity is pandemic and not a characteristic of low-income or high-income countries.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is prevalent in every country and has the same impact on chronic disease,\\\" said Thompson, who was not involved in the study.\\n\\n\\\"WHO admits that the current strategies are not working and that new tactics are needed to improve increasing physical activity in all countries,\\\" added Thompson, who is also a past president of the American College of Sports Medicine. He noted that \\\"public policy has not changed physical activity patterns.\\\"\\n\\nIn the United States, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010 , 10-year target programs for improving the health of Americans. Both prioritized \\\"physical activity and fitness,\\\" yet there's been \\\"little to no change in the prevalence of physical activity,\\\" he said. \\\"Americans are just not getting enough exercise.\\n\\n\\\"We cannot just tell people that they need to exercise more; it does not work,\\\" Thompson said. \\\"Our work clearly shows that we need to demonstrate lifestyle modifications that can be adopted by most of the population and get away from sending people to gyms. Small changes in behavior, like parking your car in the last row instead of the first row at the grocery store or climbing stairs instead of the elevator, are just two examples.\\\"\\n\\nGuthold said that countries and communities alike can address descending levels of exercise by \\\"creating new opportunities and programs to support and engage people to be more active.\\\" She added that they can also improve environments so more people can walk, cycle or physically move in other ways.\\n\\nHowever, changing physical characteristics of a community may not be enough: Gregory Knell, a researcher at the University of Texas School of Public Health in Dallas, recently published a study on whether improving sidewalks might lead to more physical activity. The results suggested \\\"that improving sidewalks was not sufficient to increase physical activity among those who are inactive, whereas for those who are already active, living near improved sidewalks was associated with increases in reported leisure-time and walking activity.\\\"\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\n\\\"There is not one silver bullet to overcoming the physical inactivity epidemic,\\\" said Knell, who had no part in the new WHO study. \\\"Our cities, neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, entertainment venues and transportation systems have all been designed to promote physical inactivity.\\\" Avoiding exercise in all cases has become the \\\"more convenient and easier\\\" option.\\n\\n\\\"We need to turn this around and make physical activity as part of your daily life the easiest, most convenient approach,\\\" Knell said.\\n\\nGuthold said that people who are completely inactive can begin with a little exercise and then build up their weekly exercise time. \\\"Any activity is better than none, and more activity will provide greater health benefits,\\\" she said. \\\"It is often easier to be active in a group, with family or friends.\\\"\\n\\nThompson concluded that the new WHO report \\\"has global implications.

The cause of death was a massive stroke she suffered soon after the transplant surgery. She was 21.\\n\\n'Love what is'\\n\\nA quarter of Claire's life was spent in the hospital. The medical team that tended to her became family. She played hide-and-seek with nurses and left explosions of glitter in her wake. She watched one of her doctors squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk. She took great care to decorate her hospital room so it felt and looked like home.\\n\\nHer parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split up when Claire was 3, but they remained friends and partners in her care.\\n\\nHer father credits Claire with teaching him \\\"to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet\\\" and to learn to \\\"love what is.\\\"\\n\\nYeager, who lost and quit jobs as hospital stays dictated, always marveled at her daughter's aura and her ability to lift up those around her.\\n\\nIn 2017, Yeager recalled a conversation with Claire about death. At one point, Claire looked at her mom and said, \\\"After you die, you're closer to everyone you love because you're part of everything,\\\" Yeager remembered.\\n\\nThese words were a gift, a reminder that Claire would remain with her always, even after she was gone.\\n\\nTrusting Claire\\n\\nMore than 30,000 people in the United States, more than 70,000 worldwide, have cystic fibrosis, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . The median survival age is 40, the foundation reports, which is a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.\\n\\nClaire Wineland spent a quarter of her life in the hospital.\\n\\nThe genetic and progressive disease creates an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs. It also complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.\\n\\nThere is no cure, but dutiful breathing treatments -- which eat up hours each day -- can help with symptoms and complications. A double-lung transplant, when successful, can add years to a patient's life.\\n\\nClaire's parents learned to trust their independent and strong-willed daughter. When it came to her care, she knew her body best -- what worked for her, what didn't and how far she was willing to go.\\n\\nSo when she became a legal adult and told them she had no intention of getting a double-lung transplant, they had to accept her decision, even if it pained them.\\n\\n\\\"I had to be honest,\\\" she once explained. \\\"It's not for me and never has been.\\\"\\n\\nA change of heart\\n\\nClaire took the gift of life and her health seriously, but she didn't take herself too seriously. She once escaped from the hospital so she could attend a Bernie Sanders rally. She laughed at the absurdities that often swirled around her, including those moments in the produce aisle at Whole Foods when shoppers would prescribe her unsolicited \\\"cures,\\\" telling her to eat more pineapple or that a mushroom cleanse would take care of everything.\\n\\nClaire Wineland's greatest wish, her mother said, was that \\\"her foundation will live on, even in her absence.\\\"\\n\\nShe was of the mind that she would leave this world with the body she came in with. She'd travel, answer calls for speaking engagements and put energy into her foundation , which she set up at age 13 after coming out of a 16-day medically induced coma. She'd work on a book -- promising it wouldn't be \\\"another happy sick person book\\\" -- and appreciate the small things like swims in the ocean for as long as she was able.\\n\\nAt a TEDx talk she gave last year, Claire made a point of saying how cystic fibrosis helped give her a quality of life.\\n\\n\\\"Life isn't just about being happy. ... It's not about how you feel second to second,\\\" she said. \\\"It's about what you're making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you've given.\\\"\\n\\nClaire had a change of heart about transplant earlier this year, prompted by a steep decline in her health that robbed her of the energy and ability to do what gave her joy and purpose. She wasn't done contributing. It was a welcome, albeit terrifying, development for those who loved her.\\n\\nTo get on the list for new lungs, she had to be sick enough to need them, yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery. Some people worried that she'd waited too long and wouldn't be given the chance at continued life.\\n\\nBut Claire took on the evaluation process to get on the list with laser focus. She sat in an educational meeting at UC San Diego Health's transplant center and diligently took notes.\\n\\nRevealed on her left ankle was a tattoo: the thumbs-up \\\"Don't Panic\\\" logo from \\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\\"\\n\\nShe listened to the risks and the long list of side effects and emerged unfazed.\\n\\n\\\"None of it spooked me,\\\" Claire said afterward. \\\"Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do ... I'm willing to deal with anything.\\\"\\n\\n'It's a GO!!!'\\n\\nIn late May, she made the list and shared the exciting news with her social media followers who dot the globe. But then, a mix of health and life complications took a toll and knocked her off the list, temporarily. By mid-August, she was back on and feeling ready.\\n\\nClaire and her mother beamed in a photo posted on social media after they learned her transplant was a go.\\n\\nShe'd worked hard to get there, was focused on her self-care and getting stronger. She joked that the squats she was doing, upon doctor's orders, would help get her more than lungs. She'd also get a butt.\\n\\nShe knew that the call could come at any minute, and on August 26, it did.\\n\\n\\\"It's a GO!!!\\\" she posted on Twitter, not long before she was wheeled into the operating room in San Diego. \\\"See y'all on [the] other side.\\\"\\n\\nThe nine-hour surgery went well, and her mother reported that the lungs were working great. Yeager posted a video of herself doing a happy dance with friends in the waiting room.\\n\\nBut not long after the successful surgery, hope turned to fear. Claire suffered a stroke when a blood clot cut off blood flow to the right side of her brain. She never emerged from her medically induced coma. Despite emergency surgeries, and what her mother described as \\\"Herculean efforts\\\" to try to save her, the daughter she knew was gone. Given the severity of the stroke and Claire's advance directive, it became clear that it was time to let her go. She passed away peacefully, with her parents by her side.\\n\\n\\\"They saw her into this world for her first breath and were with her for her last,\\\" Laura McHolm, the board chair for Claire's foundation, wrote in a Facebook post.\\n\\nLess than 3% of lung transplant recipients have a stroke between the surgery and hospital discharge, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which operates the nation's organ transplant system.\\n\\nClaire, who understood the importance of organ donation, was a donor herself. On Monday afternoon, her mother received word that Claire had already made a difference.\\n\\n\\\"Claire was able to save the life of two people, her right kidney was transplanted to a 44 year old woman in San Diego, and her left kidney was transplanted to a 55 year old male in Northern California. Also, Claire's corneas and tissue was recovered and she will be able to enhance the life of up to 50 people,\\\" a family services specialist wrote to Yeager in an email message. \\\"Claire's gift is huge, I want your family to know that your daughter is a hero.\\\"\\n\\nThe family intends to honor her memory by continuing to advance Claire's Place Foundation , which she established to financially support others affected by her lifelong disease.\\n\\n'Go enjoy it'\\n\\nIn one of the last videos Claire posted, she went where she hadn't before.\\n\\nA self-described \\\"goofball,\\\" she usually engaged people with humor and optimism. This time, she was raw and allowed herself to cry. As she faced the prospect of getting a double-lung transplant, she understood how desperate she was to live -- and give -- more.\\n\\n\\\"It hurts everything inside of me to make this video,\\\" she said into the camera. \\\"I didn't realize how much I didn't expect to live this long. I didn't expect to have a chance. ... The years of telling myself I can do it on my own are over.\\\"\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nShe had plenty of emotional support, but she worried what transplant surgery might mean for her future and her parents' future if it didn't go well. What if they poured everything into her transplant, and she didn't make it or was not able to work again, she explained later. She needed financial help. By asking for it, she said, she could relax and get in the headspace for whatever would come next.\\n\\nBefore signing off, Claire implored viewers to do one thing.\\n\\n\\\"Go enjoy your life. Really. I mean that seriously,\\\" she said with her signature smile and laugh, her eyes not yet dry. \\\"Go enjoy it, 'cause there are people fighting like hell for it.\\\"\"}"
