That would actually be a good story.\"\n\nIn a typical line of attack as Trump campaigns for Republicans ahead of this year's midterms, Trump said Democrats are the party of \"anger and hate.\" He blasted Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who is up for re-election this year, for releasing allegations that derailed the nomination of Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson , Trump's onetime personal White House physician, who was considered for veterans affairs secretary.\n\nTrump also lashed out at Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for their aggressive questioning this week of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh . Trump said committee members were \"attacking Judge Kavanaugh and looking like fools.\"\n\n\"And one of them will most likely be a candidate to run against your favorite-of-all-time president -- me,\" he said. It was not clear whether Trump was referring to New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker or California Sen. Kamala Harris, both possible presidential candidates.\n\nMontana is one of five states that Trump won by double digits in 2016 where a Democratic senator is up for re-election this fall -- which the White House and Republican strategists hope will give the President outsized influence on their Senate races.\n\nIn his second visit to Montana to campaign for state auditor Matt Rosendale, who is running against Tester in November's midterm elections, Trump attacked Tester for making public the allegations against Jackson, who withdrew his nomination.\n\n\"What Tester did to Adm. Jackson should never, ever be allowed. Ronny Jackson is a great man. Ronny Jackson has led a great and beautiful life\" and had \"lies told about him,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also warned that Democrats, if they win a majority in November's midterm elections, could impeach him. And if they did so, he said, the county \"is going to turn into a third world country, because if the opposite party becomes president, before it even starts, before you've even found out whether or not he or she is going to do a great job.\"\n\n\"So let's say a Democrat gets elected someday -- hopefully it's a long time. But let's say a Democrat gets elected, and let's say we have a Republican House -- we will impeach that Democrat. Right? And then a Republican,\" Trump said.\n\nVoting for party control of Congress, Trump said, is \"a very important thing.\"\n\nAnd if Democrats do pursue Trump's impeachment, he told the crowd, \"it's your fault because you didn't go out to vote.\"\n\nTrump's rallies often veer far from the topic of the Senate race he's there to weigh in on. In his July visit, Trump mocked the #MeToo movement, called Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren \"Pocahontas,\" claimed California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters' I.Q. is in the \"mid-60s\" and ridiculed Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who died nearly two weeks ago, for opposing his Obamacare repeal effort.\n\nOn Thursday night, he compared himself to Abraham Lincoln, saying the Gettysburg address -- one of the most famous speeches in American history -- was panned at the time, and that he believes his own presidency will similarly be viewed in a more positive light historically.\n\n\"I have a feeling that's going to happen with us. In different ways, that's going to happen with us,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump made his typical claims that Democrats will roll back Second Amendment rights and favor open borders. He attacked Tester for opposing legislation to ban sanctuary cities.\n\nMontana has long voted Republican in presidential elections, but Trump proved even more popular than other recent Republican presidential nominees. He won the state in 2016 by 21 percentage points -- a larger margin than Mitt Romney's 14 points in 2012 and McCain's 2 points in 2008.\n\nTester has largely opposed Trump's agenda. Of the five Democrats up for re-election in deep-red states, Tester and Missouri's Claire McCaskill voted against Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court confirmation in 2017, while the others -- Indiana's Joe Donnelly, North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia's Joe Manchin -- backed Gorsuch.\n\nIn a fundraising email to supporters Thursday morning, Tester highlighted Trump's visit to the state.\n\n\"Earlier this year, Trump said I'd 'have a big price to pay' this November -- which means he's ready to do whatever it takes to defeat me.

The truth is all the denials bring us no closer to finding out who actually wrote the piece. ( I speculated about 13 possible culprits here .)\n\nBut if you are a newspaper/sourcing nerd -- and I am! -- there is something that can be gained by a) digging into the way that the Times described the writer and b) understanding the Times' calculus in publishing the piece at all.\n\nThe writer was described by the Times as a \"senior official in the Trump administration,\" which is, obviously, very, very broad. There are thousands of people within the federal bureaucracy and God knows everyone thinks they are a senior official, too. (If there is anyone below you on the totem pole, they would be a junior administration official, so you could tell yourself you are a senior administration official.)\n\nThe other complicating factor, as noted by CNN's own Betsy Klein , is that there is no title of \"senior administration official\" within the federal government. Describing someone with that moniker is a function of an agreement between the media organization and the source. The relative senior-ness of the administration official is in the eye of the beholder -- a beholder named The New York Times, in this case.\n\n\"All I can say is I feel that we follow a definition that's been used by our newsroom in the past,\" said Jim Dao, the Times op-ed editor, in a conversation on \"The Daily\" podcast Thursday.\n\nWhere does that leave us? Almost nowhere. Except that you have to know this about The New York Times: They aren't publishing an anonymous op-ed from just anyone in the Trump administration. They especially aren't publishing one that alleges a near-coup within the federal government among people concerned the President is not only hopelessly out of his depth but also clueless about how hopelessly out of his depth he actually is.\n\nIn short: If some midlevel bureaucrat in the Trump administration comes to the Times -- or has an intermediary reach out to the Times -- asking to write a piece like this one without their name attached to it, the answer would be an immediate \"no.\" Contrary to what Trump says on his Twitter feed, media organizations are very wary of giving anyone and everyone anonymity to make attacks. Reporters push sources to put their names on quotes or at a minimum to narrow the anonymous descriptions to show as much of who these people are (and why they are saying what they are saying) as possible to the reader. Media organizations -- the credible ones at least -- are hugely averse to letting people take potshots without their names attached to it.\n\nGiven all of that, it's telling that the Times was willing to extend the cloak of anonymity to this author -- especially, again, because of the stakes and the target. This is not a decision made lightly. That the decision was made to publish it should tell you that this isn't some disgruntled mid-to-upper manager buried in the bureaucracy. This is a genuine high-ranking official. A name most people who follow politics -- and maybe some who don't -- would recognize. The Times simply wouldn't do what it did for anything short of a major figure in Trump world."}{"id": 4, "name": "Corker on NYT op-ed: Who wouldn't write it?", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/06/corker-reax-nty-oped-trump-gop-lead-sot-vxp.cnn", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "Sen.

Here's what they mean and why they're so relevant.\n\nSenior administration official\n\nThe anonymous author is identified only as a \"senior official in the Trump administration.\" But what exactly does that mean?\n\nAs CNN's Brian Stelter points out , many officials can be considered senior in the Trump administration, even if they don't work directly with the president.\n\nCNN's Chris Cillizza says the description used by the Times is broad enough to include virtually anyone in the Trump White House, a Cabinet official, undersecretary or someone on, say, the National Security Council.\n\nOn the NYT podcast The Daily, op-ed page editor Jim Dao declined to define the \"senior\" phrase further.\n\n\"All I can say is I feel that we followed a definition that has been used by our newsroom in the past,\" he said.\n\nOp-ed\n\nOp-ed is technically an abbreviation of \"opposite\" and \"editorial\" because such columns traditionally appear opposite the editorial page in a newspaper. But in general, op-ed is shorthand for opinion columns, commentaries or other authored features.\n\nThe NYT piece from the anonymous senior administration official was defined in an editor's note as an \"anonymous Op-Ed essay.\" Because of that, Merriam-Webster said \"op-ed\" was one of its top word searches Wednesday in the wake of its publication.\n\nLodestar\n\nThe term refers to a star in the night sky that provides guidance, such as the North Star. The distinctive word appears near the end of the Times' op-ed in discussing the moral leadership of the late Sen. John McCain.\n\n\"We may no longer have Senator McCain. But we will always have his example \u2014 a lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue,\" the anonymous author writes.\n\nSleuths have honed in on the rarely used word as a possible clue to the author's identity. For example, Panoply Media's Dan Bloom pointed out in a Twitter thread that Vice President Mike Pence has used \"lodestar\" a number of times in speeches.\n\nPence's deputy chief of staff and communications director Jarrod Agen denied Thursday that Pence or anyone from his office authored the op-ed.\n\nDeep state\n\nThe \"deep state\" is a political phrase that President Trump and his allies have used to describe what they see as an entrenched government bureaucracy that is quietly but actively working to undermine the president.\n\nIn the New York Times op-ed, the author wrote that \"unsung heroes\" in and around the White House have held Trump's worst inclinations in check. For example, although Trump had expressed frustration that the US imposed sanctions on Russia, the national security team knew such actions had to be done, the author wrote.\n\n\"This isn't the work of the so-called deep state. It's the work of the steady state,\" the author wrote.\n\n\"So, if there is a movement, which this individual claims there is and I haven't seen it, that is what the deep state is,\" Lewandowski said. \"That is the government employees -- some of them, who have their own agenda and not the agenda of the 60 million people that voted for Donald Trump to be the President of the United States.\"\n\n25th Amendment\n\nThe 25th Amendment lays out rules surrounding presidential succession in case of a president's death or disability. The amendment was adopted in 1967 in the wake of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nSection 4 of the amendment lays out what happens if the vice president and a majority of Cabinet members believe the president \"is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\" Essentially, following a deliberative process, the president is forced from office and the vice president becomes president.\n\nJUST WATCHED What the 25th amendment could mean for Trump Replay More Videos ...

View more opinion articles on CNN.com.\n\n(CNN) What do you do when your boss is dangerously unstable, often clueless and, oh yes ... the President of the United States?\n\nOne senior administration official resolved that question Wednesday by unburdening himself -- or herself -- on the op-ed page of The New York Times, describing a \"resistance\" within the upper echelons of the Trump administration that has acted to protect the country from an unmoored President.\n\nThe author suggested that Trump-appointed Cabinet members even discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment, declaring him unfit and removing him from office. Instead, the author said, they resolved to rein in the volcanic President from the inside.\n\nThe timing of the piece, coming a day after excerpts were released from Bob Woodward's new investigative tome, \"Fear: Trump in the White House,\" deepened the portrait of an ignorant and amoral President whose escalator isn't stopping at every floor.\n\nThe question I keep asking is: What exactly was its intended purpose?\n\nWas it to embolden a GOP-led Congress, currently in the President's thrall, to provide greater oversight?\n\nWas it to warn voters that he's an erratic and dangerous dolt in advance of the critical midterm elections, with the expectation that a Democratic Congress will provide the oversight the Republicans have not?\n\nWas this merely the work of someone who, after nearly two years in the White House of Horrors, felt the need to unburden himself -- or herself -- and bear witness to the disturbing things they had seen.\n\nOr was it meant to defend the honor of those, like the author, who have decided to stay, despite deep misgivings and fears about the President? This, it seems, is the most logical and understandable explanation for taking this extraordinary step.\n\nBut if your resolve is to stay inside and quietly work to help rein in Trump's excesses, wouldn't it have been more effective to suffer in silence a while longer rather than poking an already raging bear?\n\nThe essay predictably infuriated Trump and his supporters. \"TREASON?\" the President thundered through his favorite medium, as his aides launched their own witch hunt to identify the offender in their midst. (Good luck with that. Like \"Murder on the Orient Express,\" the list of suspects is voluminous.)\n\nThe President also hurled yet another assault at one of his favorite targets, the Times, for publishing the piece, going so far as to suggest the renegade author was the paper's fictitious invention.\n\nOf course, the Times editors know the identity of the author and, as with any unnamed source, ran the piece only after judging him or her credible.

Most important, there will be a reckoning at the polls this November and two years from now. An act of the Cabinet behind closed doors to decommission Trump -- if this was truly considered -- would have been greeted by his supporters as a bloodless coup.

He declined to agree to Democratic calls for him to recuse himself from any cases related to the Russia investigation. And he would not say where he would come down on abortion, amid expectations among conservatives he would like to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut Democrats did not walk away from a deeply divisive hearing with nothing. Top lawmakers showed vigor in cross examining Kavanaugh and by portraying him as Trump's man on the court and may have at least partly lived up to expectations of the party's fired up base for a show of backbone ahead of the mid-term elections.\n\nAfter emerging largely unscathed after the final round of questions from senators that stretched late into Thursday evening, Kavanaugh could take comfort in passing his biggest test. If Republicans stick together he is almost certain to be confirmed while minority Democrats face their own challenge in keeping the votes of red state senators with tough re-election races in their column.\n\nBooker's document fight\n\nThursday's hearing featured another bitter showdown between Democrats who are furious at the failure of the White House to hand over tens of thousands of key documents on time or at all, and at restrictions on the public release of material that was made available.\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Cory Booker said he was ready to risk expulsion from the Senate for making public documents pertinent Kavanaugh's time as a top White House aide to President George W. Bush, but the GOP mocked him for grandstanding ahead of a possible 2020 run -- saying it had already cleared the emails for release.\n\nIn a striking political gambit, Booker, backed up by Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, released emails -- which had been designated as \"committee confidential\" -- that reference Kavanaugh's position on racial profiling and thoughts on Roe v. Wade dating from his time as a White House official under Bush.\n\nBooker, who as a potential 2020 presidential candidate had an incentive to make a splash in the hearing, said he took the action as an act of \"civil disobedience.\"\n\n\"I understand the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. ... I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now,\" Booker said.\n\n\"This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment,\" he added.\n\nRepublican Sen John Cornyn warned Booker that releasing documents marked \"committee confidential\" would break Senate rules.\n\n\"Running for president is not an excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\" the Texas Republican said.\n\nLater Thursday, Bill Burck, a lawyer who oversaw the process of providing Bush administration documents, undercut Booker's grand gesture, saying that the material in question had been cleared on Wednesday night at the request of the senator's staff.\n\n\"We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public,\" Burck said in a statement.\n\nThe office of Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, also said that senators, including Booker, were notified \"before they spoke today\" that the restrictions on the documents had been waived.\n\nBooker, however, insisted he was in the right, saying he read from the documents aloud in the hearing on Wednesday night long before they were cleared at around 4 a.m. Democrats have repeatedly complained that the White House is withholding tens of thousands of documents relevant to the nomination and wants many more that have been provided released to the public.\n\nThe New Jersey senator also said he doubted Cornyn would follow through on his threats to enforce Senate discipline against him.\n\n\"I think he's like a lot of bullies are: a lot of talk, no action,\" Booker said.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis took exception to his Democratic colleague's tactics.\n\n\"Certainly in the six hours between the time that email hit your email box and the theatrics that happened in this chamber today you could have actually found out that you didn't have to be Spartacus, you didn't have to go interact with civil disobedience, you got what you wanted,\" Tillis said.\n\nThe schoolyard taunts underlined how the hearing, ahead of what appears to be Kavanaugh's likely confirmation, has become another battlefield in the vicious partisanship and complete lack of trust between the parties that is wracking Washington at a critical moment of the Trump era\n\nBooker's intervention followed a set of glowing reviews from liberals for another potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who late Wednesday night appeared to discomfort Kavanaugh with a series of questions designed to find out with whom he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nHarris returned to the question on Thursday evening, saying that she had been working on \"reliable information\" that Kavanaugh had a conversation about the probe with someone from Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz.\n\nKavanaugh had sidestepped the question on Wednesday, so Harris asked him again and he replied \"the answer's no.\"\n\nEarlier, the firm said in a statement to CNN there had been no such discussions.\n\nHarris did not disclose the \"reliable information\" on which she based her questions.\n\nJUST WATCHED Senator challenges Kavanaugh on Mueller probe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator challenges Kavanaugh on Mueller probe 02:55\n\n2003 email shows Kavanaugh discussing Roe\n\nIn another flashpoint development, a previously unreleased 2003 email from Kavanaugh, while he was an official in the Bush White House, shows him raising the point of whether Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right to an abortion, was settled law of the land.\n\nIn the internal White House email, obtained by CNN, Kavanaugh wrote: \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\"\n\n\"The point there is in the inferior court point,\" Kavanaugh wrote, responding to a draft op-ed that had been circulated for edits between lawmakers and White House staff.\n\nThe draft, meant to be submitted under the name of \"high-profile, pro-choice\" women in support of a Bush judicial nominee, had said that \"it is widely understood accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\"\n\nDuring the confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Kavanaugh said: \"As a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade.\"\n\nTrump said during his campaign that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. In recent years, Supreme Court nominees have gotten through their confirmation hearings by refusing to say how they would rule on what they say is a hypothetical future case on the issue.\n\nThe New York Times first reported the email.\n\nThroughout the contentious hearing, now in its third day, Kavanaugh has tried to give political questions -- especially those related to Trump and his potential legal woes -- a wide berth.\n\nOn Wednesday he insisted that \"no one is above the law\" but declined to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena.\n\nSenate Democrats have suggested that Kavanaugh could be biased in favor of the President and worry that his views on the primacy of executive power could help Trump evade legal scrutiny.\n\nBooker warned that given Trump's frequent attacks on the Justice Department there was a \"shadow over the independence of the judiciary\" and said it was understandable for some Americans to wonder whether a nominee picked by the President would owe loyalty to him or had been nominated to shield him from a criminal investigation.\n\n\"My only loyalty is to the Constitution,\" Kavanaugh responded. \"I have made that clear, I am an independent judge.\""}{"id": 13, "name": "Kavanaugh won't condemn Trump's Ginsburg tweets", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/06/blumenthal-kavanaugh-trump-tweets-ginsburg-bts-vpx.cnn", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "Sen.

Tom Carper fended off a spirited -- but perhaps fatally underfunded -- primary challenge from the left by first-time candidate Kerri Evelyn Harris, CNN projects.\n\nThe governor for eight years before entering the Senate in 2001, and the state's lone US House representative for a decade before that, Carper began his run in statewide office, as treasurer, in 1977. After former Vice President Joe Biden, who endorsed him two weeks ago, Carper is probably Delaware's best-known political figure. A loss to Harris would have been the first of his long career.\n\nCarper's Senate seniority and decades of experience were as much a burden as a selling point in the race, which kicked off in earnest earlier this year when Harris, a 38-year-old Air Force veteran and community organizer, entered pitching new blood and a different kind of politics. By almost any metric, ousting Carper would have been the Democratic left's most astonishing victory of the season, which helped Harris' cash-strapped campaign attract a late outside boost from the progressive Working Families Party.\n\nRespectful, per Delaware's exacting demands for politeness in the political arena, but firm in her criticism, Harris, who is biracial and gay, had sought to cast Carper, 71, as an out-of-touch centrist who, for all his good intentions, is disconnected from \"the urgency of now.\"\n\n\"We can't wait a little bit longer for a pay raise,\" Harris said in an interview on a searing hot Labor Day in Wilmington. \"We can't wait a little bit longer for health care that we can actually afford to use. We can't wait a little bit longer for our children to be properly educated or for our climate to be clean. These things are necessary and they have to happen now.\"\n\nThe Ocasio-Cortez connection\n\nBack in late June, Harris took a brief detour from her own efforts to stump alongside a little-known candidate in New York's 14th Congressional District named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . Both were running on platforms headlined by \"Medicare-for-all\" single payer health care, a $15 minimum wage, ending cash bail and a refusal to accept corporate political action committee donations.\n\nWhen Ocasio-Cortez won her primary, a handful of organizers from her team traveled south to join Harris' small, feisty operation. Last Friday, Ocasio-Cortez hosted a pair of town halls with Harris in Delaware.\n\n\"She had my back and I'm here to have hers,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in Newark, \"because that's how the progressive movement really works.\"\n\nBut the similarities between their contests were checked by Carper's relentless political retail work. Unlike New York's Rep. Joe Crowley, whom Ocasio-Cortez defeated, the three-term incumbent has over the years gone to great lengths, literally, to sustain his relationship with voters back home. He commutes almost daily from Wilmington to Washington, DC, and frequently touts the 482,000 miles he's put on his Chrysler minivan \"traveling up and down the state.\"\n\nCarper and his supporters had been quick to underline the differences between him and Crowley, a Queens Democrat with a home in Virginia who Ocasio-Cortez cuttingly alluded to in her viral campaign ad as someone who \"doesn't send his kids to our schools, doesn't drink our water or breathe our air.\" They had also gently, but consistently over the last couple of days, sought to portray the Harris campaign as a front for out-of-state progressives.\n\n\"My gut tells me that they believe that Kerri is the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and they believe that I'm somehow the next Joe Crowley,\" Carper said in an interview at a Labor Day picnic in Wilmington. \"They think that Delaware is New York City. And I think they're mistaken on all three counts.\"\n\nSweat seeping through a green Navy flight suit, worn to honor the late Sen. John McCain, Carper -- now the Senate's only Vietnam veteran -- argued that voters in Delaware wanted two things he was uniquely positioned to provide: someone with the clout to shape compromise on Capitol Hill while also leveraging that power to \"stop Trump from ruining this country.\"\n\n\"Delaware's almost schizophrenic, and I think the country is too. They want us to stop Trump from doing more stupid and, in some cases, cruel things, at the same time they want us to try to find common ground on a number of other issues,\" he said, ultimately landing on an optimistic note: \"And I think you can do both. I think you can do both.\"\n\nTo say Harris offered a different view of the current landscape misunderstands, or at the least underestimates, the fundamental clash at the heart of this contest -- and so many others in what has been a remarkable season of upheaval in Democratic politics. Harris was critical of Carper's record, including two votes in particular that favored the banking industry and pharmaceutical companies, but the roots of her challenge ran deeper.\n\nA different kind of politics\n\nTheir exchanges at a debate last week, the only one of the campaign, made clear the ideological and stylistic gulf. When Harris, in response to a question about college costs, said she would push for the elimination of all student debt, Carper dismissed the suggestion as plainly unrealistic.\n\n\"I don't have a magic wand that would enable us to do that,\" he said. \"It would cost a pretty penny.\"\n\n\"What bothered me,\" Harris said days later of his response, \"is that there's this idea that these are extreme ideas. But they only seem to be extreme for those who are multimillionaires living in Congress. They don't feel extreme to the people that you speak to in the streets. ... We see that 'magic wands' are always available and present when corporations win.\"\n\nShe also criticized Carper's vote in 2006 to elevate current Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Carper was the only Democrat still in the Senate to cross party lines.\n\nAsked during the debate why he had backed Kavanaugh then, Carper said his decision turned on the guidance of distinguished Delaware Judge Walter Stapleton, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, and other respected jurists from the state.\n\n\"I voted my hopes over my fears,\" he concluded. \"I will not do that again.\"\n\nAt the debate, Harris returned to Carper's explanation when questioned about her inexperience in elected office, suggesting that his vote on Kavanaugh and, more recently, to back former drug company executive Alex Azar as the new secretary of health and human services underlined the need for a \"diversity of experience.\"\n\n\"It's scary when you hear him say, 'I voted for Kavanaugh because all of his people (vouched for him),' \" she said on Monday. \"That's also the excuse for why he voted for Azar. He said he knew someone who went to Yale with him and said he was a good guy. If that's your reason for voting on things that can affect all of our lives, that's a problem.\"\n\nCarper said in a statement after the confirmation vote that he believed Azar was qualified for the job and shared his desire to transform the health care system \"to one that rewards health care providers based on the quality of care patients receive.\"\n\nThe shadows of 2010?\n\nDelaware is no stranger to unexpected primary challenges -- or bewitching outcomes.\n\nThe state has mostly elected some combination of the same handful of leading politicians, from both parties, over the past few decades. But as the Harris challenge gained steam, chatter increased about the fate of Republican Mike Castle, the former governor, lieutenant governor and congressman whose defeat in 2010 to a tea party outsider effectively squandered what had been viewed as a winnable Senate seat.\n\nEight years on, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who defeated Republican nominee Christine O'Donnell that November, warned that a win for Harris on Thursday could similarly imperil what's now considered a safe Democratic seat.\n\n\"I think it would be dramatically harder for (Harris) to win in November than Tom Carper,\" Coons said in a phone interview. \"I think there were a number of Delaware Republicans who voted for Christine O'Donnell in 2010 to send a message to Mike Castle, that they wanted him to be a little sharper, little more conservative, little more ideologically pure.

Carper also boasted nearly every big ticket endorsement the state has to offer, from Biden to the Delaware AFL-CIO, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the state teachers union. The Working Families Party's outlay alone nearly matched Harris' total fundraising, which came in at around $120,000.\n\n\"We're investing substantially in the race because Carper is operating a version of the Democratic Party that might've passed muster in the 1990s,\" Dinkin said. \"But it is not the direction progressives want to see right now.\""}{"id": 15, "name": "Obama to unveil 'pointed' midterm message", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/obama-pointed-midterm-message/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "President Barack Obama, to the chagrin of some Democrats, has spent much of 2018 on the sidelines to what top party operatives believe is a generational fight against President Donald Trump.", "keywords": ["campaign", "unveil", "democrats", "message", "democratic", "office", "midterm", "politics", "obamas", "speech", "obama", "pointed", "president"], "summary": "That ends Friday, Obama advisers tell CNN, when the former president unveils his midterm message in a speech that will be a more pointed rebuke of Trump's first years in office.\nObama's office announced his first round of endorsements earlier this year and the official said his second round of endorsements will be released in the coming weeks.\nThat speech, in the eyes of Obama's team, was not a preview of the former President's midterm message.\nObama will quickly take the message on the road after he leaves Illinois.\n\"Next week, President Obama will offer new thoughts on this moment and what it requires from the American people,\" she said.", "content": "(CNN) President Barack Obama, to the chagrin of some Democrats, has spent much of 2018 on the sidelines to what top party operatives believe is a generational fight against President Donald Trump.\n\nThat ends Friday, Obama advisers tell CNN, when the former president unveils his midterm message in a speech that will be a more pointed rebuke of Trump's first years in office.\n\nThe speech at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign comes ahead of Obama's first campaign events of the midterms: A rally for a handful of Democratic congressional candidates in California on Saturday and an event for Richard Cordray , the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, on September 13.\n\nObama is also planning campaign trips to Illinois and Pennsylvania in September, an Obama official said, as well as a New York fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee , an organization led former Attorney General Eric Holder, Obama's longtime friend. Obama's office announced his first round of endorsements earlier this year and the official said his second round of endorsements will be released in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Friday speech will be \"a pointed\" critique of the current state of affairs in Washington, one Obama adviser said, where the Democratic heavyweight will be \"much more, much more pointed about what's at stake right now\" and how \"people need to take their responsibility seriously.\"\n\nThe Obama team selected his acceptance speech for the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government as the forum to lay out his midterm message because it offers a less politically charged environment for the President to explain his current political views.\n\n\"We thought it was important to find a setting where he can find a cogent, rational argument outside of the more chaotic campaign appearances that come this fall,\" the adviser said. \"The speech will lay down a frame and his message for fall. He will lay out his views about where we are and where we go from here.\"\n\nAnother Obama office official said they could not say whether the former President will mention Trump directly but added that \"regardless of whether he mentions him by name, it will be very clear who he is talking about.\"\n\nThe Trump era has complicated Obama's post-presidency. A series of former Presidents have avoided critiquing their successors and Obama has attempted to keep that tradition since leaving office two years ago. The distance has annoyed some Democrats, who believe their most potent weapon is sitting out the midterms in an effort to maintain decorum that has long left politics.\n\nBut Obama's foray into pure politics also threatens to ignite Republicans -- including the President -- who have made undoing much of his eight years in office a key objective. Trump, through Twitter and at campaign events, has shown little regard for his predecessors and would likely relish the opportunity to use Obama to rally Republicans in November.\n\nObama never said Trump's name during a fundraising speech he delivered earlier this year for the Democratic National Committee and instead urged Democrats to stop \"moping\" and get to work for candidates.\n\n\"If what you are doing requires no sacrifice at all, then you can do more,\" Obama told the crowd at a sweeping multi-million-dollar Beverly Hills home. \"If you are one of these folks who is watching cable news at your cocktail parties with your friends and you are saying 'civilization is collapsing' and you are nervous and worried, but that is not where you are putting all your time, energy and money, then either you don't actually think civilization is collapsing ... or you are not pushing yourself hard enough and I would push harder.\"\n\nThat speech, in the eyes of Obama's team, was not a preview of the former President's midterm message. Instead, Obama's advisers believe his midterm message will more closely resemble the remarks the former President delivered in South Africa as part of an event honoring the late Nelson Mandela.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama speaks about 'strange and uncertain times' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama speaks about 'strange and uncertain times' 01:55\n\nObama used the remarks to warn against the rise of \"strongman politics\" and the \"utter loss of shame among political leaders\" who lie. The remarks were seen as a clear broadside against Trump, despite the fact Obama never mentioned his successor.\n\n\"The politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear. And that kind of politics is now on the move. It's on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago,\" he told the audience in Johannesburg. \"I am not being alarmist, I'm simply stating the facts. Look around \u2014 strongman politics are ascendant, suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained, the form of it, where those in powers seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning.\"\n\nObama began working on his midterm messaging around the same time he delivered the South African speech, working with speechwriter Cody Kennan and other members of his team to craft political remarks that deliver an effective rebuke to the current state of Washington while also inspiring Democrats to vote.\n\n\"I think people will see this as his unvarnished take on what is happening in the political environment right now,\" the adviser said.\n\nObama will quickly take the message on the road after he leaves Illinois.\n\nOn Saturday, the former President will kick off his campaigning for House members in California with a joint rally in Orange County for Josh Harder (CA-10), TJ Cox (CA-21), Katie Hill (CA-25), Gil Cisneros (CA-39), Katie Porter (CA-45), Harley Rouda (CA-48), and Mike Levin (CA-49).\n\nAll seven of those districts represent the best chance Democrats have to swing races from red to blue in November: Hillary Clinton, Democrats 2016 nominee, won each district, despite the fact each is represented by a Republican in Congress.\n\n\"Democrats need all hands on deck to take back the House, and we could not be more honored to have President Barack Obama's inspirational voice and unifying message on the campaign trail, with his first stop in Southern California,\" said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Ben Ray Lujan, a New Mexico congressman.\n\nObama will then travel to Ohio on September 13 for a rally with Cordray and Democratic lieutenant governor candidate Betty Sutton in Cleveland. Obama encouraged Cordray, the former Obama administration official and Ohio attorney general, to run for office and the race was long seen one the former President could get involved in.\n\nKatie Hill, Obama's spokeswoman, said the Friday speech will be a continuation of a series of speeches the President gave during his final year in office, where he laid out challenges he believed were facing the United States.\n\n\"Next week, President Obama will offer new thoughts on this moment and what it requires from the American people,\" she said. \"He will expand upon several of the themes from his summer address, including that America is at its best when our democracy is inclusive and our citizens are engaged.\"\n\nShe added: \"He will echo his call to reject the rising strain of authoritarian politics and policies.

Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizer . The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Former President Barack Obama is coming back to the spotlight. In his second major address in the span of one week \u2014 the first coming with his powerful eulogy to the late Sen. John McCain that warned of the dangers facing democracy \u2014 Obama will launch his midterm campaign tour to help Democrats retake control of the US Congress.\n\nFollowing a speech at the University of Illinois on Friday, he will take off to Irvine, California, where he will speak at an event for seven Democrats running in Republican districts, and then continue on to other regions.\n\nHis reappearance on the public square is an important development at a moment when President Donald Trump's governing style has generated tremendous concern about the stability of our democratic institutions. While it is true that ex-presidents often remain out of the public limelight, these are not ordinary times.\n\nBob Woodward's new book, \"Fear,\" is filled with stories about top advisers doing everything possible to contain their boss. One stunning moment involves Gary Cohn, the former director of the National Economic Council, literally stealing papers off Trump's desk because he was so concerned about what the President might do with the information they held. Woodward also recounts people in Trump's inner circle seriously questioning his intelligence and fitness to serve.\n\nWhether one is concerned about his stability as a leader or the direction of his policies such as immigration, polls are showing that a growing number of Americans are discontented with the way the President is handling his role. In a shocking New York Times op-ed, one anonymous senior official in the administration admits that many fellow officials are \"working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations ... many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office.\"\n\nIf the stories that are coming out of Washington are true, then it is fair to say that we do have a genuine constitutional crisis on our hands: a President who is not fit to serve and who can't be trusted to hold the levers of power.\n\nBut anonymous op-eds and a bureaucratic \"resistance\" won't do anything other than enable President Trump. With congressional Republicans unwilling to serve as a force of institutional restraint, the only real answer would come with a Democratic Congress. Congressional Republicans have been given an opportunity to demonstrate they could prioritize the health of democratic institutions over partisan interests. They have failed that test.\n\nAs the conservative pundit George Will wrote in his Washington Post column, referring to the administration's decision to separate families at the border, \"the policy has given independents and temperate Republicans \u2014 these are probably expanding and contracting cohorts, respectively \u2014 fresh if redundant evidence for the principle by which they should vote. The principle: The congressional Republican caucuses must be substantially reduced.\"\n\nThis is a message that Obama, more than almost any other Democrat, has the capacity to share with the electorate. He did this at McCain's memorial and he can do it repeatedly in the next few months. Although Democrats warn that Obama's re-emergence will energize Republicans to remain steadfast behind Trump, the strength of Republican partisanship does not revolve around the former president. The radicalization of the Republican electorate has been a multidecade process and the extremists in the party find new foils whenever one disappears.\n\nThose Republicans who are willing to come out to vote Republican, despite having Trump in the White House, are already energized. Indeed, this was one of the great lessons of Obama's term in office: No matter how much Democrats lean over to be civil or to achieve political peace with the other party, the radicalization of the GOP has created an electorate that always sees blood red. Although pre-Trump politics of 2010 and 2014 may now seem benign, Obama underestimated the ferocity of the Republicans in the midterm elections during his presidency. Now he and his fellow party members should not make the same mistake again.\n\nThe former president, who remains enormously popular, can avoid speaking about specific policies if he fears that speeches about the Affordable Care Act or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program might shift the agenda away from the most glaring challenge that the nation faces: President Trump himself.\n\nAs a person who held the highest office in the land and handled that role in a manner that earned widespread respect, even from opponents who staunchly disagreed with his ideas, Obama, with his articulate nature, has the gravitas to argue for the fierce urgency of electing a Democratic Congress. Few can forget the emotional power of his address about race relations in Philadelphia during the heat of the 2008 campaign or his powerful farewell address after the tumultuous 2016 election.\n\nNow the nation needs an orator of that potency to make the case that restoring the traditional balance of power might be the most important issue this nation now faces. This needs to motivate every Democrat, and even some Republicans, in addition to fueling a fight for a particular set of policies.\n\nIn addition, speaking to America about creating an institutional check on a runaway president, Obama has the capacity to draw crowds and money to the most important races that will determine the future of the House and Senate. While the Koch brothers have the ability to directly deliver big bucks to loyal Republican candidates, Obama has the ability to draw comparable resources simply through his presence in a particular campaign. It is difficult to think of any Democrat at this moment -- perhaps except for his wife, Michelle -- who can draw the same kind of energy and attention.\n\nLike her husband, Michelle Obama has also joined the effort to bolster Democrats' chances to win elections in November. She has launched a voter registration initiative, which, while nonpartisan in its messaging, will drive young voters who tend to lean left to the polls.\n\nIs there a danger the Obamas' presence will somehow crowd out the most exciting voices in the Democratic Party who are starting to prepare for 2020? The answer is no.\n\nIf the Obamas handle this the right way, they will only create a stronger platform, which might include a Democratic Congress, from which the emerging stars of the party can launch their campaigns. The notion that a party can't walk and chew gum at the same time is a figment of a politically insecure mind. Political parties that are really aiming for big victories bring all their assets to the electoral table.\n\nOne of the most damaging mistakes that Barack Obama made when he was in the White House was to shy away from the electoral battlefield when the future of Congress and state legislatures was at stake. In my book about his presidency, I have recounted the high costs the Democrats paid by 2016 as Republicans essentially ran the table at all levels of government.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn 2018, the stakes are even higher. The former president seems to have a clear-eyed understanding of the dangers the nation faces. By taking to the campaign trail to support Democrats across the country, Obama can play a vital role in helping to rebuild the strength of our democratic institutions."}{"id": 17, "name": "Twitter bans Alex Jones and InfoWars", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/06/technology/twitter-suspends-alex-jones-infowars/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "Twitter banned far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website InfoWars from its platform Thursday afternoon, a month after several of its Silicon Valley counterparts did so.", "keywords": ["twitter", "infowars", "jones", "periscope", "tweets", "alex", "rubio", "victims", "darcy", "dorsey", "senator", "bans"], "summary": "Twitter banned far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website InfoWars from its platform Thursday afternoon, a month after several of its Silicon Valley counterparts did so.\nIn a series of tweets from its @TwitterSafety account, Twitter said, \"Today, we permanently suspended @realalexjones and @infowars from Twitter and Periscope.\nTwitter also said that it \"will take action\" if in the future it discovers other accounts being used to get around the ban of Jones and InfoWars.\nJones had traveled to Washington D.C.

Amazon also noted that it offers health and disability insurance, as well as retirement savings plans, company stock, tuition payments and up to 20 weeks of paid leave. The company says it created more than 130,000 new jobs in the U.S. last year.\n\nAmazon posted on Wednesday the positive responses that several employees sent to Sanders and shared with the company.

Also, it may lead some companies to pressure their employees not to sign up for benefits.\n\nPlus, the legislation likely wouldn't do much to raise wages, the center said. Companies would have to raise wages for all workers in particular job categories, which would be more expensive than paying the new tax, the center said.\n\nSanders' campaign says they have added provisions to the bill to help prevent those things from happening, such as making it unlawful for a large employer to ask an employee whether or not they qualify for federal benefits."}{"id": 30, "name": "Police search home of couple who raised $400,000 for homeless man", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/us/philadelphia-gofundme-homeless-trnd/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "Police executed a search warrant Thursday morning to comb through the home of the couple who raised $400,000 for a homeless Philadelphia man.", "keywords": ["mcclure", "400000", "bobbitt", "search", "couple", "man", "twist", "raised", "homeless", "johnny", "warrant", "executed", "touched", "township"], "summary": "(CNN) Police executed a search warrant Thursday morning to comb through the home of the couple who raised $400,000 for a homeless Philadelphia man.\nIt's the latest twist in an escalating feud over the money and what happened to it.\nKate McClure and Mark D'Amico have been embroiled in a legal fight with Johnny Bobbitt Jr. after they started a GoFundMe account for him.\nAccording Florence Township, New Jersey, police Chief Brian Boldizar, the warrant was for a search of a property belonging to McClure and D'Amico.\nIn a statement, Burlington County Prosecutor Scott A.

Choi -- who requested she only be identified by her last name -- was left speechless. No apartments looked into hers and she had been completely unaware of being watched, or even that she could possibly be watched.\n\nShe couldn't sleep that night, consumed by a growing paranoia that someone was still spying on her.\n\n\"I'm scared to be at home right now because that's where it happened,\" she told CNN. \"I was filmed at my own place so I don't want to be here but also I'm scared to leave the apartment even though it's broad daylight.\"\n\nSince 2011, the number of cases of illegal filming in South Korea has leaped from 1,300 a year to more than 6,000 in 2017. Women have been recorded in their homes, had upskirt photos taken on the streets, and been caught on spy cams hidden in toilets and changing rooms. Footage has been shared widely online, uploaded to streaming sites and shared on voyeur forums.\n\nIn the past four months, tens of thousands of women have joined protests in central Seoul under the slogan \"My Life is Not Your Porn.\" Wearing masks and displaying banners demanding the government to take action to protect them and prosecute men caught filming, the anger and frustration among the protesters was palpable, compounded by the long delay in seeing even slight official action.\n\nOn Monday, a special squad of women inspectors began daily checks of 20,000 public toilets in Seoul, with plans for tens of thousands of private toilets to also be scoured for spy cams. Some districts have dubbed the teams \"safety sheriffs,\" kitting them out with broad-brimmed cowboy hats.\n\nBut while this approach has received widespread press coverage and promotion by the local authorities, activists and victims say it's not enough, and they still face a lack of interest and understanding from police and some lawmakers.

They then send a letter, or a legal notice if necessary, to website administrators requesting it be taken down.\n\nLee Ji-soo works as a \"digital undertaker,\" helping victims remove illegal photos and videos from the internet.\n\nWhile most websites are willing to remove illegal videos or those shared without permission, Lee said there is a \"golden window\" of about 10 days after a video is uploaded during which it can be easily scrubbed from the internet. After that it gets more and more difficult, as copies spread to other websites and servers outside Korea.\n\nHow fast such videos spread is especially problematic for victims of hidden camera pornography, most of whom are completely unaware they have been recorded and may not become so until months or even years after the video is first uploaded. The speed of transmission is increased by forums and websites dedicated to sharing illegal upskirt videos and revenge porn, many of which have proven difficult to stamp out.\n\nLee said her company had seen a spike in searches for \"digital undertakers\" and requests for help as the issue has received more attention in South Korea.\n\n\"The most common things that the clients are saying -- and they are quite heartbreaking -- are 'I want to die' or 'I cannot leave my house.' Especially the victims of spy cam or illegally taken videos say that when they encounter people on the street, they feel like they would be recognized,\" she said.\n\nThousands of women protest against illegal filming on August 4, 2018 in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nAsked how women can defend themselves from being a victim of this type of crime, Lee was quick to point out they are not remotely at fault for appearing in these videos.\n\n\"In a way, these people were just walking on the street when a rock had unexpectedly landed on them,\" she said. \"So I cannot tell these people to change their behavior and I shouldn't either.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the government began offering similar services to Lee's company. The Digital Sex Crimes Victim Support Center provides consultation and removal services, and officials said that within the first 50 days of operation it helped 500 victims remove more than 2,200 videos online. It also provides victims legal support to file criminal charges and takedown notices.\n\nThe government has also said it will provide $4.5 million in funds to local authorities to increase patrols of toilets and changing rooms to search for spy cameras.\n\nA hidden-camera search squad, consisting of student and citizen volunteers, scan a restroom near a public pool in Changwon, South Korea on July 25, 2018.\n\nJustice denied\n\nWhile the authorities have been keen to be seen to take action, spurred by the mass protests in downtown Seoul, Choi said the biggest frustration in her case came from her experience with the police.\n\nUnlike in most instances of illegal filming, the man spying on Choi was actually spotted in the act and the police called. But Choi learned that he was only briefly interrogated and later released without charge. His house was not searched for a full week after the incident, during which time Choi suspected he may have destroyed evidence of other illegal filming.\n\nShe blamed the police for not taking the matter seriously, and said \"if this is how the law works here then the law needs to change.\"\n\nA general view of Seoul at night. Choi was naked at home alone in her apartment when she was filmed through her 22nd floor window.\n\nResponding to a request for comment, police told CNN officers made the decision not to arrest the perpetrator after he willingly accompanied them to the police station and surrendered his camera and memory card. They said the delay in checking his home was due to a wait to process a search warrant.\n\nChoi's suspicions about official attitudes towards illegal filming are supported by the data however. While the current law states that those caught illegally taking or distributing videos can be sentenced to up to five years in prison, only about 5% of convictions result in jail time, and most perpetrators receive fines or suspended sentences, according to a study by the Korean Women Lawyers Association.\n\nThere was outrage in August when, after months of protests by women calling for stricter sentencing of the mostly male perpetrators a woman was jailed for illegally photographing a naked man during a life drawing session.\n\nThis playful poster made by South Korean police for its new online campaign to help curb spycam porn crimes seems to sum up how the police view the widespread crimes causing so much fear & anxiety among women : funny, laughable pranks committed by pink-cheeked man-boys. pic.twitter.com/uAQlyrxMwX \u2014 Hawon Jung (@allyjung) August 9, 2018\n\nPolice also attracted widespread criticism after they released -- and subsequently withdrew -- a public information campaign depicting the perpetrators of illegal filming as mischievous boys and encouraging the public to take selfies with cut-outs of the childishly dressed mascots.\n\nLast week, lawmaker Kim Young-ho of the ruling Democratic Party proposed changes to the law to impose harsher sentences on the illegal filming of sexual acts, including upskirt videos.\n\n\"When an illegal video spreads, it robs a person and ruins their life. Though it's a grave crime, the law and the punishment had not been strict,\" he told CNN.\n\nWhile the bill is expected to pass this year, Kim warned that the law still needs to be tweaked further.\n\n\"If the victim is clothed, there is no legal ground for punishment. So in order to protect the privacy, we proposed the bill that seeks to punish the act of filming without permission even if the subject had been clothed,\" he said.\n\nA protester holds up a sign at a demonstration in central Seoul on August 4. More protests are expected this month.\n\nThe ability to impose stricter punishments does not necessarily mean courts and prosecutors will take advantage of this, however. Beyond the law, Choi said general attitudes within South Korean society need to change, especially among men, many of whom she felt still do not take illegal filming seriously.\n\nFor her, the experience has dramatically changed her outlook and assessment of the country she lives in.\n\n\"You can never feel comfortable in your own body if you're a woman here,\" she said. \"That's how I started feeling. Just because I'm born as a woman, people objectify me. People objectify my body, even when I'm in the most private place.\""}{"id": 34, "name": "Starbucks is opening its first store in Italy.

Is it too soon to start thinking about Jim Harbaugh's coaching future? Lane Kiffin's? What are the must-watch games for Week 2? Bleacher Report's Adam Kramer has the answers to those questions and more in his weekly college football notebook, the Thursday Tailgate.\n\nThe first time I saw the most dangerous true freshman in college football's 2018 season, he was a high schooler working out in a dimly lit gym across the street from the Louisville airport.\n\nIt was six months ago, and Rondale Moore was a senior at Trinity High School in St. Matthews, Kentucky. A 5'9\", 175-pound wide receiver capable of squatting more than three times his body weight, he had committed to play at Purdue over Texas, Alabama, Ohio State and dozens of other traditional powers.\n\nAlthough I hadn't made the trip to see Moore\u2014I was there to write a story about a 370-pound eighth-grader who was already receiving scholarship offers\u2014he was impossible to miss.\n\nThe way he seemed to hit full speed in a matter of steps. The way he would seemingly jump out of the gym to catch high throws. Even the most natural catches felt spectacular.\n\nHis legend would grow over the months that followed, thanks to a video that went viral of him squatting 600 pounds.\n\n\"I wasn't surprised, honestly,\" says Chris Vaughn, the owner of that gym in Louisville, Aspirations Fitness, who trained Moore throughout high school and says he regularly watched Moore squat 415 pounds 15 times. \"I thought he could've done more. It looked a little too easy.\"\n\nBut even he might have been surprised by what he saw last Thursday. In his first collegiate game, Moore broke Purdue's single-game all-purpose yards record\u2014a mark that had stood for more than 40 years. And he nearly did so in his first half of college ball.\n\nAlthough he dropped the first pass thrown his way, Moore responded by scoring two touchdowns in the first quarter\u2014a 32-yard touchdown grab and a 76-yard touchdown run, highlighted by a juke that would have made former USC great Reggie Bush proud.\n\nEven his marginal gains felt spectacular: a mix of speed and shake and high-stepping that made it feel like every touch could be a touchdown. Altogether, Moore finished his first game with 109 receiving yards, 79 rushing yards, 125 kick-return yards and two touchdowns.\n\nFor those who watched Moore excel over the past few years, the performance, as spectacular as it was, felt like a matter of time. But even they struggled to convey Moore's potential to college coaches for years because of his size.\n\nAlthough he is listed at 5'9\", it feels generous. And because of that, college coaches didn't flock to recruit the wideout during his high school career.\n\n\"I tried to tell a couple different people I know,\" says Trinity offensive coordinator Andrew Coverdale. \"I have never seen anything like his ability to change directions when he hits the top speed quickly.\n\n\"I tried to tell them they needed to get in on it now, and by and large they didn't listen to me.\"\n\nMoore began his high school career at New Albany High in Indiana before transferring to powerhouse Trinity prior to his junior year.\n\nTransfer rules deemed Moore ineligible for much of his junior season, but when he returned to the field for the team's final four games, he made up for lost time, catching 20 passes for 464 yards and nine touchdowns. His arrival helped Trinity win the Class 6-A state title.\n\nAnd even then there were doubts about a player 247Sports' composite listed as the nation's No. 41 wide receiver in the class of 2018.\n\nIt wasn't until Moore clocked a blazing 4.33 in the 40-yard dash and posted a 42-inch vertical at The Opening, Nike's mega-recruiting summit, that the coaches stampeded to Trinity.\n\nAfter committing and then decommitting from Texas, Moore pledged his commitment to Purdue on national television in January during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. The fact that one of the most coveted playmakers in the country picked a program that had won 16 of its previous 61 games sent a shock wave through the recruiting world.\n\nBut Purdue head coach Jeff Brohm, a former Trinity grad, began recruiting Moore long before many others did. Couple that with a seven-win season, Brohm's knack for creative play-calling and the vicinity to Moore's hometown, and the receiver was sold.\n\n\"This guy has some playmaking ability,\" Brohm says of Moore. \"It's definitely seen by us and all of his teammates.\"\n\nSix months after I stumbled upon the undersized Trinity wideout, and a star is born. Although Moore has played exactly 60 minutes of college football, he left a first impression like few others that have ever played the sport.\n\nAnd because he's capable of playing so many different roles\u2014roles that Purdue needs to fill\u2014defensive coordinators have been put on notice.\n\n\"I mean, there's nothing he can't do,\" Coverdale says. \"It's really remarkable. I don't even know how to describe how liberating it is. He's really only limited by your imagination.\"\n\nNext up? Eastern Michigan on Saturday, which will undoubtedly have a game plan in place to slow him down.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJim Harbaugh and the expectations game\n\nPaul Sancya/Associated Press\n\nWhat's next for Jim Harbaugh?\n\nIn the short term, the answer is most likely Michigan's first victory of 2018. Coming off a season-opening loss to Notre Dame, the Wolverines play Western Michigan in Week 2, and whether their offensive line and play-calling are fixed shouldn't matter for that one. (If it does, we will revisit said topic next week.)\n\nThrough his first 40 games at Michigan, Harbaugh (28-12) has one more win than Brady Hoke (27-13) had as head coach of the Wolverines. On Saturday, it will have been one year since a Michigan wide receiver caught a touchdown pass. Harbaugh makes more money than almost any of his peers, and he has yet to win a conference title or deliver a truly memorable victory.\n\nSo there are reasons to be concerned at the start of his fourth year. Expectations are not being met. But the idea that Harbaugh is even remotely close to the \"hot seat\" is misguided.\n\nThere is a perception and mentality that is growing tiresome with head coaching tenures: You're either getting fired or you're not. There is no go-between. In the instance of Harbaugh, however, it's reasonable to find some sort of middle ground, at least for the time being.\n\nThe program is in far better shape than it was under Hoke. There is talent in place, and it feels like winning is simply a matter of time. Whether this comes at a Nick Saban or Urban Meyer level\u2014a ridiculous bar that Harbaugh is expected to clear, which is perhaps part of the problem\u2014is still to be decided.\n\nBut it seems appropriate to let things play out a while longer, though, yes, that's getting tougher to say as the games go by.\n\nRegardless, Harbaugh isn't going anywhere unless he does on his own accord.\n\n(Unless he loses to Western Michigan this weekend. Then let's talk.)\n\nA wild (sort of) solution to save Kansas football: Hire Lane Kiffin\n\nSue Ogrocki/Associated Press\n\nBear with me for a moment, if you will.\n\nKansas lost to Nicholls State this past weekend\u2014the latest, lowest point for the Jayhawks.\n\nFlorida Atlantic, meanwhile, after winning 10 games in a row to end last year, lost to Oklahoma by roughly 17,456 points.\n\nThings should get better for FAU head coach Lane Kiffin in the weeks and months ahead. The schedule says it will. But for Kansas, something drastic has to be done to right a program that has won 15 games since 2010. (Alabama won 13 last season.)\n\nSo why not bring in someone who can A) score touchdowns B) recruit and C) generate buzz simply by being himself (and tweeting).\n\nKiffin has made no indication he would want this job or would leave FAU, but there is some potential allure here. He could build from the ground up at a school with zero expectations. He could return to a Power Five conference. And if it doesn't work out, he could land on his feet somewhere else. (Saving Kansas football is hard, after all. And Lane Kiffin always lands on his feet.)\n\nWill it happen? Almost certainly not. Call it wishful thinking.\n\nKiffin will likely be able to do better than Kansas, assuming the next few months finish as they should. But after all that Kansas football fans have endured the past decade, they deserve something to hope for.\n\nFive Games to Watch This Weekend\n\nIf this coming weekend's games were a food item, it would not be a dry-aged bone-in ribeye. More like a nice seared chicken breast with quality sides.\n\nThe potential is there, but the chef has to deliver.\n\nThat's where we stand in Week 2, although there are some fascinating, critical matchups. (Also, let us not forget that the weekends lacking dynamite often find ways to self-combust in the best ways possible.)\n\nHere is what you should watch this weekend, in tweet-length form (all times Eastern):\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nNo. 17 USC at No. 10 Stanford (Saturday, 8:30 p.m.): Someone forgot to change Bryce Love's batteries\u2014that can be the only explanation for why the human cheat code ran for 29 yards on 18 carries in Week 1. That will change, although JT Daniels, USC's true frosh QB who should still be in high school, could arrive in a hurry.\n\nNo. 2 Clemson at Texas A&M (Saturday, 7 p.m.): The atmosphere in College Station is going to be delightful. This much we know. We also know that Texas A&M just gave head coach Jimbo Fisher $75 million to win games like these, albeit not this early in his tenure. Even a close game would be a big deal in Aggieland.\n\nNo. 3 Georgia at No. 24 South Carolina (Saturday, 3:30 p.m.): At this moment in time, South Carolina feels severely underrated. That could change this weekend against a popular playoff pick. At the very least, give this one\u2014and South Carolina's touchdown machine receiver, Deebo Samuel\u2014your full attention, just in case it does.\n\nUCLA at No. 6 Oklahoma (Saturday, 1 p.m.): The final score might not be close, but when coaches Lincoln Riley and Chip Kelly come together and try to score touchdowns against one another, there is no way you should miss it. Even if the point spread is greater than four touchdowns. (Gulp.)\n\nNo. 15 Michigan State at Arizona State (Saturday, 10:45 p.m.): Just look at that glorious start time. What are you going to do, sleep? Don't think so. You're going to watch Herm Edwards attempt to rip off a huge out-of-conference win at home. Given the teams and game time, something weird seems destined to happen.\n\nBONUS GAME: Arizona at Houston (Saturday, Noon): The season didn't start how it was supposed to for Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate. But watching all-everything defensive tackle Ed Oliver, who had 13 tackles last week, chase around the most exciting quarterback in the sport is too good to pass up.\n\nWhat else to watch for this weekend\n\nFirst, a new tradition: The Turnover Throne\n\nCelebrating turnovers in creative ways is the latest fad in college football, whether it's a belt or the much-discussed turnover chain in Miami. More and more teams are catching on.\n\nBut Boise State now has a stranglehold on the genre. Behold the turnover throne.\n\nInterested? The Broncos are a massive favorite against Connecticut this week, so you shouldn't have to wait long to see it.\n\nSecond, a new formation: Whatever the hell this is, from Mike Leach\n\nBless you, Mike Leach, for bringing something that would be banned from most turkey bowls to an actual football game. Against Wyoming in Week 1, Leach uncorked a bizarre formation that included an offset offensive line and a diagonal snap from a wide receiver.\n\nLeach says he calls this \"Big Gulp Left\" and that he came up with the idea while working with an engineer from Microsoft. Of course he did. Washington State kicks off at 11 p.m. Eastern this weekend against San Jose State, as if you needed any other motivation to tune in.\n\nGambling locks of the week\n\nLast Week: 2-3 (Ugh.)\n\nSeason to date: 2-3 (Ugh Part 2.)\n\nNot the start I was hoping for, obviously, but college football picks against the spread have no memories. I would tell you that these are for entertainment purposes only, but that doesn't sound like much fun.\n\nWe'll use the Westgate odds, courtesy of OddsShark, and hope we use them well.\n\nSouth Carolina (+10) vs. Georgia: This feels like a game that Georgia will win, but I don't believe it will come easy. South Carolina almost pulls this one off (and covers).\n\nFresno State (+2) @ Minnesota: A fascinating line for a team that just dropped 79 points in its opener. Fresno State is a live road dog here, without question.\n\nMiami (OH) (-1) vs. Cincinnati: This is one of my favorite spreads of the week and the ultimate letdown situation after Cincinnati beat UCLA in Week 1.\n\nArizona State (+6) vs. Michigan State: For as much as we all criticized the hire of Herm Edwards, ASU sure looked functional in Week 1. Sparky covers (and wins outright).\n\nPittsburgh (+8.5) vs. Penn State: An intriguing spot for Penn State after nearly losing in Week 1. The Nittany Lions will win, but it will have to be in thrilling fashion once again.\n\nAdam Kramer covers college football for Bleacher Report.

He has written a series of books documenting each of our recent presidents. So how did the White Houses of George W. Bush and Barack Obama handle Woodward when they learned he was writing on them? For that answer I reached out to Jen Psaki, former White House communications director in the Obama administration (and a CNN contributor) and Ari Fleischer , who served as the press secretary for Bush.\n\nOur conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n\nCillizza: Walk me through the thought process when you first heard that Woodward was working on a book about your boss, aka the president.\n\nPsaki: It is part of the rite of passage in a White House press office. He writes about every president, so we knew it was coming. Early on I remember a part of me thinking, 'cool, I love his writing and books.' Of course that comes with a huge dose of anxiety when you are working in the White House he is writing about. And anxiety only increases once he has written the first book.\n\nWoodward is not a White House reporter or someone waiting for statements or approval from the press office. We also knew that. So the monitoring of how the book was going and what exactly he had that was newsworthy was difficult, to say the least.\n\nThe first book on President Obama was about the decision-making around Afghanistan. It was early on, and we didn't have a defined strategy for any book. We definitely were better prepared the second time around, but it is really never a call you want.\n\nFleischer: Bob contacted Karen Hughes or Dan Bartlett (I don't remember who) to say he wanted to write a book about Bush's war on terror. The president decided he would cooperate with Bob, and that set the tone. If the president was cooperating, we all were cooperating -- not only in the White House but across the agencies.\n\nCillizza: Was there a strategy as to who would talk to Woodward and who wouldn't within the White House? Did people break those rules?\n\nPsaki: We got better at this as the years in the White House continued just by trial and error. In the first few years we were just trying to survive in part because we were dealing with a massive financial crisis and in part because most of us had never worked in a White House, and we started off not even knowing where the bathrooms were located.\n\nThe core decision was -- are we going to participate or not, and at what level? We played it both ways with different books at times, setting up interviews and at other times trying to maintain the ability to say we didn't participate. Either way you go, it can be hard to control book narratives. People always break the rules. The difference is the anecdotes in Woodward's second book about Obama were about who was more responsible for the budget deal falling apart, not about how the senior staff were ignoring the orders of the President and keeping decision papers off his desk.\n\nFleischer: Given the fact that President talked to Woodward, we all did. I don't recall any meetings to plan who he could or could not talk to. As far as I recall, all top people Woodward wanted to talk with : Given the fact that President talked to Woodward, we all did. I don't recall any meetings to plan who he could or could not talk to. As far as I recall, all top people Woodward wanted to talk with spoke to him\n\nCillizza: Woodward sat down for his books with both Obama and Bush. How hard a decision was that to make? Was the president in favor of it?\n\nPsaki: There is a calculation every White House makes regarding books and even big articles. If we participate, especially at the level of the president, we have less plausible deniability about the content and accuracy of the book.\n\nPresident Obama was always very thoughtful about these decisions. We would present our recommendation and the reasoning, and he ultimately decided. He never felt like he absolutely had to sit down with a writer and never demanded it. But having the ability to walk through themes of the book that were related to the president's decision making ultimately felt like it was worth it.\n\nFleischer: It was an easy decision to make. I do think it's fair to say that when things are going well, Woodward can make them better. When things are not going well, he can make them worse. His first book was reflective of a popular president.\n\nCillizza: Once Woodward's book came out, what percent of the stuff in it came as a total shock to you? And how did you handle the negative press?\n\nPsaki: Looking back, most of it should not have been a shock. The surprise was more about how detailed the leaks were about private conversations and negotiations.\n\nThere are only a few things you can do 1. Try to raise doubt about the accuracy by picking apart some pieces. 2. Attack the author. 3. Put out the people who are depicted in the book to pull it apart. We did versions of all of these. But ultimately when the themes of the book are not wildly wrong, it is only so effective to pull apart anecdotes. That is also the root of Trump's problem.\n\nFleischer: As I recall, the White House generally liked the first book, although there were some quotes (anonymous) that we did not like. There are of course criticisms of this matter or that matter, but for the most part, his first book was well-received.\n\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"The single best thing for Trump to do in response to the Woodward book is ________.\" Now, explain.\n\nPsaki: Have the legitimate and well-respected members of his team continue to go out and deny the accuracy of anecdotes and quotes. While we can all blow a hole in a lot of the statements including (John) Kelly's and (James) Mattis' given how carefully worded they are, they sow enough doubt that his supporters, and maybe even a swath of people in the middle, may not jump ship over the book. And stop talking and tweeting. Let surrogates do it for you.\n\nFleischer: \"Be Trump.\"\n\nFor better or worse, President Trump reacts uniquely. That's who he is. He is authentic, and you know where he stands. In President Trump's defense, there is no question anonymity can give people license to say things that are incorrect or go too far. His chief of staff and defense secretary have denied what they were alleged to have said. Woodward doesn't make things up and someone told him these two people said these things. Trump and his staff are within their rights to challenge the accuracy of whoever fed the information to Woodward."}{"id": 45, "name": "Burt Reynolds, \"Smokey and the Bandit\" star, dead at 82", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/entertainment/burt-reynolds-has-died/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "Burt Reynolds, the mustachioed megastar who first strutted on screen more than half a century ago, died Thursday, according to his agent, Todd Eisner.", "keywords": ["dead", "reynolds", "82", "star", "caption", "later", "tv", "film", "burt", "bandit", "23", "hide", "smokey", "photos"], "summary": "Photos: Burt Reynolds through the years Photos: Burt Reynolds through the years Actor Burt Reynolds, whose easygoing charms and handsome looks drew prominent roles in films such as \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and \"Boogie Nights,\" died Thursday, September 6.\nHide Caption 2 of 23 Photos: Burt Reynolds through the years Reynolds spends time with actress Lori Nelson circa 1959.\nHide Caption 3 of 23 Photos: Burt Reynolds through the years A bare-chested Reynolds stands on a kitchen set in 1960.\nHide Caption 12 of 23 Photos: Burt Reynolds through the years Reynolds appears with Sally Field in 1977's \"Smokey and the Bandit.\"\nHide Caption 17 of 23 Photos: Burt Reynolds through the years Russell Crowe and Reynolds star in \"Mystery, Alaska\" in 1999.", "content": "(CNN) Burt Reynolds, the mustachioed megastar who first strutted on screen more than half a century ago, died Thursday, according to his agent, Todd Eisner.\n\nHe was 82.\n\nThe Michigan native, whose easy-going charms and handsome looks drew prominent roles in films such as \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and \"Boogie Nights,\" suffered a cardiac arrest, Eisner said.

The movie's infamous rape scene may have helped the public -- especially men -- better understand the horrors of sexual attacks, Reynolds said.\n\n\"It was the only time I saw men get up, sick, and walk out of a theater,\" he added. \"I've seen women do that (before),\" but not men.\n\nBorn in Lansing, Michigan, Reynolds and his family moved to South Florida when he was 5, according to his autobiography.\n\nAt Palm Beach High School, he first made a name for himself as a football star and earned an athletic scholarship to Florida State University. But when injuries derailed a promising athletic career, Reynolds turned to acting.\n\nHe then scored small parts in the late 1950s before landing a role in the New York City Center revival of \"Mister Roberts\" in 1957, as well as a recurring spot in the TV series \"Gunsmoke.\"\n\nBy 1974, Reynolds had hit it big and starred as an ex-football player who landed in prison in the film \"The Longest Yard.\" Two years earlier, he broke taboo and posed nude in Cosmopolitan magazine, which helped cement his growing status as a sex symbol.\n\nHe later said he regretted that centerfold image, which showed Reynolds spread out across a bearskin rug, and said it distracted attention from his \"Deliverance\" co-stars and likely cost them an Academy Award.\n\nReynolds' notoriety soared through the late 1970s and 1980s, during which time he spearheaded the \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and \"Cannonball Run\" movie franchises. He also earned People's Choice Awards in 1979, 1982 and 1983 as all-around male entertainer of the year.\n\nBut he also turned down some of the biggest roles in Hollywood history, including James Bond to Han Solo in George Lucas' 1977 blockbuster \"Star Wars.\" Reynolds also reportedly was among Paramount Pictures' top choices to play Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 epic \"The Godfather.\"\n\nAgain, the star expressed regrets.\n\n\"I took the part that was the most fun. ... I didn't take the part that would be the most challenging,\" Reynolds said in an interview with CNN.\n\nHis love life also drew headlines after a high-profile divorce to actress Loni Anderson preceded Reynolds' bankruptcy filing in 1996.\n\nAnderson and Reynolds shared a son, Quinton.\n\n\"Quinton and I are extremely touched by the tremendous outpouring of love and support from friends and family throughout the world,\" Anderson wrote in a statement on Thursday. \"Burt was a wonderful director and actor. He was a big part of my life for 12 years and Quinton's life for 30 years. We will miss him and his great laugh.\"\n\nIn 1998, Reynolds scored his sole Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor, after his portrayal of a porn film producer in the film \"Boogie Nights,\" despite his dislike of the film and its apparent glorification of the porn industry.\n\nYears later, with a mustache gone gray, he suffered from health issues that led to open heart surgery. Reynolds also checked into a drug rehab clinic in 2009. The purpose was \"to regain control of his life\" after becoming addicted to painkillers prescribed following back surgery, his manager said.\n\nOnce among Hollywood's highest-paid actors, Reynolds later fell into financial trouble amid private ventures in an Atlanta restaurant and a professional sports team, though he continued to make cameo appearances and teach acting classes.\n\n\"I worked as an actor for 60 years, I must have something I can give,\" he told CNN.\n\nReynolds made an acting resurgence in recent years, appearing in numerous films and TV shows. He was cast in the upcoming Quentin Tarantino-directed \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" scheduled for release next year. Reynolds had not yet started shooting his appearance in the film.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that Reynolds was born in Michigan.

But considering that our last recession was a doozy, it's natural for folks to get concerned about another downturn.\n\nThankfully, there are things that all of us can do to prepare for our country's next recession, regardless of when it hits. Here are a few moves that'll help you get ready.\n\n1. Build an emergency fund\n\nWhen a recession strikes, investment portfolios tend to plummet, jobs become less stable, and raises become far less widespread. If you want to protect yourself from the effects of a recession, have a fully loaded emergency fund with six months' worth of living expenses socked away -- or more if your income is variable to begin with. This will give you the option to avoid liquidating investments at a loss when you need cash. It'll also give you some reserves to fall back on if you lose your job or find that your hours are cut.\n\n2. Diversify your investments\n\nA diversified portfolio is an investor's best friend, even during periods of economic prosperity. But during downturns, it could spell the difference between taking serious losses and recovering just fine.\n\nA diversified portfolio is one with a wide range of investments, including individual stocks and bonds, as well as mutual funds or index funds. Furthermore, those assets should be spread across different sectors of the market. For example, when choosing your individual stocks, you might load up on biotech companies, energy companies, and retailers so that if one of those segments does well, it can offset losses in another (or losses that stem from a broader market dip).\n\n3. Get a side job\n\nWhen the economy, on the whole, takes a dive, individual businesses tend to suffer. And that can all too easily lead the way to job loss. A good way to protect yourself, therefore, is to establish a solid side hustle while employed in a full-time capacity. This way, if you lose your primary source of income, you'll have a second stream to rely on as you look to get rehired.\n\nYou might even go so far as to take on a couple of different side gigs to lower your chances of finding yourself completely out of work. For example, you might retain your steady job as an engineer, design websites a couple of nights a week, and work as a dog walker on weekends. Incidentally, having that side gig will make it easier for you to build savings, which, as we just learned, is a crucial step in preparing for a recession.\n\n4. Lower your fixed living costs\n\nWhen your income drops, it becomes all the more difficult to keep up with your bills. One final thing you can do to be recession-ready is work on reducing some of the fixed expenses that currently eat up a large chunk of your paycheck. For example, if you're paying $1,500 a month for your mortgage, you might consider downsizing to a smaller property that only costs you $1,000 a month. That way, if your income takes a beating, you'll have an easier time managing your housing costs.\n\nRelated links:\n\n\u2022 Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n\u2022 This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n\u2022 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nWhether our next recession hits next year, the following year, or a decade later, it never hurts to be prepared.

But as long as his popularity ratings don't drop dramatically, he's likely to get confirmed.\n\nUsually, Supreme Court nominees are well liked even after intense confirmation hearings. Just after Kavanaugh was announced, I collected the final popularity ratings for all Supreme Court nominees since Robert Bork before their confirmation vote or withdrawal. (No poll was taken about Anthony Kennedy.)\n\nThe average net approval or favorability rating for these nominees was 20 percentage points.\n\nKavanaugh's net favorabilty rating is just above zero right now. No nominee who was as unpopular as Kavanaugh is currently has been confirmed in the modern era. Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination after being chosen by President George W. Bush, while Bork was voted down after being nominated by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nKavanaugh's low popularity certainly limits his potential to grab Democratic votes. Once we control for factors such as a nominee's qualifications and her or his ideological distance from each senator, a nominee's popularity has impacted how many votes they receive for confirmation. One of President George H.W. Bush's picks, Clarence Thomas, for example, probably wouldn't have been confirmed without his strong popularity ratings.\n\nThe problem for those hoping that Kavanaugh goes down is that popularity isn't the only thing that matters. Miers withdrew mostly because conservatives complained about her qualifications . Bork was voted down by a Democrat-controlled Senate because his conservative record was so extensive.\n\nKavanaugh has neither of those problems. He has been rated as \"well-qualified\" by the American Bar Association. Kavanaugh also will be voted upon by a Senate that is controlled by Republicans.\n\nWhen you combine the makeup of the Senate and Kavanaugh's judicial profile, his current popularity rating is probably not low enough to make any Republicans vote against him. He may even pick up a Democratic vote.\n\nNow, the potentially good news for Democrats is that nominees do tend to see their popularity drop after a confirmation hearing.\n\nBork, for example, initially had a one-point net favorability rating in a Times Mirror poll. That's more than 10 points higher than where his popularity rating ended up in a Los Angeles Times poll before the Senate voted him down.\n\nWhen I previously wrote on Kavanaugh, I noted that a Bork-like popularity might be low enough for Kavanaugh to get voted down. Specifically, it would on average lead to him getting 49 votes in favor compared to 50 votes against.\n\nThat, however, was back when Sen. John McCain was not healthy enough to be in Washington to vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation. In other words, back when Republicans really had only 50 senators to the Democrats' 49.\n\nThis week, Republican Jon Kyl was sworn in to fill McCain's seat. Kyl has a conservative voting record and was Kavanaugh's sherpa (i.e. the experienced Washington insider to guide him through the confirmation process ). There is pretty much no chance that Kyl would vote against Kavanaugh. That brings Kavanaugh to 50 votes on average in a hypothetical scenario in which his popularity matches the worst polling nominee on record by the end of the confirmation process.\n\nI guess it's possible that Kavanaugh could become even more unpopular than Bork was. In this highly partisan environment in which potential justices are far less likely to reveal their stances on matters of judicial importance than they were back when Bork was under consideration, it seems unlikely, however, that Kavanaugh's public numbers would move that much.\n\nIt's also possible that Kyl's connection to Kavanaugh might make him abstain from voting on him. Again though, that seems more like a Democratic fantasy than a potential reality.\n\nThe bottom line is that with 51 Republican senators, he's very likely to land on the Supreme Court."}{"id": 60, "name": "Another Roger Stone associate subpoenaed by Mueller", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/jerome-corsi-roger-stone-mueller-subpoena/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-05T00:00:00", "description": "Jerome Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist with ties to Roger Stone, has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury Friday as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, according to Corsi's attorney.", "keywords": ["york", "intelligence", "roger", "stone", "mueller", "associate", "corsis", "jury", "subpoenaed", "whos", "wikileaks", "muellers", "grand"], "summary": "(CNN) Jerome Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist with ties to Roger Stone, has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury Friday as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, according to Corsi's attorney.\n\"While we believe the focus will be on his communications with Roger Stone, that is an assumption.\"\nCorsi is the latest in a string of Stone associates to be summoned by Mueller's team.\nRandy Credico, a comedian who's another former associate of Stone's, is also slated to appear before the grand jury Friday.\nMeanwhile, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russian intelligence had hacked Democratic targets and used WikiLeaks to spread that material online.", "content": "(CNN) Jerome Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist with ties to Roger Stone, has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury Friday as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, according to Corsi's attorney.\n\n\"We are going to be fully cooperative.

Michael Capuano in the Democratic primary for a seat that has been held by the likes of John F. Kennedy and Tip O'Neill in the past.\n\nPressley ran as an unapologetic liberal, calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump and the abolishing of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was endorsed by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- the only other challenger to beat a Democratic House incumbent so far in 2018 -- and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a rising national star among liberals.\n\nIn short, Pressley's win had all the hallmarks of Ocasio-Cortez's victory over the summer -- a liberal insurgent candidate catches a more moderate, establishment member of Congress off-guard. Except that's not what happened here. At all.\n\nStart with the fact that Capuano is no one's idea of a moderate. According to VoteView ratings , Capuano is the 15th most liberal member of Congress -- and the most liberal member of the not-very-conservative Massachusetts delegation. That makes him more liberal than Nancy Pelosi (32nd) and close to as liberal as Maxine Waters (4th). Compare that to Rep. Joe Crowley, the Democrat that Ocasio-Cortez beat. Crowley was the 78th most liberal member, according to VoteView\n\nSo if Capuano didn't lose because he wasn't liberal enough, why did he lose? Two reasons.\n\n1. Tone\n\nThis primary didn't turn on the incumbent member of Congress voting in ways that were inconsistent with the wants and needs of his district. It was about what kind of liberalism voters in the Boston-area district wanted. Capuano's was a quiet liberalism; he always voted the right way for a district where Hillary Clinton won 83% of the vote in 2016, but he wasn't an activist. He wasn't demanding change. He wasn't storming the barricades. That was the sort of liberalism that Pressley promised. \"This district and these times demand more than just an ally, they demand an advocate and a champion,\" she said in announcing her candidacy . \"Making progress on longstanding challenges requires a different lens and a new approach.\"\n\nIn the wake of Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016, many liberals concluded that while the former secretary of state was with them on issues, she was too tonally moderate -- unwilling to talk about things like single-payer health care, for instance, for fear of alienating voters in the ideological middle. Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and newly minted Florida governor nominee Andrew Gillum are all liberals on the more activist end of the spectrum -- a reflection of what the Democratic Party base wants right now.\n\nOne example that illustrates the tonal difference between Capuano and Pressley: Trump impeachment. Capuano spent much of 2017 urging caution for Democrats who wanted articles of impeachment brought against Trump. \"We have to respect the process,\" the Boston Globe quoted Capuano writing in a May 2017 newsletter . \"It shouldn't be a witch hunt or a political statement.\" While Capuano eventually came around and voted for a measure that would have begun the impeachment process against Trump, he was dogged by the idea he was only doing so out of reaction to Pressley's challenge. Of Trump's impeachment, Pressley said : \"I'd cast that vote, but a vote is not enough. As leaders we have to ask ourselves as we navigate this new and dangerous terrain together -- how do we resist and progress at the same time?\"\n\n2. The Democratic Party's changing face\n\nBoston -- and the Democratic Party -- is in the midst of a massive transformation from a working class, largely white majority into a far more racially and ethnically diverse one. As the Almanac of American Politics notes , Boston was a 95% white city in 1950; it is now 25% black and 19% Hispanic. The Almanac also notes that Boston is now populated by \"young singles in rowhouse apartments, professionals in waterfront apartment towers and African-Americans in old triple-deckers.\"\n\nWhile Pressley bristled at the idea that she was running primarily as a black candidate, the fact that she was a young, African-American woman (Pressley is 44) and Capuano was an older white man (he is 66) was obvious. And rhetorically, Pressley pushed the idea that she was the new face of a new Boston -- not exactly a racial appeal, but one clearly aimed at suggesting that Capuano represented a Democratic Party that no longer exists.\n\n\"This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy,\" Pressley said in the campaign . \"This is a disruptive candidacy, a grassroots coalition. It is broad and diverse and deep. People of every walk of life.\"\n\nPressley's win -- as well as the victory of Ocasio-Cortez, a female Puerto Rican-American candidate -- speak to that more diverse coalition within the party. As Cook Political Report House editor David Wasserman noted in a tweet on Tuesday night\n\n\"The share of House Rs who are white men is 86% and rising.\n\n\"The share of House Dems who are white men is 41% and falling.\"\n\nMake no mistake: The energy of the Democratic Party is on the left. But it's not that simple. Democrats don't just want to nominate liberals. They want to nominate liberals who a) are ready to fight President Trump on literally everything and b) who look more like the new base of the Democratic Party.\n\nThose are the lessons of Ayanna Pressley's win that ambitious 2020 Democrats need to learn."}{"id": 62, "name": "When Moon travels North, will he return with a gift for Trump?", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/moon-kim-korea-summit-intl/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "For the first time since he chose to engage with the world, North Korea's Kim Jong Un has proposed a possible timeline for ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons: by the end of President US Donald Trump's first term in office.", "keywords": ["korean", "gift", "koreas", "trump", "denuclearization", "north", "return", "south", "travels", "nuclear", "moon", "pyongyang", "korea", "kim"], "summary": "Chung was part of a South Korean delegation that crossed the border into North Korea on Wednesday and met with Kim.\nNorth Korea's reluctance to do anything outside of its own timetable and comfort has frustrated negotiators.\n\"If reciprocation is shown for North Korea's preemptive measures that have already been completed, he (Kim) strongly expressed his will that more active measures for North Korea's denuclearization can be taken,\" Chung said.\n\"The North Koreans are locked into a declaration to the end of the war, then end of sanctions, then denuclearization and dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons.\"\nJUST WATCHED New North Korea images spark concern Replay More Videos ...

There was at least one demonstrable outcome from this trip: a date for the next inter-Korean summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.\n\nIt's an auspicious time for the Hermit Kingdom. On Sunday it will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nTalks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled. President Trump canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's planned trip last month, citing little evidence that North Korea had come through on any of its commitments to denuclearize.\n\nThe task of bringing the two sides back together will again fall to President Moon, who has served as an intermediary, and who has made peace with the North his greatest mission as South Korea's leader.\n\nTime for Moon to make a play\n\nMoon will be coming into his summit with Kim ready to make a play, said Duyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n\"It's possible Moon will try to broker a trade off between Washington and Pyongyang that will involve a declaration that the war is over, and so the nuclear negotiations can move forward,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"The bottom line is that Pyongyang would have to take a genuine denuclearization step, not a symbolic one, that is convincing and acceptable enough for Washington to be able to continue its negotiations in a give and take fashion.\"\n\nShe suggests that in exchange for a declaration of an end to the Korean War, Kim immediately respond with an inventory of North Korea's arsenal -- something Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had tried to obtain when he visited Pyongyang in July, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nNorth Korea's reluctance to do anything outside of its own timetable and comfort has frustrated negotiators.\n\nRight now, argues David Maxwell, a retired US Army Special Forces colonel who served five tours on the Korean Peninsula, the White House has made a ton of concessions to Pyongyang and not gotten any credit for them.\n\n\"We suspended the military exercises and that's a significant blow to military readiness, and the North has not reciprocated,\" he told CNN. \"It's like with any blackmailer, you pay the ransom and they just want more and President Trump has got no credit for that because it's done, and this is a lesson we have to learn.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: no need for military exercises with South Korea Replay More Videos ...

Absent mechanisms for on the ground verification for inspectors, we cannot confirm that North Korea has taken any other denuclearization steps at this time,\" Coats said Tuesday. \"This North Korean commitment, and I put 'commitment' in parantheses -- to denuclearize presents a huge and critical challenge to our intelligence community -- complete and accurate collection and analyses is essential to achieve our long standing goals.\"\n\nCoats' comments exemplify the differences between the two nations regarding what each side considers to be active steps on the path to denuclearization. The US doesn't hold that many of the moves made by North Korea so far -- including the repatriation of fallen US troops , or the release of American detainees -- are connected with the nuclear issue.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump and Kim Jong Un's ups and downs Replay More Videos ...

I don't see that they've changed.\"\n\nBruce Bechtol, a professor of political science at Angelo State University, who has authored several books on North Korea, said that much depends on Moon regarding what happens next.\n\n\"Moon is a really enthusiastic guy for engagement with the North at all costs, with no cost to the North at least thus far,\" he told CNN. \"That's why we see all this stuff about them moving forward no matter what, even if the North Koreans violated the sanctions.\"\n\n\"I believe that no matter how the summit turns out, Moon will act as if this is a groundbreaking move.

There is still an armistice in place and such a declaration could not replace it, said Duyeon Kim.\n\n\"There's going to have to be a crystal clear agreement with Pyongyang and an understanding with Moscow and Beijing as well, that it doesn't alter the armistice. There can be no ambiguity for international lawyers,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"Or else Pyongyang, Beijing and Moscow could aim straight for the armistice to be abolished, and eventually get the UN command and the US troops out of the peninsula.

With more than 2 billion users worldwide, ferreting out bad actors is akin to finding a needle in a haystack, Gleicher told CNN during his first on-camera interview since taking the job in January. But he is determined to find it.\n\nSitting in one of the many buildings on Facebook's vast campus in Menlo Park, California, last week, Gleicher stressed the importance of getting it right.\n\n\"Public debate, open elections are the cornerstone of democracy,\" he told CNN. \"There's nothing more important than this. This is our highest priority and it's certainly my highest priority.\"\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the importance of the job that Facebook has entrusted to Gleicher and his team. The company has faced something of an existential crisis in the two years since Donald Trump won the presidency. The US intelligence community has made it clear that Russia exploited Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms in an elaborate campaign to sow discord in the United States and then attempt to sway the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAfter a few years of prosecuting cyber crimes at the Department of Justice, Gleicher served on President Obama's National Security Council. His previous work as a computer scientist and a lawyer gives him an advantage navigating the technology and political realms and helping those two worlds understand each other.\n\nGleicher said his biggest job at Facebook is bringing the company's security, policy, and legal teams together into a unified front against disinformation. \"There are a lot of different people from different places in the company that need to work together to combat this,\" he told CNN. In 2016, Facebook didn't take an integrated approach to combating disinformation. It's hoping that changing that will make a difference.\n\nLessons from 2016\n\nThe notion that Russian trolls could amass hundreds of thousands of American followers on Facebook, target them with ads, and pay for it all in rubles caught both tech companies like Facebook and even many in the US government unaware.\n\nGleicher has the advantage of having come aboard earlier this year, and therefore doesn't have to answer for the company's previous missteps.\n\nHe appears to have a firm understanding of the societal, political, and cultural implications of everything Facebook does. Despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strong performance during a congressional hearing in April, he has in the past come off unwilling or incapable of understanding the profound impact Facebook has on the world.\n\nIt didn't help that in the days after the 2016 presidential election Zuckerberg dismissed as \"crazy\" any suggestion that disinformation on Facebook could have swayed the election. He has since said he regrets making those comments, and the company has spent much of the past year trying to prove that it understands the problem.\n\nGleicher told CNN that although Facebook has always had a robust data security operation, it had until recently focused on \"traditional threats,\" like hackers stealing users' passwords. The company, he said, was not prepared for Russian manipulation of information on its platform.\n\n\"Information operations is a new kind of threat,\" he said. \"We have said that we weren't quick enough to identify this. We know that others have had a lot of trouble identifying this and identify these new types of threats.\"\n\nAs Gleicher pointed out, Facebook was not alone. The federal government was equally unprepared for the onslaught of bogus accounts and disinformation that plagued Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden once compared the intelligence community's missteps to the intelligence failures that led to the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Although the US government observed Russian disinformation campaigns on social media during the revolution in Ukraine in 2014 -- and even sent teams to that country to help counter them -- it didn't think such disinformation attempts would be effective against the US, Hayden told CNN earlier this year.\n\nPart of the challenge lies in the fact the federal government does not have a single agency responsible for tackling information warfare. Intelligence officials touted their coordinated approach to election security in a White House briefing last month, but it's too early to know how successful that effort has been.\n\nFacebook's move to coordinate its own efforts under Gleicher, though, has led to a few public wins.\n\nBad actors\n\nLate last month, Facebook announced that it had taken down 652 pages, accounts, and groups that it identified as part of a coordinated disinformation campaign that originated in Iran and targeted countries worldwide. It also found news pages connected to Russia.\n\nFacebook said the campaign originating in Iran included 254 Facebook pages and 116 Instagram accounts that together amassed more than 1 million followers. (Facebook owns Instagram.) Those responsible for creating the pages spent more than $12,000 on advertisements between 2012 and 2017, the company said.\n\nThat announcement came about a month after Facebook said that it had dismantled a network of accounts targeting Americans with disinformation and, in some cases, organizing political events in US cities. The company said it suspected those accounts originated in Russia, but could not prove it.\n\nFacebook's newly proactive and transparent approach to rooting out foreign meddling has earned cautious praise from some of the company's critics, including Senator Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Warner said last month he was \"encouraged to see Facebook taking steps to rid their platforms of these bad actors,\" but said much more work remains.\n\nAlthough the miscreants behind the campaign uncovered in July used tactics similar to those the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency employed in 2016, Gleicher told CNN that bad actors' efforts have grown more sophisticated. For example, the trolls used virtual private networks to mask their location and used cell phones that were not linked to a specific country. \"They were taking disciplined steps to make themselves harder to be identified,\" he said.\n\nFacebook and modern activism\n\nBalancing the need to eliminate disinformation with the desire to foster debate and discussion underscores one of the great challenges facing platforms. \"Once [disinformation campaigns are] found, society as a whole is faced with a choice,\" he said. \"How do you distinguish and how do you act on the nefarious, the inauthentic behavior, without also harming legitimate activism?\"\n\nAlthough Facebook's terms and conditions require users to provide their true identity in their profiles, Facebook users cannot see who is behind most of the pages they \"like.\" This anonymity protects activists who may legitimately fear for their safety, and was instrumental in social justice movements like the Arab Spring. But anonymity also allows organizations like the Internet Research Agency to do their work with near impunity.\n\n\"I would say anonymity is an essential component of public debate,\" Gleicher said. \"As we work on combating bad behaviors and bad actors in this way, we're continually thinking about, 'What are the consequences that this could have for advocates?' and 'How do we ensure that we're focused on the harmful actors and that we're not putting barriers in place that prevent advocates from engaging?'\"\n\nGleicher has been grappling with these issues for some time. A decade ago, when he was at Yale, he wrote an academic paper about the debate surrounding anonymous online speech.\n\n2020\n\nThe midterm elections are just two months away -- and 2020 lies beyond. Not everyone is convinced those elections can be safeguarded, and Gleicher would not rule out the possibility that Facebook will dismantle still more foreign disinformation campaigns in the weeks ahead.\n\nBut he remains cautiously hopeful that Facebook's efforts, coupled with similar steps by other platforms, independent researchers, and government agencies could help prevent a repeat of 2016. It's an unenviable task, and Gleicher concedes it will not be easy. \"There are,\" he said, \"no silver bullets here.\"\n\nCorrection: This story previously misstated how long Gleicher was a prosecutor before joining the White House."}{"id": 64, "name": "Bitcoin bloodbath: Cryptocurrency plunges 20% in two days", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/06/technology/bitcoin-prices-plunging-goldman-sachs/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "A report saying that Goldman Sachs was scaling back on plans for a bitcoin trading desk sparked a major pullback across the cryptocurrency world.", "keywords": ["days", "bloodbath", "investors", "cryptocurrencies", "plunges", "bitcoin", "company", "cryptocurrency", "digital", "goldman", "blockchain", "sachs", "told", "trading", "20"], "summary": "A Business Insider report that investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) may be dropping plans to launch a crypto trading desk.\nGoldman Sachs told CNNMoney though that it hadn't made a firm decision about bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies just yet.\nBut if Goldman Sachs is pulling back, that is not good news.\nGoldman Sachs confirmed in May that it was thinking of using its own money to start trading bitcoin, according to the New York Times.\nSo it might make sense for Goldman Sachs to take a more cautious approach to this extremely volatile market.", "content": "Bitcoin investors are getting their digital butts kicked lately.

Overstock (OSTK) has de-emphasized much of its struggling online retail business to focus on cryptocurrencies.\n\nBioptix, a maker of hormones for farm animals, changed its name to Riot Blockchain (RIOT). The stock surged -- until the company disclosed the SEC was probing it.\n\nBeverage company Long Island Iced Tea morphed into Long Blockchain (LBCC). It's since been delisted by the Nasdaq and now trades as a so-called bulletin board stock at a price below 20 cents a share.\n\nSome companies also began selling digital tokens through initial coin offerings to raise money.\n\nEastman Kodak (KODK)-- yes, the camera and film company -- created its own KodakCoin. There's even a PotCoin for the legal marijuana and cannabis industry.\n\nMany of these initial coin offerings are legitimate. But there have been scams too. The SEC even created a fake ICO called HoweyCoins to show how easy it is for investors to get duped.\n\nAnd several titans of business have blasted bitcoin as well.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a \"fraud\" that was only good for drug dealers and North Korea.\n\nBillionaire investor Saudi Prince Alwaleed, whose Kingdom Holding Company owns stakes in Apple (AAPL), Citigroup (C) and Twitter (TWTR), told CNBC late last year he thought bitcoin was an \"Enron in the making\" that will implode.\n\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) have also warned investors to stay away from bitcoin.\n\nBuffett told CNBC in early May bitcoin was \"probably rat poison squared\" while Munger said at the Berkshire shareholder meeting that the thought of owning cryptocurrencies was \"just dementia.\"\n\nIt's also worth noting that the recent plunge in bitcoin comes at a time when the Turkish lira, Indian rupee and Argentine peso are in freefall mode as the dollar strengthens.\n\nSo investors don't seem to be willing to bet on bitcoin as a replacement for fragile emerging markets currencies.\n\nStill, the pullback in bitcoin comes even as more and more businesses and organizations have embraced blockchain technology, the digital ledger that keeps records of transactions in virtual currencies.\n\nIBM (IBM) is a big proponent of the blockchain. The World Bank has announced plans to launch a blockchain bond. There's even a company that wants to run a fantasy football league using blockchain. (Call me old school. But I'll stick with Yahoo for my league.)\n\nThere is a clear difference between bitcoin and blockchain. The future of money may still very well be digital, but that doesn't mean that bitcoin or the scores of other virtual currencies out there will all survive and thrive.\n\n-- CNNMoney's Julia Horowitz contributed to this report."}{"id": 65, "name": "Here's why Amazon may beat Apple to $2 trillion", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/05/news/companies/amazon-apple-2-trillion/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-05T00:00:00", "description": "One Wall Street analyst thinks Amazon's cloud dominance gives Amazon an edge over Apple.

Last year it bought Whole Foods, and it recently bought online pharmacy Pillpack. Some rumors say Amazon may want to move even further into the media business and buy the Landmark movie theater chain.\n\nAnd Forte thinks there are two other areas of retail that could also help lift the Jeff Bezos-led company to a $2 trillion market cap: gas stations and travel.\n\nGoing after Costco and Priceline?\n\nForte argued in a recent report that Amazon could emulate the model of Costco (COST), which owns and operates gas stations at some of its giant warehouse stores.\n\nHe added that the company could offer discounts on fuel to lure drivers who are also Amazon Prime subscribers.\n\nBut it's not clear how Amazon would enter the gas station business.

But its Amazon Destinations site lasted only a few months in 2015 before being shut down.\n\nForte thinks that Amazon could try again, and offer services ranging from discounts on cruises and rental cars to airline tickets and hotel reservations.

As for why he owns Amazon but not Apple, Benkendorf said \"there are questions about Apple's sustainability of growth.\"\n\nWall Street agrees.\n\nAmazon's profits are expected to rise at a much more rapid clip than Apple's.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting average annual earnings growth of 46% for Amazon over the next five years, compared with estimates of just 13% growth annually for Apple."}{"id": 66, "name": "Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reflects on one year at the company", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/29/technology/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-one-year-anniversary/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-08-29T00:00:00", "description": "In an interview with CNNMoney, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi discusses his first year leading the company, and looks towards its future.", "keywords": ["khosrowshahi", "reflects", "things", "ubers", "point", "regulators", "company", "dara", "companys", "cities", "uber", "ceo", "work"], "summary": "Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi doesn't believe in regrets, but as he looks back on his first year leading the company, he sees one thing he'd like to have changed more quickly.\nArguably the most pressing task Khosrowshahi faced was reshaping the company culture and abolishing Kalanick's anything-goes, growth-at-all-costs ethos.\nIt first partnered with Uber in 2015 but cut ties with the company during the company's turmoil in 2017 under Kalanick's leadership.\nIn April, when Uber released its latest diversity report, Khosrowshahi stressed that the company needed to hone in on hiring or promoting more diverse leadership.\nUnder Khosrowshahi, Uber has expanded beyond its core ride-hailing service into other modes of transportation like bikes and scooters.", "content": "Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi doesn't believe in regrets, but as he looks back on his first year leading the company, he sees one thing he'd like to have changed more quickly.\n\nUber's corporate culture was in dire need of an overhaul when Khosrowshahi took the job. He's made progress, but in an interview with CNNMoney ahead of his one-year anniversary as chief executive, Khosrowshahi said, \"If there's one area that I would have liked to change faster, it is to execute more fully on our cultural transformation as a company internally, across all levels at the company.\"\n\n\"It will never be done,\" he said. \"It's a continuous exercise. If I talk to you next year, I hope to be further along on the exercise than I am right now.\"\n\nIt was one year ago Monday that word leaked that Khosrowshahi was leaving a comfy gig as the head of Expedia to lead what was at the time the most dysfunctional company in tech. Founder and CEO Travis Kalanick had made such a mess of things that the board finally pushed him out four months after harassment and sexism allegations rocked the company.\n\nKhosrowshahi arrived to his first official day of work on September 5 with a daunting to-do list. Uber faced a slew of sexual harassment and gender discrimination allegations. It was embroiled in a messy lawsuit with Waymo. Several executive roles were vacant, its drivers were on the verge of revolt and its losses were widening.\n\nKhosrowshahi told CNNMoney the past year has been such a whirlwind that it feels like he's celebrating his one-month anniversary, not marking the passage of an entire year.\n\n\"It's been filled with good days and bad days,\" he said. \"The good news is that the good days are outnumbering the bad days more recently. But I didn't get into this expecting an easy ride. It's been just as challenging as I expected.\"\n\nArguably the most pressing task Khosrowshahi faced was reshaping the company culture and abolishing Kalanick's anything-goes, growth-at-all-costs ethos. He said Uber has made \"enormous strides\" when it comes to its attitude towards dealing with regulators, for example.\n\nEarly on in his tenure, he revamped the company's cultural norms, ditching attitudes like \"Always Be Hustlin\" and \"Superpumped\" in favor of things like \"Customer Obsessed\" and \"We Do The Right Thing.\"\n\nRelated: Wanna bike instead? Uber is cool with that\n\n\"We haven't made those norms an everyday reality at all levels of the company and while we've seen progress, it's not a job done,\" he said.\n\nUnderscoring that point was the departure in July of Uber's head of human resources, Liane Hornsey, following an internal investigation into how she handled claims of racial discrimination within the company. In her goodbye email to staff, Hornsey didn't address the probe. Uber confirmed an investigation, but would not elaborate on the claims against her.\n\nAnd several employees have raised concerns about Chief Operating Officer Barney Harford for alleged racially insensitive comments. Harford, who worked with Khosrowshahi at Expedia, remains at Uber. In a memo to coworkers shared with CNNMoney in July, Harford described allegations as \"painful\" and said he was \"embarrassed.\" He pledged to work with a coach who could challenge his \"blind spots.\"\n\nSuch things leave some of Uber's critics skeptical of any claims that Khosrowshahi has made enough of an impact. \"We've been very critical of Uber and we maintain that position,\" Brenda Darden Wilkerson, president and CEO of AnitaB.org, previously known as Anita Borg Institute, told CNNMoney.\n\nAnitaB.org puts on the annual Grace Hopper Conference, the largest gathering of women in computing. It also partners with more than 70 companies on recruiting practices, keeping women in tech, and creating an inclusive workforce.\n\nIt first partnered with Uber in 2015 but cut ties with the company during the company's turmoil in 2017 under Kalanick's leadership.\n\nWilkerson credits Khosrowshahi with taking some critical steps, including hiring the company's first diversity and inclusion officer and achieving gender and racial pay equity.\n\nRelated: Uber finally hires a chief financial officer as it preps for IPO\n\nUber re-evaluated employee salaries after bonuses were paid out in March to ensure all employees -- regardless of gender or race -- are paid equally based on their location, job and tenure in the role.\n\nIn April, when Uber released its latest diversity report, Khosrowshahi stressed that the company needed to hone in on hiring or promoting more diverse leadership.\n\nUber has also agreed to a $10 million settlement over harassment and discrimination claims by female and minority engineers earlier this year.\n\nCultural change isn't the only ongoing challenge for Khosrowshahi. He still has to confront safety issues and a growing wave of regulatory battles, as well as continue his effort to diversify Uber's business ahead of an anticipated 2019 IPO.\n\nRegulatory challenges pose a significant threat to the company's growth. London threatened not to renew Uber's license to operate, only to relent when Khosrowshahi made several concessions, including sharing the company's traffic data. More significantly, Khosrowshahi admitted to past mistakes and shortcomings -- something Kalanick wasn't known for.\n\n\"He went almost deferentially down that second route,\" Tony Travers, a government professor at the London School of Economics, told CNNMoney.\n\nKhosrowshahi stressed that the first step to dealing with cities and regulators is \"getting in the room and having a dialogue. We're having a continuing dialogue with really all the cities that we operate with, and the regulators we operate with.\"\n\n\"We want to be seen as a partner that's part of the solution,\" he added.\n\nRelated: Uber will no longer force victims of sexual assault into arbitration\n\nThat didn't work so well in New York. Earlier this month, the city, Uber's largest US market, adopted a temporary cap on the number of new for-hire vehicle licenses as it explores ways of reducing traffic congestion. The legislation could encourage other cities to follow suit as they attempt to rein in ridesharing firms believed to have increased congestion even as they've revolutionized transportation.\n\n\"We don't think the City Council came to the right conclusion but at this point, we're not going to dwell on that,\" said Khosrowshahi.\n\nBradley Tusk, an Uber investor and former regulatory adviser to the company, said Khosrowshahi's conflict avoidance approach \"made the New York loss all but inevitable,\" telling CNNMoney it could be \"sign of political trouble to come.\"\n\n\"They ran a very risk averse, tepid campaign that didn't engender any anger but also had no chance of winning,\" he added, while stating that Khosrowshahi has done a good job of \"generally calming things down.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi stressed that the company will continue working to improve experiences for drivers and riders in New York and to ensure that its service is accessible and available to customers who don't have access to mass transit. Pushing customers to use alternate modes of transportation is also a way of ingratiating the company with cities and regulators: It could help cut down on traffic congestion.\n\nUnder Khosrowshahi, Uber has expanded beyond its core ride-hailing service into other modes of transportation like bikes and scooters.\n\nRelated: Uber now monitors drivers for criminal offenses in real time\n\n\"Uber is not a one-note company. We're a selection of different businesses, with different maturities and growth profiles,\" he said. \"We want to be your everyday use case for getting from point A to point B.\"\n\nUber carved out a \"new modalities\" unit earlier this summer. The department includes the alternative offerings Uber has in store. Uber launched an electric bike option in San Francisco in February, and has since expanded the offering to a handful of other American cities. In April, it acquired electric bike-share startup Jump Bikes. E-scooters are also coming to the Uber app in San Francisco, as well as other cities. It also plans to integrate city bus and subway systems into its app.\n\nUber's new CFO, Nelson Chai, will be tasked with continuing to grow the company's core ridesharing business as well as its \"big bold bets,\" into which scooters and bikes fall. While they may take \"years to mature\" and may suffer losses in the near term, they will bring in \"billions of revenue at maturity,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"The focus and the weight of our efforts is going to be around innovation -- but not innovation for a wonderful prototype but innovation for scale.\"\n\n\"We've got a ton of work ahead of us,\" he added. \"I think we can say that one year later, Uber is on much more solid ground.\""}{"id": 67, "name": "Why men may exaggerate number of sex partners", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/health/number-of-sex-partners-kerner/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "Men are more likely than women to inflate their number of opposite-sex partners, possibly because men estimate rather than count all of their partners.", "keywords": ["sexual", "sex", "partners", "exaggerate", "numbers", "women", "ask", "partner", "therapist", "number", "men"], "summary": "For one recent survey study , researchers at the University of Glasgow analyzed the responses of over 15,000 men and women and concluded that men are more likely to exaggerate their number of opposite-sex partners, possibly because men estimate rather than count all of their partners.\nMen, it turned out, claimed an average of 14 sexual partners over their lifetime, while women reported only seven.\n\"This seems to indicate that the number of sex partners would be especially skewed in the male population in favor of the more desirable men and that a majority of men are not having much success,\" sex therapist Michael Aaron said.\n\"I find that more men ask this question of their female partners than vice versa,\" sex therapist Deborah Fox noted.\nAnd while you should certainly ask about your partner's sexual health -- and get tested -- the number of sexual partners you've both had shouldn't affect the need to practice safe sex.", "content": "(CNN) When it comes to sexual partners, what's in a number? For one recent survey study , researchers at the University of Glasgow analyzed the responses of over 15,000 men and women and concluded that men are more likely to exaggerate their number of opposite-sex partners, possibly because men estimate rather than count all of their partners.\n\nMen, it turned out, claimed an average of 14 sexual partners over their lifetime, while women reported only seven. The people surveyed were between the ages of 16 and 74.\n\nThe investigators claim that such studies are an important part of human sexuality research and in assessing the risk of sexually transmitted infections. But my fellow sex therapists and I aren't so sure. Rather than focusing on one's number of partners, \"We should be talking about what folks want for their future and what they've learned from past relationships,\" sex therapist Gracie Landes said.\n\nI asked Landes and several of my other colleagues to weigh in on the continued fascination that the public -- and media -- seems to have with people's number of sexual partners.\n\nAre men exaggerating or overestimating their number of partners?\n\nThe answer to this question appears to be a resounding \"yes.\" Indeed, it's simple math: \"Given that there are not significantly more women in the population than men, if men are reporting higher numbers and women are reporting lower numbers, many are reporting inflated or deflated numbers due to the tendency to answer questions in a way that they think they're supposed to,\" sex therapist Dulcinea Pitagora explained.\n\nIn fact, statistics released by the dating app Tinder show that men use a broader strategy, indicating their approval of someone's photo by swiping right on 46% of profiles, while women swipe right on only 14%. A study of raw data from Tinder also found that about 80% of female users are all competing for the same 20% of men.\n\n\"This seems to indicate that the number of sex partners would be especially skewed in the male population in favor of the more desirable men and that a majority of men are not having much success,\" sex therapist Michael Aaron said. \"It's possible, then, that surveys such as this one, which find higher overall partners amongst men, may be indicative of men inflating their numbers, perhaps due to underlying shame.\"\n\nWhy would someone inflate or deflate their actual number?\n\nAs Aaron suggests, society's focus on the number of people someone has slept with may lead some to exaggerate -- or decrease -- their actual number out of embarrassment.\n\n\"Women might underreport out of fear of being judged negatively, while men might overreport in order to be looked at more favorably,\" sex therapist Rachel Needle said. \"In other words, men who have a high number are considered studs, while women are often slut-shamed. In addition, women might round down so their partner feels more important and special.\"\n\nSex therapist Barbara Gold agreed. \"I believe this is attributable to shame. It goes back to the gender myths that women aren't supposed to enjoy or expose their sexuality lest they be judged in a negative way, while whatever sexual shame men may carry, social norms not only allow them to be sexual creatures but expect them to be,\" she explained.\n\nShould you ask your partner their 'number' -- or tell them yours?\n\nWhether you choose to talk numbers with your partner is entirely up to you. \"You should do whatever you're comfortable with,\" Gold said. \"You might ask why they want to know and what the number represents to them and then decide if or how you want to respond.\"\n\n\"I find that more men ask this question of their female partners than vice versa,\" sex therapist Deborah Fox noted. \"Although men make some meaning out of the number they receive, it's not really the question they want an answer to. They really want to know how they stack up to the previous partners, but that question requires way more nerve to ask. They want to know, 'Am I the best lover you've ever had?' but they're also unlikely to ask that question.\"\n\nWhat should couples be discussing instead?\n\nRather than fixating on the number of people you or your partner have had sex with, I advise turning the conversation so that you're having an open discussion about your interests.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Instead of discussing a number, you should be talking about what you know you enjoy sexually, what you're curious about and what you might want to explore in terms of sensations, types or scenarios, monogamy/non-monogamy and your top erotic triggers,\" sex therapist Sari Cooper said.\n\nAnd while you should certainly ask about your partner's sexual health -- and get tested -- the number of sexual partners you've both had shouldn't affect the need to practice safe sex.\n\nIt can be tempting to focus on one's number of sexual partners, and studies like this one allow curious folks to compare themselves to others. But the fact is that there's no right or wrong number. What matters most is your relationship with your current partner and how you can both make that as satisfying as possible."}{"id": 68, "name": "More baby boomers turning to marijuana, study says", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/health/baby-boomers-marijuana-study/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "Seniors are increasingly passing the pipe.

About 9% of US adults between the ages of 50 and 64 have used marijuana at least once during the survey year, while 3% of those over 65 have done so, new research finds.\n\nFor middle-age adults, the percentage of cannabis users has doubled over nearly a decade, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence. Older adults have seen a seven-fold increase in that period.\n\nThough marijuana use is increasing among older Americans, \"most of these people are not first-time users,\" said Joseph Palamar, senior study author and an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at New York University Langone Medical Center.\n\n\"I don't think we need to worry about millions of older people trying weed for the first time,\" he said. \"At least not yet.\"\n\n'High rates of unhealthy substance use'\n\nPalamar examined data from 17,608 adults 50 and older who took the National Survey on Drug Use and Health . The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has conducted this survey each year since 1971 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nParticipants answer questions about their tobacco, alcohol and drug use in addition to providing demographic information and details about their health.\n\nAnalyzing survey data from 2015-16 and 2006-07, the researchers compared marijuana users and non-users within and across age groups both past and present.\n\nPrevalence of past-year marijuana use was 9% among middle-age adults and 2.9% among older adults, and past-month use prevalence was 5.7% among middle-age adults and 1.7% among older adults, according to the report.\n\n\"We found high rates of unhealthy substance use (tobacco, alcohol, prescription drug misuse) by middle-aged and older adults who use marijuana,\" Dr. Benjamin Han, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at the New York University School of Medicine, wrote in an email.\n\nFor example, the study shows that nearly 5% of middle-age marijuana users had alcohol use problems, 9% depended on nicotine, and 3.5% misused opioids; among older adults, 1.5% had alcohol use problems, 3.5% depended on nicotine, and 1.2% misused opioids.\n\nIn addition to opioids, past-year marijuana users were more likely to misuse sedatives and tranquilizers than their peers, according to the report.\n\nHan said that \"polysubstance use\" or the \"use of multiple substances, especially unhealthy use, is particularly risky for older adults with chronic diseases.\" Marijuana may intensify symptoms of existing conditions while interacting with prescribed medications.\n\nPalamar noted that \"depending on the drugs combined, the effects can be much stronger.\"\n\n\"Combining marijuana with alcohol can really knock someone on their ass if they weren't expecting such strong effects,\" he said.\n\nHealth and legal risks\n\nBaby boomers have more experience with marijuana than previous generations, the study authors said. More than half (almost 55%) of middle-age adults have used marijuana at some point in their lives, while over a fifth (about 22%) of older adults have done so, Han and Palamar found.\n\nWith a growing number of states legalizing medical and recreational marijuana, health care professionals find themselves in a bind, Han said.\n\n\"I get asked more and more by older patients if they should try marijuana, mostly for sleep or pain,\" said Han, who practices geriatric medicine. \"Marijuana may be therapeutically useful for a variety of symptoms and medical conditions, but the research in this area is extremely limited.\"\n\nMore research is needed to define risks and benefits of using marijuana in these age groups while providing more information about safety, dosing, method of use (inhalation or ingestion) and symptoms, Han said.\n\nFor now, though, it is \"hard for us as providers to recommend it aside for very specific clinical indications (especially compared to well-studied other options),\" Han wrote. \"Especially if we do not fully understand its risks for older adults or those with multiple chronic medical conditions.\"\n\nAnother concern? Baby boomers face \"potential legal risks of use if they live in a state where marijuana is illegal,\" Palamar said.\n\nOpposite ends of the spectrum\n\nChristopher P. Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Social Work, said the new study provides \"high-quality information\" that is essential in a time when public opinion and policies related to marijuana are changing rapidly.\n\nThat said, a number of \"credible studies\" already provide \"compelling evidence that marijuana use has increased meaningfully among adults in general , and among middle-aged and older adults in particular, over the last 10 to 15 years,\" said Salas-Wright, who was not involved in the new study but has published research on the topic.\n\nIt's not only use but problem use of marijuana that has increased among adults in these age groups, he said.\n\nAlthough many baby boomers \"likely use marijuana without experiencing any serious problems\" -- the same as alcohol -- \"we should not lose sight of the fact that marijuana is a psychoactive drug\" and so poses the \"risk of adverse consequences,\" Salas-Wright said.\n\nIn a national study published in 2015, Salas-Wright showed \"that rates of marijuana use declined slightly among youth ages 12 to 14 and have remained flat among those ages 15 to 17 since 2002.\"\n\nBaby boomers turning to cannabis, then, is happening alongside a decline in drug use and other risky behaviors among teens, Salas-Wright noted.\n\nThough the new study makes an \"incremental contribution\" to science, Namkee Choi, a professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Austin, said that a different kind of marijuana study is needed today.\n\nChoi, who did not participate in the new research, said a 2017 report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine \"summarizes very well how little scientific evidence we have so far about marijuana's effects on health and mental health in adulthood.\"\n\n\"We know more about marijuana's negative effects during formative years,\" said Choi, who has published extensive research on cannabis' effects . \"More research is needed to evaluate marijuana's beneficial and negative effects on health and mental health for all age groups and effective treatment modalities for marijuana use disorder.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHan said the number of baby boomers using weed will probably continue to grow due to changing laws. Because risky drug use could become a problem for some, he suggests that health care providers screen middle-age and older patients for substance use."}
