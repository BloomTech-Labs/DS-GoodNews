The truth is all the denials bring us no closer to finding out who actually wrote the piece. ( I speculated about 13 possible culprits here .)\n\nBut if you are a newspaper/sourcing nerd -- and I am! -- there is something that can be gained by a) digging into the way that the Times described the writer and b) understanding the Times' calculus in publishing the piece at all.\n\nThe writer was described by the Times as a \"senior official in the Trump administration,\" which is, obviously, very, very broad. There are thousands of people within the federal bureaucracy and God knows everyone thinks they are a senior official, too. (If there is anyone below you on the totem pole, they would be a junior administration official, so you could tell yourself you are a senior administration official.)\n\nThe other complicating factor, as noted by CNN's own Betsy Klein , is that there is no title of \"senior administration official\" within the federal government. Describing someone with that moniker is a function of an agreement between the media organization and the source. The relative senior-ness of the administration official is in the eye of the beholder -- a beholder named The New York Times, in this case.\n\n\"All I can say is I feel that we follow a definition that's been used by our newsroom in the past,\" said Jim Dao, the Times op-ed editor, in a conversation on \"The Daily\" podcast Thursday.\n\nWhere does that leave us? Almost nowhere. Except that you have to know this about The New York Times: They aren't publishing an anonymous op-ed from just anyone in the Trump administration. They especially aren't publishing one that alleges a near-coup within the federal government among people concerned the President is not only hopelessly out of his depth but also clueless about how hopelessly out of his depth he actually is.\n\nIn short: If some midlevel bureaucrat in the Trump administration comes to the Times -- or has an intermediary reach out to the Times -- asking to write a piece like this one without their name attached to it, the answer would be an immediate \"no.\" Contrary to what Trump says on his Twitter feed, media organizations are very wary of giving anyone and everyone anonymity to make attacks. Reporters push sources to put their names on quotes or at a minimum to narrow the anonymous descriptions to show as much of who these people are (and why they are saying what they are saying) as possible to the reader. Media organizations -- the credible ones at least -- are hugely averse to letting people take potshots without their names attached to it.\n\nGiven all of that, it's telling that the Times was willing to extend the cloak of anonymity to this author -- especially, again, because of the stakes and the target. This is not a decision made lightly. That the decision was made to publish it should tell you that this isn't some disgruntled mid-to-upper manager buried in the bureaucracy. This is a genuine high-ranking official. A name most people who follow politics -- and maybe some who don't -- would recognize. The Times simply wouldn't do what it did for anything short of a major figure in Trump world.", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 2, "name": "Corker on NYT op-ed: Who wouldn't write it?", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/06/corker-reax-nty-oped-trump-gop-lead-sot-vxp.cnn", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "Sen.

View more opinion articles on CNN.com.\n\n(CNN) What do you do when your boss is dangerously unstable, often clueless and, oh yes ... the President of the United States?\n\nOne senior administration official resolved that question Wednesday by unburdening himself -- or herself -- on the op-ed page of The New York Times, describing a \"resistance\" within the upper echelons of the Trump administration that has acted to protect the country from an unmoored President.\n\nThe author suggested that Trump-appointed Cabinet members even discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment, declaring him unfit and removing him from office. Instead, the author said, they resolved to rein in the volcanic President from the inside.\n\nThe timing of the piece, coming a day after excerpts were released from Bob Woodward's new investigative tome, \"Fear: Trump in the White House,\" deepened the portrait of an ignorant and amoral President whose escalator isn't stopping at every floor.\n\nThe question I keep asking is: What exactly was its intended purpose?\n\nWas it to embolden a GOP-led Congress, currently in the President's thrall, to provide greater oversight?\n\nWas it to warn voters that he's an erratic and dangerous dolt in advance of the critical midterm elections, with the expectation that a Democratic Congress will provide the oversight the Republicans have not?\n\nWas this merely the work of someone who, after nearly two years in the White House of Horrors, felt the need to unburden himself -- or herself -- and bear witness to the disturbing things they had seen.\n\nOr was it meant to defend the honor of those, like the author, who have decided to stay, despite deep misgivings and fears about the President? This, it seems, is the most logical and understandable explanation for taking this extraordinary step.\n\nBut if your resolve is to stay inside and quietly work to help rein in Trump's excesses, wouldn't it have been more effective to suffer in silence a while longer rather than poking an already raging bear?\n\nThe essay predictably infuriated Trump and his supporters. \"TREASON?\" the President thundered through his favorite medium, as his aides launched their own witch hunt to identify the offender in their midst. (Good luck with that. Like \"Murder on the Orient Express,\" the list of suspects is voluminous.)\n\nThe President also hurled yet another assault at one of his favorite targets, the Times, for publishing the piece, going so far as to suggest the renegade author was the paper's fictitious invention.\n\nOf course, the Times editors know the identity of the author and, as with any unnamed source, ran the piece only after judging him or her credible. This wasn't treason or fakery. It was journalism.\n\nJUST WATCHED Cuomo slams Trump's response to NYT op-ed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cuomo slams Trump's response to NYT op-ed 04:10\n\nThe high-ranking whistleblower also came in for criticism from some opponents of the President for hiding behind anonymity instead of quitting and for failing to act on the 25th Amendment (instead of \"whisper\" about it, as the op-ed writer put it), which could be invoked to remove an unhinged commander in chief.\n\nWe shouldn't minimize the fear the author shared about tearing the country apart by precipitously triggering a rare provision of the Constitution to strip an elected President of his authority -- despite the risk of a reckless Trump.\n\nAs Trump's fire and fury grows, we may be headed for a reckoning in open proceedings before the courts and the Congress. Most important, there will be a reckoning at the polls this November and two years from now. An act of the Cabinet behind closed doors to decommission Trump -- if this was truly considered -- would have been greeted by his supporters as a bloodless coup. On this, I am sympathetic with the whistleblower's concern.\n\nThe Times piece was stunning and, like so much in the world of Trump, wholly unprecedented. The observations of the anonymous author certainly ring true. They are consistent with Woodward's findings about the President's erratic behavior and plenty of other reporting that has been done about it over the past two years.\n\nYet, at the end of the day, I still find myself wondering: If the game plan is to stay in place and continue to act as a guardrail, why write the piece at all?", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 4, "name": "Cuomo: Why fuss if op-ed is meaningless?", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/07/trump-nyt-op-ed-white-house-officials-cuomo-closing-cpt-vpx.cnn", "timestamp": "2018-09-07T00:00:00", "description": "CNN's Chris Cuomo poses questions to the New York Times op-ed author written by an anonymous senior administration official.", "keywords": ["happening", "fuss", "chat", "world", "cuomo", "unfolds", "whats", "messenger", "oped", "meaningless", "facebook"], "summary": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.\nFind out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous,\" the unnamed senior administration official wrote. \"But we believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic. That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office.\"\n\nIt is impossible to quantify the efforts of that quiet resistance. When asked to share examples of efforts to frustrate Trump's more rash decisions, one former senior administration official told CNN: \"That's a daily occurrence. Literally multiple times a day.\"\n\nBut there are several illustrative examples, listed here:\n\nEvacuating of military families from South Korea\n\nJust weeks before the Winter Olympics in South Korea that served as a critical diplomatic opening with Pyongyang, Trump ordered his top national security officials to prepare to evacuate the families of all US military personnel living in South Korea, four current and former administration officials told CNN.\n\nThe order was a provocative step that would have heightened tensions with North Korea and could have sent the region spiraling closer to war because North Korea could have interpreted the move as the US preparing to strike North Korea.\n\nThen-national security adviser H.R. McMaster directed National Security Council staff to prepare a presidential memorandum ordering the evacuation.\n\nBut behind the scenes, Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly worked to kill the order, convincing Trump to agree to a scaled-down directive. But that too was never implemented.\n\nFiring Mueller\n\nTrump ordered the White House counsel Don McGahn in June 2017 to direct the firing of the special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nMcGahn refused to carry out the order, though, threatening to resign instead. Trump ultimately dropped the issue, a source told CNN in January, confirming reporting from The New York Times\n\nPulling out of the US-South Korea free trade deal\n\nA letter announcing the United States' intent to pull out of KORUS, the free trade deal between the US and South Korea, was on Trump's desk in September 2017, ready for his signature.\n\nBut, according to Woodward's new book, \"Fear,\" the President's then-top economic adviser Gary Cohn stepped in and swiped the letter from Trump's desk -- and Trump's desire to withdraw from the trade deal ultimately subsided.\n\nThe trade deal was ultimately renegotiated and Trump has touted the renegotiated agreement as one of his top accomplishments in office.\n\nWithdrawing from NAFTA\n\nLater that year, Trump decided he also wanted to simply withdraw from NAFTA, directing his then-staff secretary Rob Porter to draft a letter notifying his intention to pull the US out of the trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico, according to Woodward's book.\n\nPorter drafted the letter, but consulted Cohn and other officials about how to stop Trump from taking a step they feared would rattle the global economy and the US relationship with its two neighboring countries.\n\n\"I can stop this. I'll just take the paper off his desk,\" Cohn told Porter, according to Woodward's book.\n\nThe US has now reached a preliminary agreement with Mexico on renegotiating NAFTA and is in the midst of negotiations with Canada.\n\nImposing steel and aluminum tariffs\n\nOn this one, Trump ultimately prevailed -- imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, albeit ultimately carving out a few exceptions.\n\nBut for months, Trump's globalist-minded economic advisers including Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin thwarted Trump's repeated direction to draw up tariff actions he could take, including on steel and aluminum imports.\n\nTrump ultimately announced he was moving forward with those tariffs in March, but in the summer of 2017, Cohn and Mnuchin convinced Trump imposing the tariffs could threaten support for the tax reform effort they were leading on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd when the tax reform legislation passed, they pivoted their arguments: telling Trump the tariffs would undermine the record-high stock market figures Trump so frequently touted, three sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nExpelling Russian diplomats\n\nIt's not always about the actions officials have prevented Trump from taking. As the unnamed official wrote in The New York Times, some officials have also sought to push through actions that may be at odds with Trump's public positions.\n\n\"The result is a two-track presidency,\" the official wrote in the Times.\n\nTrump's aides convinced him in March to sign off on the expulsion of 60 suspected Russian spies working in the US on diplomatic cover, in response to the suspected Russian nerve agent poisoning of a double agent on British soil.\n\nTrump signed off because he believed he was matching the number of Russian officials individual US allies were expelling.\n\nBut when he found out other countries had ousted roughly as many Russian officials as the sum total of other US allies, he was enraged, The Washington Post reported at the time . A senior administration official also confirmed Trump's anger about the move to CNN.\n\n2018 NATO summit\n\nSimilarly, senior US officials rushed to complete a joint communique to be issued during the NATO summit this summer before Trump arrived in Brussels for the annual meeting, The New York Times reported\n\nJohn Bolton, the recently installed national security adviser, pushed to seal the communique ahead of the summit, securing key commitments from the US about the military alliance before Trump could threaten to upend those very pledges, according to the Times.\n\nArriving at NATO, Trump would nonetheless vaguely threaten the US departure from NATO unless NATO allies committed to additional spending and called an emergency session to discuss the issue of burden-sharing on the final day of the summit. But the communique had already published a day earlier, committing the US to the alliance and its future growth.\n\nAssad's assassination\n\nWoodward reported in his new book that Trump called Defense Secretary Jim Mattis after Syrian chemical weapons attacks in April 2017 and said: \"Let's f***ing kill him! Let's go in. Let's kill the f***ing lot of them.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Mattis told an aide: \"We're not going to do any of that. We're going to be much more measured.\"\n\nUltimately, the US would launch military strikes against several Syrian government targets but would take no action on assassinating Assad -- which would have marked a major escalation of the US response.\n\nMattis denied making contemptuous remarks that were also attributed to him in Woodward's book, but he did not specifically deny the anecdote about Assad.\n\nTrump denied ever ordering or considering ordering the assassination of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad when he was pressed Wednesday about the allegation, which is included in Woodward's book.\n\n\"I heard somewhere where they said the assassination of President Assad by the United States. Never even discussed,\" Trump said.", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 7, "name": "Live: Obama gives 'State of our Democracy' speech", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/obama-state-of-our-democracy-09-07-2018/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-07T15:57:47+00:00", "description": "President Barack Obama is stepping back into the political fray Friday with a speech on the \"State of our Democracy.\" See live updates.", "keywords": ["democratic", "voidobama", "vacuum", "obama", "speech", "progress", "obamas", "president", "democracy", "gives", "state", "voted", "backlash", "live"], "summary": "President Barack Obama will step back into the political fray Friday, delivering a speech that will preview his 2018 midterm election message and provide his most pointed rebuke to date of President Donald Trump.\nAnd we didn't get here overnight,\" an Obama aide said.\n\"People in power want us to believe that the rest of us are powerless to solve our problems through democracy.\nAnd when people stop showing up, like in 2010 and 2014 where fewer people voted, a vacuum forms, and a politics of fear and resentment fills that void.\"\nObama and Trump have not talked since the inauguration, a source tells CNN.", "content": "President Barack Obama will step back into the political fray Friday, delivering a speech that will preview his 2018 midterm election message and provide his most pointed rebuke to date of President Donald Trump.\n\nOne theme of Obama's speech at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will be how the history of the United States has always been progress and \"backlash to progress,\" and the former President will argue the country is currently in one of those backlash moments.\n\n\"We're in one of those moments of backlash.

Dalia said she paid people to help get her and her son to the US.\n\n\"Days and nights in a bus, we slept hidden in the mountains,\" she said. They went \"entire days without eating, with my son, crammed in buses without seats .... with 65 people all on top of each other.\"\n\nAlejandro gets emotional when recalling that journey.\n\n\"We endured hunger. We endured cold. We endured thirst,\" the boy said.\n\nIn May, they made the final leg of their journey on foot. They crossed over the Mexico-Arizona border, with hopes of seeking asylum once inside the US.\n\n\"Yes, we did something that we shouldn't have. We crossed illegally,\" Alejandro said. \"But we were fleeing danger.\"\n\nDalia said she and Alejandro had been denied visas to the US. When they arrived at the US border, they had no control of where the smugglers would drop them off. So they were left at an area with no legal port of entry.\n\nThey both said they were expecting to turn themselves in to border patrol, armed with Dalia's documents to make a case for asylum. But shortly after crossing, Dalia said, a border patrol agent had already approached them.\n\nAs expected, the mother and son were taken into custody. What they didn't expect was the trauma of separation.\n\nNo time for a hug goodbye\n\nLike thousands of other migrants , Dalia and Alejandro had no idea they would be split up and sent to detention centers across the country.\n\nUnder the Trump administration's \"zero-tolerance\" policy, any adult caught crossing the border illegally would face federal prosecution -- though they still had the right to seek asylum.\n\nThat meant children were sent to federal shelters nationwide while their parents' immigration claims or criminal cases progressed -- even though the government had no clear plan on how to eventually reunite children with their parents.\n\nAlejandro vividly remembers the day in an Arizona detention center when he was suddenly removed from his mother.\n\n\"I'll never forget that day. It was a Tuesday that they took me out of the prison and they took me on a flight to Miami,\" Alejandro said.\n\nThe separation happened so quickly, he wasn't allowed to hug his mother goodbye.\n\n\"No, they wouldn't allow any physical contact. We couldn't touch,\" Alejandro said. \"I only told her through the window that I loved her very much and that everything would be OK. All I could say was 'goodbye,' and they took me.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Dalia speaks to CNN from inside detention: 'My heart is destroyed' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dalia speaks to CNN from inside detention: 'My heart is destroyed' 00:18\n\n'A nightmare that would never end'\n\nAcross the country, in a children's shelter full of strangers, Alejandro's mind raced with anxiety.\n\n\"My days were just thinking, what was going to happen? What am I doing here?\" he said. \"I was so worried that the frustration wouldn't let me sleep ... I felt like it was a nightmare that would never end.\"\n\nHe said he was treated kindly by staff members, who fed him well, made sure he went to classes, and gave him time to play outside.\n\nBut for a boy accustomed to protecting his mother, \"to know that she was suffering\" from the separation overwhelmed him.\n\n\"I couldn't do anything for my mother, not even defend her,\" he said. \"I fell into a deep depression.\"\n\nIn their two months apart, Alejandro said he was able to speak with his mother by phone about three times.\n\nHe filled his days with classes, games and playing soccer with other detained children.\n\nAlejandro said he tries to calm his anxiety by playing soccer. He hopes to play on a school team in the US.\n\n\"The friends I made, I'd go out and play, (and) they helped me forget a little that I was inside there.\"\n\nOne friend gave him a glimpse into the horrors that other migrant children faced.\n\n\"I had a friend that I was close to, he was fleeing his country because of the mafia,\" Alejandro said.\n\n\"The gang members wanted him to join the gang, and he didn't want to. And he told me that he came home from school and found his mother dead in the bathroom and his sister in her bedroom and there was a note on the table that said, 'This is the consequence for not joining the gang.'\"\n\nAs the weeks passed, Alejandro said he became emotionally numb doing \"the same thing every day -- like we were mannequins doing the same thing every day because we didn't have any feelings.\"\n\nOne morning, as Alejandro brushed his teeth, an adult came and told him to pack his suitcases. Then he heard the words he'd been waiting for: \"Congratulations. You're leaving.\"\n\nHe was put on a plane to Phoenix for his long-awaited reunion with his mother -- this time, at another detention center.\n\n\"I couldn't hug her because the official didn't allow to touch. Physical contact wasn't permitted,\" Alejandro said. \"They took us to another cell, and we were talking there, whispering, because they didn't permit us to speak. And (I) started telling my mom everything.\"\n\nDalia, whose asylum case is pending, was fitted with an ankle monitor and was allowed to leave with her son.\n\nAlejandro's mother Dalia, left, wears an ankle monitor as authorities process her request for asylum.\n\n\"They were going to leave us on a bus stop,\" Dalia said.\n\nBut the nonprofit RAICES -- the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services -- picked them up and paid for their flight to Chicago, where Dalia's sister lives.\n\nThey hoped to find some type of normalcy there. But that kind of calm remains elusive.\n\nThe never-ending trauma\n\nAlejandro and his mom are now in Chicago, free from the threats of violence back home but terrified of what could happen next.\n\nAlejandro, 13, said he fell into a deep depression after his separation and detention. The experience caused \"irreparable damage,\" his mother Dalia said.\n\nDalia's case for staying in the US could face long odds. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has reinterpreted asylum law to make it much more difficult for immigrants fleeing gang and domestic violence to get asylum\n\nBut Alejandro's nightmares aren't about deportation.\n\n\"They are about being far from my mom,\" he said. \"My mom was far, in another place. My mind was so frustrated that sometimes I still think that I'm there. Sometimes I sit in one spot and I start to visualize everything that I lived, everything that happened to me.\"\n\nAlejandro, now at his aunt's home in Chicago, wants to finish school in the US -- \"and when tomorrow comes, be somebody.\"\n\nThe gravity of that trauma can only be understood by the children who endured it.\n\n\"It hurt me so much because (my mom) was the only thing I had. I was completely alone,\" Alejandro said. \"My mom, the person who supported me since I was little ... she's always been by my side. I didn't have any other support -- nothing more than my family and my mom.\"\n\nWhile many kids his age are embarrassed by their moms or want to assert their independence, Alejandro now clings to his mother like a toddler.\n\n\"I wish I could be with my mom 24 hours a day,\" he said. \"I want to have her near me always. ... Sometimes my mom jokes with me, 'You still sleep with me? Aren't you embarrassed?' \"\n\nDalia says she doesn't mind her son curling up next to her, or trailing her everywhere she goes.\n\n\"He says he does not feel safe sleeping alone,\" Dalia said. \"He doesn't want to leave my side because he thinks they're going to separate us again.\"\n\nSo after all this agony, the grueling separation and the lasting trauma, would Dalia make the same decision again to come to the US?\n\n\"Honestly, to protect my life and to have a better life with my son, yes.\"\n\nAlejandro said his dream is to grow up in the US -- \"to live with my mom, go to school, get an education, and when tomorrow comes, be somebody.\"\n\nHe knows making a life in a new country would be difficult, and there will be plenty of critics who don't want him here. But \"everything in life costs something. Nothing is easy. And whatever is easy isn't worth it.\"\n\nAlejandro still grapples with the heartache of missing his grandparents. But he says life back home is just too dangerous.\n\n\"I can't return to my country, even though I want to see my family again,\" he said.\n\n\"I wish I could have put them all in my suitcase and bring them with me. But I couldn't.\"", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 18, "name": "Charlie Rose says accusers are 'exploiting the #MeToo Movement'", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/07/media/charlie-rose-motion-to-dismiss-lawsuit/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-07T00:00:00", "description": "The former CBS anchor filed a motion Friday to dismiss a sexual harassment lawsuit brought against him.", "keywords": ["metoo", "rose", "lawsuit", "exploiting", "sexual", "motion", "movement", "accusers", "women", "plaintiffs", "harassment", "post", "mcneal", "charlie", "washington"], "summary": "Former CBS anchor Charlie Rose filed a motion Friday to dismiss a sexual harassment lawsuit brought against him, claiming the three plaintiffs are \"exploiting the #MeToo Movement.\"\nHarris, McNeal and Wei filed the lawsuit in May, accusing Rose of \"blatant and repeated sexual harassment.\"\nThe suit came on the heels of a bombshell story in the Washington Post, in which 27 women accused Rose of sexual harassment.\nMonths earlier, in November of 2017, the Washington Post published its first story on Rose containing allegations of sexual harassment from eight women.\nIn the motion filed Friday, Rose used tough language in pushing back against the claims from Harris, McNeal and Wei.", "content": "Former CBS anchor Charlie Rose filed a motion Friday to dismiss a sexual harassment lawsuit brought against him, claiming the three plaintiffs are \"exploiting the #MeToo Movement.\"\n\nThe motion asserts that \"none of the three plaintiffs,\" Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei, \"alleges a cognizable claim of gender discrimination harassment or retaliation.\"\n\nHarris, McNeal and Wei filed the lawsuit in May, accusing Rose of \"blatant and repeated sexual harassment.\" The three women claimed that Rose \"repeatedly sexually touched\" them, \"including without limitation caressing and touching their arms, shoulders, waist and back, pulling them close to his body, and kissing them on the cheek.\"\n\nAll three worked at CBS or for Rose, who also had a talk show on PBS.\n\nThe suit came on the heels of a bombshell story in the Washington Post, in which 27 women accused Rose of sexual harassment.

I had sex with him it felt weird.'

Quarterback Matt Flacco didn't see him.\n\nEr, sorry, Matt Ryan. Hard to tell the difference sometimes.\n\nThere are a legion of people who will tell you how great Ryan is. It's almost like a cottage industry. An army of apologists who toss all of Matt Flacco's stats and data and film cut-ups in your face like they're grenades.\n\nOh, my bad, I did it again. Sorry: Matt Ryan.\n\nThe Ryan apologists are everywhere. Ready to pounce. To tell you he's in the same elite tier as Cam Newton and Russell Wilson and Drew Brees. They'll stomp their feet and cross their arms and insist on it.\n\nAnd surely, they will call Ryan and the Falcons' season opener against the Eagles a battle. They'll say they took the defending Super Bowl champions down to the last play of the game before losing 18-12 in a sloppily played game that in the end was fun.\n\nThey'll say Ryan deserves credit for taking the Eagles down to the final moments. Eat that, haters.\n\nBut let me ask a question.\n\nDo you really trust this quarterback? Do you really trust this Falcons team?\n\nTo me, they seem likely the same ol' Falcons, and this seems like the same ol' Flacco.\n\nSorry: Ryan. I said Ryan. R-Y-A-N.\n\nThe game was ugly. It was one of the worst officiated games you will ever see. There were a total of 26 penalties for 236 yards. In addition to being a Thursday night game, which are traditionally bad anyway, it was also the opener, and the rust showed.\n\nYet somehow we watched Nick Foles help will his team to a win. It wasn't pretty. He was just 19-of-34 for 117 yards and an interception. But he kept taking what the defense gave him, even if it meant continually dumping off to Nelson Agholor. He was 3-of-4 for 17 yards on the game-winning drive\u2014nothing special, but exactly what was needed to support the Philadelphia running game, which was wearing down Atlanta's defense. I never felt Foles was going to lose.\n\nThink about that. A career journeyman who had one great stretch last year, and you could just see that somehow, someway, he was going to win.\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nHe has skill, sure, but Foles also has confidence. He has confidence despite knowing that eventually, maybe in just a few weeks, he could be replaced by Carson Wentz. He just doesn't seem to care. Nothing seems to bother him.\n\nThe opposite seems true with Ryan. He has everything around him. He has a good running game\u2014led by Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman\u2014and maybe the second-best receiver in the league in Julio Jones. His line is good, and his defense isn't bad.\n\nAnd on Thursday, he did what he so often does\u2014what those who argue for him so often point out. He won the statistical battle, throwing for 251 yards (on 21-of-43 passing).\n\nBut he also had the opportunity to change the narrative about him and the Falcons, to win, and he lost. It was the last play of the game, at the Eagles' 5-yard line, and they came up short again.\n\nWhat happened in the red zone in this game is a microcosm of what this Falcons team is and why it is almost impossible to trust. Ryan was 1-of-9 with an interception there.\n\nAfter the game, Ryan was asked extensively about the Falcons' red-zone struggles. He patiently answered every question but kept making the same point.\n\n\"It's one game,\" he said. \"That's the sample size that we have right now. It's disappointing that we didn't make them tonight. It's not a season of not scoring touchdowns.\"\n\nIn those short-field and short-yardage plays, the Falcons don't seem capable of winning the intense one-on-one battles. This was the case last season and is again this year.\n\n\"You're not going to get me to say anything bad about Matt Ryan,\" Eagles defensive back Malcolm Jenkins said. \"He's a great player. But we have great players, too.\"\n\n\"No panic on the sideline,\" said Eagles coach Doug Pederson about his team, \"resiliency. The guys hanging together.\"\n\nFor once, just once, it'd be nice to hear Ryan and the Falcons being called resilient.\n\nThe Eagles are a mentally tough and talented football team. They're not a fluke, and they're 10-1 at home, including the playoffs, since start of last season.\n\nAgain, this was Ryan's game to take.\n\nThe best quote from anyone, possibly ever, about Ryan didn't come from either postgame locker room. It came from Hall of Famer Steve Young on ESPN.\n\n\"He's a solid player,\" Young said. \"He doesn't get overwhelmed. I feel like he's ahead of the game. What I want to do is say, 'Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Aaron Rodgers and Matt Ryan.' That's what I want to do. But it just keeps not happening. ... I want Matt to step up and make that last drive.\"\n\n\"Matt's been playing great football for a long time, but there is something about that last bit of getting to Everest,\" Young continued. \"That last base camp all the way to the top that Matt just needs to climb himself.\"\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nThat quote is the truest thing about any player in the league you might hear this whole season.\n\nThe Falcons will be good. They'll put up some numbers and be a threat. Ryan will have his usual backers and apologists.\n\nThe problem nonetheless will remain. We still can't trust Matt Flacco.\n\nDangit.\n\nMike Freeman covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.

Overstock (OSTK) has de-emphasized much of its struggling online retail business to focus on cryptocurrencies.\n\nBioptix, a maker of hormones for farm animals, changed its name to Riot Blockchain (RIOT). The stock surged -- until the company disclosed the SEC was probing it.\n\nBeverage company Long Island Iced Tea morphed into Long Blockchain (LBCC). It's since been delisted by the Nasdaq and now trades as a so-called bulletin board stock at a price below 20 cents a share.\n\nSome companies also began selling digital tokens through initial coin offerings to raise money.\n\nEastman Kodak (KODK)-- yes, the camera and film company -- created its own KodakCoin. There's even a PotCoin for the legal marijuana and cannabis industry.\n\nMany of these initial coin offerings are legitimate. But there have been scams too. The SEC even created a fake ICO called HoweyCoins to show how easy it is for investors to get duped.\n\nAnd several titans of business have blasted bitcoin as well.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a \"fraud\" that was only good for drug dealers and North Korea.\n\nBillionaire investor Saudi Prince Alwaleed, whose Kingdom Holding Company owns stakes in Apple (AAPL), Citigroup (C) and Twitter (TWTR), told CNBC late last year he thought bitcoin was an \"Enron in the making\" that will implode.\n\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) have also warned investors to stay away from bitcoin.\n\nBuffett told CNBC in early May bitcoin was \"probably rat poison squared\" while Munger said at the Berkshire shareholder meeting that the thought of owning cryptocurrencies was \"just dementia.\"\n\nIt's also worth noting that the recent plunge in bitcoin comes at a time when the Turkish lira, Indian rupee and Argentine peso are in freefall mode as the dollar strengthens.\n\nSo investors don't seem to be willing to bet on bitcoin as a replacement for fragile emerging markets currencies.\n\nStill, the pullback in bitcoin comes even as more and more businesses and organizations have embraced blockchain technology, the digital ledger that keeps records of transactions in virtual currencies.\n\nIBM (IBM) is a big proponent of the blockchain. The World Bank has announced plans to launch a blockchain bond. There's even a company that wants to run a fantasy football league using blockchain. (Call me old school. But I'll stick with Yahoo for my league.)\n\nThere is a clear difference between bitcoin and blockchain.

A 5'9\", 175-pound wide receiver capable of squatting more than three times his body weight, he had committed to play at Purdue over Texas, Alabama, Ohio State and dozens of other traditional powers.\n\nAlthough I hadn't made the trip to see Moore\u2014I was there to write a story about a 370-pound eighth-grader who was already receiving scholarship offers\u2014he was impossible to miss.\n\nThe way he seemed to hit full speed in a matter of steps. The way he would seemingly jump out of the gym to catch high throws. Even the most natural catches felt spectacular.\n\nHis legend would grow over the months that followed, thanks to a video that went viral of him squatting 600 pounds.\n\n\"I wasn't surprised, honestly,\" says Chris Vaughn, the owner of that gym in Louisville, Aspirations Fitness, who trained Moore throughout high school and says he regularly watched Moore squat 415 pounds 15 times. \"I thought he could've done more. It looked a little too easy.\"\n\nBut even he might have been surprised by what he saw last Thursday. In his first collegiate game, Moore broke Purdue's single-game all-purpose yards record\u2014a mark that had stood for more than 40 years. And he nearly did so in his first half of college ball.\n\nAlthough he dropped the first pass thrown his way, Moore responded by scoring two touchdowns in the first quarter\u2014a 32-yard touchdown grab and a 76-yard touchdown run, highlighted by a juke that would have made former USC great Reggie Bush proud.\n\nEven his marginal gains felt spectacular: a mix of speed and shake and high-stepping that made it feel like every touch could be a touchdown. Altogether, Moore finished his first game with 109 receiving yards, 79 rushing yards, 125 kick-return yards and two touchdowns.\n\nFor those who watched Moore excel over the past few years, the performance, as spectacular as it was, felt like a matter of time. But even they struggled to convey Moore's potential to college coaches for years because of his size.\n\nAlthough he is listed at 5'9\", it feels generous. And because of that, college coaches didn't flock to recruit the wideout during his high school career.\n\n\"I tried to tell a couple different people I know,\" says Trinity offensive coordinator Andrew Coverdale. \"I have never seen anything like his ability to change directions when he hits the top speed quickly.\n\n\"I tried to tell them they needed to get in on it now, and by and large they didn't listen to me.\"\n\nMoore began his high school career at New Albany High in Indiana before transferring to powerhouse Trinity prior to his junior year.\n\nTransfer rules deemed Moore ineligible for much of his junior season, but when he returned to the field for the team's final four games, he made up for lost time, catching 20 passes for 464 yards and nine touchdowns. His arrival helped Trinity win the Class 6-A state title.\n\nAnd even then there were doubts about a player 247Sports' composite listed as the nation's No. 41 wide receiver in the class of 2018.\n\nIt wasn't until Moore clocked a blazing 4.33 in the 40-yard dash and posted a 42-inch vertical at The Opening, Nike's mega-recruiting summit, that the coaches stampeded to Trinity.\n\nAfter committing and then decommitting from Texas, Moore pledged his commitment to Purdue on national television in January during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. The fact that one of the most coveted playmakers in the country picked a program that had won 16 of its previous 61 games sent a shock wave through the recruiting world.\n\nBut Purdue head coach Jeff Brohm, a former Trinity grad, began recruiting Moore long before many others did. Couple that with a seven-win season, Brohm's knack for creative play-calling and the vicinity to Moore's hometown, and the receiver was sold.\n\n\"This guy has some playmaking ability,\" Brohm says of Moore. \"It's definitely seen by us and all of his teammates.\"\n\nSix months after I stumbled upon the undersized Trinity wideout, and a star is born. Although Moore has played exactly 60 minutes of college football, he left a first impression like few others that have ever played the sport.\n\nAnd because he's capable of playing so many different roles\u2014roles that Purdue needs to fill\u2014defensive coordinators have been put on notice.\n\n\"I mean, there's nothing he can't do,\" Coverdale says. \"It's really remarkable. I don't even know how to describe how liberating it is. He's really only limited by your imagination.\"\n\nNext up? Eastern Michigan on Saturday, which will undoubtedly have a game plan in place to slow him down.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJim Harbaugh and the expectations game\n\nPaul Sancya/Associated Press\n\nWhat's next for Jim Harbaugh?\n\nIn the short term, the answer is most likely Michigan's first victory of 2018. Coming off a season-opening loss to Notre Dame, the Wolverines play Western Michigan in Week 2, and whether their offensive line and play-calling are fixed shouldn't matter for that one. (If it does, we will revisit said topic next week.)\n\nThrough his first 40 games at Michigan, Harbaugh (28-12) has one more win than Brady Hoke (27-13) had as head coach of the Wolverines. On Saturday, it will have been one year since a Michigan wide receiver caught a touchdown pass. Harbaugh makes more money than almost any of his peers, and he has yet to win a conference title or deliver a truly memorable victory.\n\nSo there are reasons to be concerned at the start of his fourth year. Expectations are not being met. But the idea that Harbaugh is even remotely close to the \"hot seat\" is misguided.\n\nThere is a perception and mentality that is growing tiresome with head coaching tenures: You're either getting fired or you're not. There is no go-between. In the instance of Harbaugh, however, it's reasonable to find some sort of middle ground, at least for the time being.\n\nThe program is in far better shape than it was under Hoke. There is talent in place, and it feels like winning is simply a matter of time. Whether this comes at a Nick Saban or Urban Meyer level\u2014a ridiculous bar that Harbaugh is expected to clear, which is perhaps part of the problem\u2014is still to be decided.\n\nBut it seems appropriate to let things play out a while longer, though, yes, that's getting tougher to say as the games go by.\n\nRegardless, Harbaugh isn't going anywhere unless he does on his own accord.\n\n(Unless he loses to Western Michigan this weekend. Then let's talk.)\n\nA wild (sort of) solution to save Kansas football: Hire Lane Kiffin\n\nSue Ogrocki/Associated Press\n\nBear with me for a moment, if you will.\n\nKansas lost to Nicholls State this past weekend\u2014the latest, lowest point for the Jayhawks.\n\nFlorida Atlantic, meanwhile, after winning 10 games in a row to end last year, lost to Oklahoma by roughly 17,456 points.\n\nThings should get better for FAU head coach Lane Kiffin in the weeks and months ahead. The schedule says it will. But for Kansas, something drastic has to be done to right a program that has won 15 games since 2010. (Alabama won 13 last season.)\n\nSo why not bring in someone who can A) score touchdowns B) recruit and C) generate buzz simply by being himself (and tweeting).\n\nKiffin has made no indication he would want this job or would leave FAU, but there is some potential allure here. He could build from the ground up at a school with zero expectations. He could return to a Power Five conference. And if it doesn't work out, he could land on his feet somewhere else. (Saving Kansas football is hard, after all. And Lane Kiffin always lands on his feet.)\n\nWill it happen? Almost certainly not. Call it wishful thinking.\n\nKiffin will likely be able to do better than Kansas, assuming the next few months finish as they should. But after all that Kansas football fans have endured the past decade, they deserve something to hope for.\n\nFive Games to Watch This Weekend\n\nIf this coming weekend's games were a food item, it would not be a dry-aged bone-in ribeye. More like a nice seared chicken breast with quality sides.\n\nThe potential is there, but the chef has to deliver.\n\nThat's where we stand in Week 2, although there are some fascinating, critical matchups. (Also, let us not forget that the weekends lacking dynamite often find ways to self-combust in the best ways possible.)\n\nHere is what you should watch this weekend, in tweet-length form (all times Eastern):\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nNo. 17 USC at No. 10 Stanford (Saturday, 8:30 p.m.): Someone forgot to change Bryce Love's batteries\u2014that can be the only explanation for why the human cheat code ran for 29 yards on 18 carries in Week 1. That will change, although JT Daniels, USC's true frosh QB who should still be in high school, could arrive in a hurry.\n\nNo. 2 Clemson at Texas A&M (Saturday, 7 p.m.): The atmosphere in College Station is going to be delightful. This much we know. We also know that Texas A&M just gave head coach Jimbo Fisher $75 million to win games like these, albeit not this early in his tenure. Even a close game would be a big deal in Aggieland.\n\nNo. 3 Georgia at No. 24 South Carolina (Saturday, 3:30 p.m.): At this moment in time, South Carolina feels severely underrated. That could change this weekend against a popular playoff pick. At the very least, give this one\u2014and South Carolina's touchdown machine receiver, Deebo Samuel\u2014your full attention, just in case it does.\n\nUCLA at No. 6 Oklahoma (Saturday, 1 p.m.): The final score might not be close, but when coaches Lincoln Riley and Chip Kelly come together and try to score touchdowns against one another, there is no way you should miss it. Even if the point spread is greater than four touchdowns. (Gulp.)\n\nNo. 15 Michigan State at Arizona State (Saturday, 10:45 p.m.): Just look at that glorious start time. What are you going to do, sleep? Don't think so. You're going to watch Herm Edwards attempt to rip off a huge out-of-conference win at home. Given the teams and game time, something weird seems destined to happen.\n\nBONUS GAME: Arizona at Houston (Saturday, Noon): The season didn't start how it was supposed to for Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate. But watching all-everything defensive tackle Ed Oliver, who had 13 tackles last week, chase around the most exciting quarterback in the sport is too good to pass up.\n\nWhat else to watch for this weekend\n\nFirst, a new tradition: The Turnover Throne\n\nCelebrating turnovers in creative ways is the latest fad in college football, whether it's a belt or the much-discussed turnover chain in Miami. More and more teams are catching on.\n\nBut Boise State now has a stranglehold on the genre. Behold the turnover throne.\n\nInterested? The Broncos are a massive favorite against Connecticut this week, so you shouldn't have to wait long to see it.\n\nSecond, a new formation: Whatever the hell this is, from Mike Leach\n\nBless you, Mike Leach, for bringing something that would be banned from most turkey bowls to an actual football game. Against Wyoming in Week 1, Leach uncorked a bizarre formation that included an offset offensive line and a diagonal snap from a wide receiver.\n\nLeach says he calls this \"Big Gulp Left\" and that he came up with the idea while working with an engineer from Microsoft. Of course he did. Washington State kicks off at 11 p.m. Eastern this weekend against San Jose State, as if you needed any other motivation to tune in.\n\nGambling locks of the week\n\nLast Week: 2-3 (Ugh.)\n\nSeason to date: 2-3 (Ugh Part 2.)\n\nNot the start I was hoping for, obviously, but college football picks against the spread have no memories. I would tell you that these are for entertainment purposes only, but that doesn't sound like much fun.\n\nWe'll use the Westgate odds, courtesy of OddsShark, and hope we use them well.\n\nSouth Carolina (+10) vs. Georgia: This feels like a game that Georgia will win, but I don't believe it will come easy. South Carolina almost pulls this one off (and covers).\n\nFresno State (+2) @ Minnesota: A fascinating line for a team that just dropped 79 points in its opener. Fresno State is a live road dog here, without question.\n\nMiami (OH) (-1) vs. Cincinnati: This is one of my favorite spreads of the week and the ultimate letdown situation after Cincinnati beat UCLA in Week 1.\n\nArizona State (+6) vs. Michigan State: For as much as we all criticized the hire of Herm Edwards, ASU sure looked functional in Week 1. Sparky covers (and wins outright).\n\nPittsburgh (+8.5) vs. Penn State: An intriguing spot for Penn State after nearly losing in Week 1. The Nittany Lions will win, but it will have to be in thrilling fashion once again.\n\nAdam Kramer covers college football for Bleacher Report.

Choi -- who requested she only be identified by her last name -- was left speechless. No apartments looked into hers and she had been completely unaware of being watched, or even that she could possibly be watched.\n\nShe couldn't sleep that night, consumed by a growing paranoia that someone was still spying on her.\n\n\"I'm scared to be at home right now because that's where it happened,\" she told CNN. \"I was filmed at my own place so I don't want to be here but also I'm scared to leave the apartment even though it's broad daylight.\"\n\nSince 2011, the number of cases of illegal filming in South Korea has leaped from 1,300 a year to more than 6,000 in 2017. Women have been recorded in their homes, had upskirt photos taken on the streets, and been caught on spy cams hidden in toilets and changing rooms. Footage has been shared widely online, uploaded to streaming sites and shared on voyeur forums.\n\nIn the past four months, tens of thousands of women have joined protests in central Seoul under the slogan \"My Life is Not Your Porn.\" Wearing masks and displaying banners demanding the government to take action to protect them and prosecute men caught filming, the anger and frustration among the protesters was palpable, compounded by the long delay in seeing even slight official action.\n\nOn Monday, a special squad of women inspectors began daily checks of 20,000 public toilets in Seoul, with plans for tens of thousands of private toilets to also be scoured for spy cams. Some districts have dubbed the teams \"safety sheriffs,\" kitting them out with broad-brimmed cowboy hats.\n\nBut while this approach has received widespread press coverage and promotion by the local authorities, activists and victims say it's not enough, and they still face a lack of interest and understanding from police and some lawmakers. They also point to similar programs that have been in place in the capital since 2016 but have not produced any tangible results or found any spy cams, with some activists accusing the entire project of just being security theater.\n\nWomen's safety sheriffs inspect a toilet in Seocho, a district of Seoul. The South Korean capital recently announced plans to conduct daily patrols of restrooms for hidden cameras.\n\nStopping the spread\n\nIn Seoul's swanky business district of Gangnam, Lee Ji-soo sits at her computer all day scrubbing the internet of photos and videos published without the subject's permission.\n\nHers is a new profession created by the rising frequency and public awareness of illegal filming: the \"digital undertaker.\"\n\nOnce she is alerted to a piece of content -- such as spy cam footage, upskirt videos, or sex tapes leaked by ex-partners (also known as revenge porn) -- Lee and her team use proprietary software to search for all copies of it online. They then send a letter, or a legal notice if necessary, to website administrators requesting it be taken down.\n\nLee Ji-soo works as a \"digital undertaker,\" helping victims remove illegal photos and videos from the internet.\n\nWhile most websites are willing to remove illegal videos or those shared without permission, Lee said there is a \"golden window\" of about 10 days after a video is uploaded during which it can be easily scrubbed from the internet. After that it gets more and more difficult, as copies spread to other websites and servers outside Korea.\n\nHow fast such videos spread is especially problematic for victims of hidden camera pornography, most of whom are completely unaware they have been recorded and may not become so until months or even years after the video is first uploaded. The speed of transmission is increased by forums and websites dedicated to sharing illegal upskirt videos and revenge porn, many of which have proven difficult to stamp out.\n\nLee said her company had seen a spike in searches for \"digital undertakers\" and requests for help as the issue has received more attention in South Korea.\n\n\"The most common things that the clients are saying -- and they are quite heartbreaking -- are 'I want to die' or 'I cannot leave my house.' Especially the victims of spy cam or illegally taken videos say that when they encounter people on the street, they feel like they would be recognized,\" she said.\n\nThousands of women protest against illegal filming on August 4, 2018 in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nAsked how women can defend themselves from being a victim of this type of crime, Lee was quick to point out they are not remotely at fault for appearing in these videos.\n\n\"In a way, these people were just walking on the street when a rock had unexpectedly landed on them,\" she said. \"So I cannot tell these people to change their behavior and I shouldn't either.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the government began offering similar services to Lee's company. The Digital Sex Crimes Victim Support Center provides consultation and removal services, and officials said that within the first 50 days of operation it helped 500 victims remove more than 2,200 videos online. It also provides victims legal support to file criminal charges and takedown notices.\n\nThe government has also said it will provide $4.5 million in funds to local authorities to increase patrols of toilets and changing rooms to search for spy cameras.\n\nA hidden-camera search squad, consisting of student and citizen volunteers, scan a restroom near a public pool in Changwon, South Korea on July 25, 2018.\n\nJustice denied\n\nWhile the authorities have been keen to be seen to take action, spurred by the mass protests in downtown Seoul, Choi said the biggest frustration in her case came from her experience with the police.\n\nUnlike in most instances of illegal filming, the man spying on Choi was actually spotted in the act and the police called. But Choi learned that he was only briefly interrogated and later released without charge. His house was not searched for a full week after the incident, during which time Choi suspected he may have destroyed evidence of other illegal filming.\n\nShe blamed the police for not taking the matter seriously, and said \"if this is how the law works here then the law needs to change.\"\n\nA general view of Seoul at night. Choi was naked at home alone in her apartment when she was filmed through her 22nd floor window.\n\nResponding to a request for comment, police told CNN officers made the decision not to arrest the perpetrator after he willingly accompanied them to the police station and surrendered his camera and memory card. They said the delay in checking his home was due to a wait to process a search warrant.\n\nChoi's suspicions about official attitudes towards illegal filming are supported by the data however. While the current law states that those caught illegally taking or distributing videos can be sentenced to up to five years in prison, only about 5% of convictions result in jail time, and most perpetrators receive fines or suspended sentences, according to a study by the Korean Women Lawyers Association.\n\nThere was outrage in August when, after months of protests by women calling for stricter sentencing of the mostly male perpetrators a woman was jailed for illegally photographing a naked man during a life drawing session.\n\nThis playful poster made by South Korean police for its new online campaign to help curb spycam porn crimes seems to sum up how the police view the widespread crimes causing so much fear & anxiety among women : funny, laughable pranks committed by pink-cheeked man-boys. pic.twitter.com/uAQlyrxMwX \u2014 Hawon Jung (@allyjung) August 9, 2018\n\nPolice also attracted widespread criticism after they released -- and subsequently withdrew -- a public information campaign depicting the perpetrators of illegal filming as mischievous boys and encouraging the public to take selfies with cut-outs of the childishly dressed mascots.\n\nLast week, lawmaker Kim Young-ho of the ruling Democratic Party proposed changes to the law to impose harsher sentences on the illegal filming of sexual acts, including upskirt videos.\n\n\"When an illegal video spreads, it robs a person and ruins their life. Though it's a grave crime, the law and the punishment had not been strict,\" he told CNN.\n\nWhile the bill is expected to pass this year, Kim warned that the law still needs to be tweaked further.\n\n\"If the victim is clothed, there is no legal ground for punishment. So in order to protect the privacy, we proposed the bill that seeks to punish the act of filming without permission even if the subject had been clothed,\" he said.\n\nA protester holds up a sign at a demonstration in central Seoul on August 4. More protests are expected this month.\n\nThe ability to impose stricter punishments does not necessarily mean courts and prosecutors will take advantage of this, however. Beyond the law, Choi said general attitudes within South Korean society need to change, especially among men, many of whom she felt still do not take illegal filming seriously.\n\nFor her, the experience has dramatically changed her outlook and assessment of the country she lives in.\n\n\"You can never feel comfortable in your own body if you're a woman here,\" she said. \"That's how I started feeling. Just because I'm born as a woman, people objectify me. People objectify my body, even when I'm in the most private place.\"", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 36, "name": "Pay 0 Interest Until 2020", "url": "https://www.comparecards.com/guide/pay-0-interest-until-2020?esourceid=6348406&utm_source=cnn&utm_medium=native&grp=pay-0-until-2020&pla=cnn.com&bdst=flat&acqs=prospecting&utm_campaign=newsandbuzz&tar=cnnnewsandbuzz&pos=1&utm_content=9+cards+charging+0+interest+until+2020&adt=none", "timestamp": "", "description": "We recommend these amazing cards charging 0% interest until 2020.", "keywords": ["credit", "2020", "intro", "months", "cards", "pay", "long", "apr", "card", "interest", "offers", "issuer"], "summary": "*Editorial Note: This content is not provided or commissioned by the credit card issuer.\nAny opinions, analyses, reviews or recommendations expressed in this article are those of the author\u2019s alone, and may not have been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by the credit card issuer.\nThis site may be compensated through a credit card issuer partnership.\nBanks are now offering incredibly long periods of 0% Intro APR interest.\nOur credit card experts have hand selected the below cards because of their long 0% intro APR interest offers.", "content": "*Editorial Note: This content is not provided or commissioned by the credit card issuer.

Numerous experts have suggested the company's board needs to be taking steps to make sure he doesn't burn out. Several analysts have argued the company needs to hire a chief operating officer to help management the company and bring stability to its day-to-day operations.\n\nThe turnover among top executives should concern investors who wanted more stability at Tesla, said John Wilson, head of research and corporate governance at Cornerstone Capital Group. He called the executive departures another red flag.\n\n\"He's a visionary ... but his job is to be catalyst, the inspiration, not necessarily the person to make it happen day after day after day,\" Wilson said. \"His brilliance can't shine if he doesn't have that bench of executive strength.\"\n\nIn addition to Morton and Toledano, the company has recently lost a number of other top executives, including Doug Field, who left his job as Tesla senior vice president of engineering in July and returned to Apple (AAPL) where he had previously worked.

Doubts quickly surfaced about how coherent Musk's plan really was.\n\nIn the face of pushback from shareholders, he announced on August 24 that he had given up on taking the company private.\n\nLast week, investment firm Cowen & Co. warned that Tesla faces \"mounting obstacles,\" including shareholder lawsuits and scrutiny from regulators.\n\n\"The tweeting fiasco,\" Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote to clients, \"is likely to draw investor scrutiny on whether Elon's behavior, management style, and operational ability are enough to take Tesla to the next level.\"\n\nThe company faces other problems, too.

They become more self-oriented and less likely to see things from others' perspectives.\n\nFor instance, in one experiment participants were asked to draw an \"E\" on their forehead. Those in the high-power group were more likely to draw the \"E\" from their own perspective such that it appeared backwards to anyone looking at them. Those in the low-power group tended to intentionally draw the \"E\" in reverse, so that others seeing them would read it as an \"E.\"\n\nPeople with power may also start to be less empathetic. One experiment found that participants in the high-power group made more errors in judging the emotional expressions of others than those in the low-power group. Another study found those with power are more likely to objectify subordinates in terms of how useful they might be in attaining a goal.\n\nOther research has found that those with power are less likely to feel social constraints on their behavior, or to recall potential obstacles standing between them and their goals. And they tend to be more optimistic about risky decisions.\n\nAny of these changes can be useful on the job, noted Jennifer Lauren Ray, a researcher at the NeuroLeadership Institute, which synthesizes neuroscience findings and helps business leaders solve organizational problems.\n\nAfter all, those who have power are paid to think about the big picture, drive teams to reach ambitious goals and be inspiring along the way. And, of course, being willing to buck convention sometimes can set you apart from the competition.\n\nBut left unchecked, such behaviors and perspectives can make you more prone to being a jerk, frankly. Or worse, they may make you more prone to doing something illegal, unethical or immoral.\n\nThe NeuroLeadership Institute even posits that the cognitive effects of power could help explain incidents of corporate greed and sexual harassment.\n\nHow the effects of power can manifest\n\nPower can accentuate your general tendencies, good or bad, said social psychologist Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia Business School.\n\nSo on the upside, if you were born compassionate, \"the odds are higher you'll be compassionate if you gain power,\" said Galinksy, one of the leading researchers on the effects of power.\n\nA CEO with compassion, for example, might approach the question of layoffs differently than a CEO who is laser-focused on goals and the company's near-term desire to cut costs.\n\nGalinsky recalled one CEO at a company he consulted with during the economic downturn. Rather than laying people off, the CEO opted to furlough workers at reduced pay for three months. That would be easier on the employees, and the CEO figured it also would be better for business, since layoffs could have put the company at a disadvantage when things picked up.\n\nGenerally speaking, whether the effects of power prove positive or negative depend on how they're expressed. For instance, it's reasonable to value someone for their skill set when you're trying to find the right employee for a given project. It's wrong, however, to objectify a subordinate for their sexual attractiveness to satisfy your personal desires.\n\nInterestingly, some studies suggest the more negative influences of power are more likely to be triggered when someone doesn't feel they're being respected, Galinsky noted.\n\nTo the extent pay is perceived as a measure of respect, then the findings of one recent study might be worth noting in this context. Researchers compared CEOs' pay to their peer group average, firm performance and the instances of layoffs at their companies.\n\nThey found that CEOs who are underpaid relative to their peers in a given year are more likely to engage in layoffs the next year than CEOs who are paid more than their peers.\n\nChanges aren't set in stone\n\nHow power affects any given person is not predetermined.\n\n\"It's how you experience the power you get. You could not have a lot of power, but feel very powerful and vice versa,\" Galinsky said.\n\nThe effects, for instance, could be outsized or very minimal when you move from a position of zero power to leading a small team.\n\nAnd ditto for a CEO who is more likely to \"chronically exist in a state of power,\" as Ray puts it.\n\nA lot also will depend on what internal and external checks you have on your power -- ranging from your own sense of humility to a spouse who isn't having it to a trusted advisor or board of directors who gives you honest feedback.", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 42, "name": "World's 10 most popular tourist destinations (and their future rivals)", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/world-most-popular-destinations-2017/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-07T09:12:36+00:00", "description": "Which destinations experienced the biggest growth in 2017?

The contributions to a Roth 401(k) are already taxed, so the money withdrawn is tax free, as long as you've had the Roth account for at least five years.\n\nWhile not everyone has employer-sponsored Roth offerings or even a 401(k), the opportunity to split your retirement savings in a similar way can be done on your own using a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.\n\n\"It does come down to the taxes,\" says Catherine Golladay, senior vice president of Schwab Retirement Plan Services in Richfield, Ohio.\n\nThe problem, especially as a young person, is that no one knows what is going to happen with tax rates or your income between now and your retirement, and those things can make a big difference down the line.\n\nTraditional vs. Roth \u2014 or both?\n\n\"Many young people, as they grow into their career, have the expectation that they will become higher earners and subject to a higher tax-bracket,\" says Golladay.\n\nIn that case it can be advantageous to put money in a Roth when you are younger and your tax bracket is lower.\n\n\"For younger workers, they have a longer time horizon for these contributions to grow tax free,\" says Golladay.\n\nRelated: Should I take out a loan to pay my debts?\n\nThose in their 40, 50 or 60's don't have as much time for that money to grow. Still, if you're thinking about a Roth and you're more than five years away from retirement, Golladay suggests contributing even just a little bit.\n\nYou can withdraw from a Roth as early as 59\u00bd. The only caveat is that five years must pass since your first contribution before you can withdraw the earnings tax free.\n\n\"I've seen people put as little as 1% [of their retirement savings] into the Roth, just to start the five year clock,\" she says. The annual limit for all 401(k) contributions in 2018 is $18,500.\n\nBut if you are scrimping to put aside retirement funds as it is and the tax burden of going all Roth is too great now, splitting your contributions between a traditional and a Roth can be a solid choice.\n\nBenefits of tax diversification\n\nIn addition to shifting the load tax-wise as you pay into your retirement funds, and allowing for flexibility when you're withdrawing, there are other benefits to a traditional/Roth 401(k) split.\n\n\"More sophisticated tax strategies come into play when you have these options,\" says Golladay.\n\nIf you're moving into retirement and up against the mandatory withdrawal age of 70\u00bd, you have some room to maneuver. Sure, you'll have to take required minimum distributions from both kinds of accounts after you turn 70\u00bd, but your Roth 401(k) withdrawals will be tax free.\n\nCloser to retirement, you may want to roll both over to Roth IRAs to avoid required minimum distributions. You don't need to take required minimum distributions on a Roth IRA until after the death of its owner. Or, you could roll the traditional 401(k) into a traditional IRA and the Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA to keep some tax diversification.\n\nRelated: How to save for retirement without a 401(k)\n\n\"In years that an individual has a big expense, to pull the additional amount of money out of the tax-free source \u2014 out of the Roth \u2014 is a huge benefit,\" says Golladay.\n\nThe other thing that she sees people doing is using the two funds to manage their marginal income tax bracket, she says. They may pull some money out of the tax-deferred fund, and anything needed beyond a certain amount they'll pull out of their Roth to avoid moving up to the next income bracket.\n\n\"With a 50/50 you're maximizing the tax diversification strategy,\" says Golladay. \"Even if you don't know what tax bracket you'll be in once you're retired, you have the best of both worlds.\"\n\nHave a money question for Money Moves?

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Former President Barack Obama is coming back to the spotlight. In his second major address in the span of one week \u2014 the first coming with his powerful eulogy to the late Sen. John McCain that warned of the dangers facing democracy \u2014 Obama will launch his midterm campaign tour to help Democrats retake control of the US Congress.\n\nFollowing a speech at the University of Illinois on Friday, he will take off to Irvine, California, where he will speak at an event for seven Democrats running in Republican districts, and then continue on to other regions.\n\nHis reappearance on the public square is an important development at a moment when President Donald Trump's governing style has generated tremendous concern about the stability of our democratic institutions. While it is true that ex-presidents often remain out of the public limelight, these are not ordinary times.\n\nBob Woodward's new book, \"Fear,\" is filled with stories about top advisers doing everything possible to contain their boss. One stunning moment involves Gary Cohn, the former director of the National Economic Council, literally stealing papers off Trump's desk because he was so concerned about what the President might do with the information they held. Woodward also recounts people in Trump's inner circle seriously questioning his intelligence and fitness to serve.\n\nWhether one is concerned about his stability as a leader or the direction of his policies such as immigration, polls are showing that a growing number of Americans are discontented with the way the President is handling his role. In a shocking New York Times op-ed, one anonymous senior official in the administration admits that many fellow officials are \"working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations ... many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office.\"\n\nIf the stories that are coming out of Washington are true, then it is fair to say that we do have a genuine constitutional crisis on our hands: a President who is not fit to serve and who can't be trusted to hold the levers of power.\n\nBut anonymous op-eds and a bureaucratic \"resistance\" won't do anything other than enable President Trump. With congressional Republicans unwilling to serve as a force of institutional restraint, the only real answer would come with a Democratic Congress. Congressional Republicans have been given an opportunity to demonstrate they could prioritize the health of democratic institutions over partisan interests. They have failed that test.\n\nAs the conservative pundit George Will wrote in his Washington Post column, referring to the administration's decision to separate families at the border, \"the policy has given independents and temperate Republicans \u2014 these are probably expanding and contracting cohorts, respectively \u2014 fresh if redundant evidence for the principle by which they should vote. The principle: The congressional Republican caucuses must be substantially reduced.\"\n\nThis is a message that Obama, more than almost any other Democrat, has the capacity to share with the electorate. He did this at McCain's memorial and he can do it repeatedly in the next few months. Although Democrats warn that Obama's re-emergence will energize Republicans to remain steadfast behind Trump, the strength of Republican partisanship does not revolve around the former president. The radicalization of the Republican electorate has been a multidecade process and the extremists in the party find new foils whenever one disappears.\n\nThose Republicans who are willing to come out to vote Republican, despite having Trump in the White House, are already energized. Indeed, this was one of the great lessons of Obama's term in office: No matter how much Democrats lean over to be civil or to achieve political peace with the other party, the radicalization of the GOP has created an electorate that always sees blood red. Although pre-Trump politics of 2010 and 2014 may now seem benign, Obama underestimated the ferocity of the Republicans in the midterm elections during his presidency. Now he and his fellow party members should not make the same mistake again.\n\nThe former president, who remains enormously popular, can avoid speaking about specific policies if he fears that speeches about the Affordable Care Act or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program might shift the agenda away from the most glaring challenge that the nation faces: President Trump himself.\n\nAs a person who held the highest office in the land and handled that role in a manner that earned widespread respect, even from opponents who staunchly disagreed with his ideas, Obama, with his articulate nature, has the gravitas to argue for the fierce urgency of electing a Democratic Congress. Few can forget the emotional power of his address about race relations in Philadelphia during the heat of the 2008 campaign or his powerful farewell address after the tumultuous 2016 election.\n\nNow the nation needs an orator of that potency to make the case that restoring the traditional balance of power might be the most important issue this nation now faces. This needs to motivate every Democrat, and even some Republicans, in addition to fueling a fight for a particular set of policies.\n\nIn addition, speaking to America about creating an institutional check on a runaway president, Obama has the capacity to draw crowds and money to the most important races that will determine the future of the House and Senate. While the Koch brothers have the ability to directly deliver big bucks to loyal Republican candidates, Obama has the ability to draw comparable resources simply through his presence in a particular campaign. It is difficult to think of any Democrat at this moment -- perhaps except for his wife, Michelle -- who can draw the same kind of energy and attention.\n\nLike her husband, Michelle Obama has also joined the effort to bolster Democrats' chances to win elections in November. She has launched a voter registration initiative, which, while nonpartisan in its messaging, will drive young voters who tend to lean left to the polls.\n\nIs there a danger the Obamas' presence will somehow crowd out the most exciting voices in the Democratic Party who are starting to prepare for 2020? The answer is no.\n\nIf the Obamas handle this the right way, they will only create a stronger platform, which might include a Democratic Congress, from which the emerging stars of the party can launch their campaigns. The notion that a party can't walk and chew gum at the same time is a figment of a politically insecure mind. Political parties that are really aiming for big victories bring all their assets to the electoral table.\n\nOne of the most damaging mistakes that Barack Obama made when he was in the White House was to shy away from the electoral battlefield when the future of Congress and state legislatures was at stake. In my book about his presidency, I have recounted the high costs the Democrats paid by 2016 as Republicans essentially ran the table at all levels of government.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn 2018, the stakes are even higher. The former president seems to have a clear-eyed understanding of the dangers the nation faces. By taking to the campaign trail to support Democrats across the country, Obama can play a vital role in helping to rebuild the strength of our democratic institutions.", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 49, "name": "A year for the most progressive and populist Democrats to shine", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/07/opinions/progressive-democrats-shine-pressley-gillum-karine-jean-pierre/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-07T00:00:00", "description": "Ayanna Pressley and a diverse wave of candidates across the country are sending the establishment a message for 2020, says Karine Jean-Pierre.

And the message most likely to be sent by the 2018 races is that 2020 will bring the most progressive, populist Democratic candidates we've ever seen -- and young people and people of color will lead the way.\n\nAyanna Pressley's win this week stunned political insiders, defied all polling and upset the political status quo. Pressley, a black Boston City Council member, took on Mike Capuano, a 10-term incumbent in the Democratic primary for Massachusetts' 7th Congressional District. She has never served in Congress before, and Congress has never seen a black woman represent Massachusetts before.\n\nShe won. And she's not alone. Across the country, 2018 has seen a decisive and diverse wave of victories for progressive, populist candidates.\n\nJust look at Andrew Gillum , who recently clinched the Democratic nomination for Florida's gubernatorial election. He was an underdog who edged out a win not by shying away from progressive populism but by embracing it . He endorsed single-payer health care, raising the minimum wage to $15, common-sense gun laws and raising taxes on corporations to fund education, to name just a few issues. And he won not only because he took progressive stances, but also because he took important steps to reach voters that some candidates often don't bother with. And other gubernatorial candidates such as Georgia's Stacey Abrams and Maryland's Ben Jealous are following the same successful playbook.\n\nGillum's strategy may be specific to 2018, but it's not unique in 2018. Across the country, the candidates running -- and winning -- are following the same formula. While we are weeks away from the 2018 midterm elections, the message for potential 2020 hopefuls is already becoming clear: Run progressive, run unapologetically and run hard. Make use of mobile and social media, invest in organizing and ensure your campaign is investing and mobilizing in the communities who form the base of the Democratic Party -- instead of focusing on wealthy donors and cultivating corporate interests.\n\nJUST WATCHED Primary challenger ousts Massachusetts lawmaker Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Primary challenger ousts Massachusetts lawmaker 02:13\n\nIn New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a Democratic-Socialist Latina organizer from Queens, ousted Joe Crowley, a Democratic incumbent in party leadership. Her bold platform differed more from Crowley's than Pressley's did from Capuano's. She came out in support of \"Medicare for All,\" raising the minimum wage and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But her campaign strategy was even bolder than her platform: She targeted young people and people of color, two groups traditionally left behind by politics, and got them to the polls to put her over the edge.\n\nThough Ocasio-Cortez's progressive win is the most discussed this cycle, such victories are being repeated in primaries and elections across the country.\n\nIn Detroit, Rashida Tlaib , a Palestinian-American, is poised to become one of the first two Muslim women in Congress after winning the Democratic primary in the state's 13th Congressional District; she will run unopposed in November.\n\nIn Minnesota, Ilhan Omar , a remarkably progressive Minnesota state representative, just won her primary to become the Democratic candidate for Minnesota's 5th Congressional District. If she wins, alongside Tlaib, she'll be one of the first two Muslim women in Congress. She'll also be the first Somali-American in Congress.\n\nIn Illinois, there's Chuy Garc\u00eda , a progressive Latino running to represent the state's 4th Congressional District; in Missouri, public defender and Ferguson City Councilman Wesley Bell unseated St. Louis County's seven-time incumbent prosecuting attorney who mishandled the Michael Brown investigation -- and he did it running on a bold criminal justice reform platform; in Tennessee, Tami Sawyer won a progressive campaign to serve as Shelby County commissioner, District 7, and in Pennsylvania, Helen Tai flipped a longtime red state House seat to blue.\n\nTheir races stretch from coast to coast, from urban areas to rural towns, and from national bids to state runs -- but there's more that unites these candidates than separates them. And what's turning out voters and winning elections across the board in 2018 is both strong progressive values and bold progressive candidates who reflect the communities they'll represent.\n\nBecause progressivism isn't just about the policies we support, it's about the people we support, too.\n\nThe candidates winning in 2018 know this. They're running races to get young people and people of color to the polls, which many campaigns have historically under-invested in, while overspending on ads on TV. The candidates winning in 2018 are running races that talk about the policies young people and people of color care about -- such as Medicare for All and abolishing ICE -- instead of running away from them. And for the first time in a long time, young people and people of color have candidates whose values match their own and who value their votes.\n\nDonald Trump was able to make it to the White House in part because he campaigned as an outsider running on anti-establishment \"drain the swamp\" rhetoric. Of course, Trump and Republicans in Congress have done anything but drain the swamp -- instead, they've seemingly done everything they can to put corporate and wealthy interests first, and thanks to them, Washington is swampier than ever.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut there's an irony: One effect of the Trump presidency may ultimately be a drained swamp, not by Trump's hand, but by a fierce, mobilized, energized \"resistance\" movement that turns out to elect a new generation of diverse, inspiring, progressive leaders to office. These new leaders can stand up to the establishment, clean house when it comes to corruption and refocus the government's attention where it belongs: on the well-being of the American people -- all of the American people.", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 50, "name": "The most radical part of Geoffrey Owens' day job", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/opinions/geoffrey-owens-actor-jobs-davis/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "RaVal Davis, an up-and-coming actress, says what's radical about \"The Cosby Show\" actor's story is that people were at all shocked to find out a working actor, even a famous one, had a day job.", "keywords": ["career", "ive", "actor", "day", "job", "geoffrey", "isnt", "corporate", "labor", "cosby", "owens", "host", "radical", "criticism"], "summary": "She is also the host of BET's \"Don't Touch My Hair\" talk show, a topical series that addresses the concerns of black women.\n(CNN) Geoffrey Owens isn't quite a household name, but he has been trending this week for something rather ordinary: a hard day's work.\nIronically, it was this Labor Day weekend when a story, job-shaming Owens -- best known for his role as son-in-law Elvin on \"The Cosby Show\"\u2014went viral.\nAs a woman who, after over a decade, left a corporate career feeling completely unfulfilled, I can tell you first hand a \"good job\" has little to do with how much you make.\nHere I am, the same person, but I've also witnessed former associates treat me differently after my career change.", "content": "RaVal Davis is an entertainment writer, actress and advocate for body positivity.

Among the millions of young adults in universities right now, they are a unique bunch.\n\nKevin O'Brien\n\nThey come to our graduate school to study theology and ministry in preparation for a career serving in the Catholic Church. Some will be ordained as priests. Others will be commissioned for service as lay ministers. They will work together in schools, universities, parishes, retreat centers, hospitals and prisons. Yet they study, pray and serve in a church riddled again by scandal. As we reckon with recent revelations of sexual abuse and abuse of power in the church, I struggle for words to welcome them.\n\nSadly, we've been through this before. But there is something different now. Partly because of the #MeToo movement, we want to do more than punish sexual offenders and establish rigorous prevention programs. We rightly insist on confronting a culture of clericalism and privilege that enables abusive exercise of authority. We seek lasting structural reform, which includes greater transparency and accountability and more meaningful participation of lay people in church governance.\n\nIn my two decades as a Jesuit, I have counseled many people scandalized by past revelations of abuse and frustrated by the insensitivity or arrogance of church leaders and ministers. Prayerfully, thoughtfully and as a matter of conscience, some decided to leave the church lest they lose their faith. Others decided to stay. They wanted to help repair the church from the bottom up.\n\nRight now, there are many Catholics caught between these two alternatives. Distasteful infighting between traditionalists and progressives and scapegoating gay and lesbian Catholics for the crisis alienate even more those stuck in the middle. In this environment, what do I say to a class of talented women and men who desire to serve in a church that has disappointed or hurt them so profoundly?\n\nRead More", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 52, "name": "The cowardice of the 'Sheep Throat' op-ed", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/opinions/the-cowardice-of-sheep-throat-op-ed-kohn/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "We're supposed to think that Sheep Throat and his or her herd are brave for fighting the good fight, despite a craven claim to anonymity in an NYT op-ed -- when in truth this person is promoting conservative policies that roll back rights and protections, while complaining that Trump's style is distasteful and a threat, writes Sally Kohn.", "keywords": ["sheep", "cowardice", "anonymous", "week", "unhinged", "times", "woodward", "president", "york", "throat", "oped", "trump"], "summary": "Sally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book, \"The Opposite of Hate.\"\nThe op-ed reinforced themes about an unhinged President and his White House previewed this week in reports on a forthcoming book by Bob Woodward.\nWoodward first rose to journalistic prominence reporting a story about the unhinged Nixon presidency -- a story fueled in large part by an anonymous source.\nBack in 1974, Woodward and his co-writer, Carl Bernstein, called their informant \"Deep Throat.\"\nAnd so, to come full circle, I'd like to propose we call the Trump official who wrote the anonymous New York Times op-ed \"Sheep Throat.\"", "content": "Sally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book, \"The Opposite of Hate.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nI was raised in a predominantly black suburb outside Washington. Going away to Bucknell University -- a small liberal arts college with a mostly white student body -- was a complete culture shock.\n\nFor the first time, I had to navigate relationships with people of different backgrounds. This was also true for some of my white classmates who before meeting me had never interacted much with people of color. At times, my awareness of all of this made me feel like I didn't fit in.\n\nTo cope, I began to tiptoe in conversations around the potentially sharp and edgy parts of my viewpoints as one of the 15% of the undergraduate student body who were of color. This often meant shrinking or adapting my own perspective, especially when the conversation was about race.\n\nThis approach worked for me for a long time, even after I graduated, until one day I just couldn't do it anymore. Between last year's protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the ongoing criminalization of blackness evidenced by the growing number of #whileblack incidents being reported across the United States, it's clear to see in the most painful terms that inequality in America is alive and well.\n\nAs a journalist, I'm often confronted with the ways race defines how we see and treat one another as human beings. As a black woman, I've come to see speaking up about race in my personal relationships as a moral imperative.\n\nA good friend and I were recently discussing white privilege. On paper, we have a lot in common. We're both millennial women living and working in New York. We're both well-educated and come from big nuclear families.\n\nTypically, in the past, talking about race has been no big deal for us. We'd gone so far as to joke about whose grandparents would make the most racially insensitive comment if either of us came over to the other's house for Sunday dinner.\n\nBut this time, while talking about white privilege, things got weird when in mid-discussion my friend blurted out: \"If I'm white, but I'm not a racist, what role do I play in white supremacy? How can I fix racism if I didn't cause it -- and, should I even have to?\"\n\nI was shocked. Her questions were indeed legitimate, though I'll admit they gave me pause. Probably because I couldn't help but think that lurking somewhere behind her words was the notion that racism wasn't her problem. I knew then I had to stop playing it safe in conversations with my white friends about race.\n\nI told her I hadn't created the problem of race either. I also described how racism in America has had real, negative implications on my life and the lives of people I love.\n\nThen I said that she and every other white person in America who wants to end racism should commit to pursuing equality for the people they love -- even when they don't look like them.\n\nShe replied she was aware that racism existed, and of course she cared about me, but explained that she saw few tangible ways she could make a difference. She added that the guilt of acknowledging and addressing white privilege often felt heavy and confusing.\n\nWhat she said helped me understand what she and other white people may be feeling at a time when so much racialized rhetoric is swirling around in the public consciousness. And it made me realize that in some ways, I could relate.\n\nJUST WATCHED Black women in Alabama finally realize the power of their voice Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Black women in Alabama finally realize the power of their voice 05:43\n\nThe idea of race as an emotional burden is very familiar to me. To quote the novelist and social critic James Baldwin partially, I find myself in a rage (about race) all the time, and that is exhausting. There's a particularly resonant moment in the recently released trailer for Barry Jenkins' upcoming adaptation of Baldwin's \"If Beale Street Could Talk\" when you can hear Baldwin's words in a voiceover: \"There are days ... when you wonder what your role is in this country, and what your future is in it. ...\"\n\nThis same question of what a person's role is when it comes to race is also a huge part of Spike Lee's recent film \"BlackKklansman,\" particularly for the character of Officer Flip Zimmerman (a white Jewish cop) in his relationship with Ron Stallworth, the black detective who asks Zimmerman to go undercover and attend Klan meetings in Stallworth's stead.\n\nQuestioning if it's worth the risk to his own safety to get involved in Stallworth's plan, Zimmerman says: \"For you it's a crusade, for me it's a job.\" Stallworth responds, \"Why haven't you bought into this?\" Zimmerman snaps back, \"Why should I?\"\n\nWhen I was watching the film, this scene immediately took me back to the talk with my friend. Despite Zimmerman's being Jewish -- and thus a potential target of the KKK's extremism along with Stallworth as a black man -- in that moment he somehow didn't feel a sense of conviction to be a part of the solution. When faced with discomfort, his inclination was to retreat.\n\nAm I saying that I expect my friend to help me infiltrate and form a coup against a contemporary extremist group?\n\nIt's an interesting thought, but certainly not.\n\nWhat I am saying is that going forward I expect us to be more honest about race in our relationship. No, talking about it didn't fix \"the problem,\" but obviously retreating wouldn't have, either. Realizing that was huge for both of us. We heard each other's perspectives, even though it was painful, and had a real conversation for once. It mattered to me she wanted to know how she could do more.\n\nSince she asked: I told her I thought she could work harder to check her emotional baggage about white privilege at the door in conversations with people of color. She could be a more understanding listener by being slower to anger and working daily to become a better ally.\n\nI encouraged her to start talking more with other white people about race. Sure, she can talk to me, but I'm black. I'm pretty much thinking about race every day. I suggested she find ways of connecting with others who find white privilege to be a confounding burden. That she talk openly with other white people about how to recognize and dismantle the kinds of white supremacy that don't come dressed obviously in a white hood or a Confederate flag.\n\nAnd then I reminded her: Girl, this shit is tough. Some of the tension broke, and we both laughed.\n\nI told her it'd be OK for us to take a break from talking about race if we had to -- but we could never, ever quit entirely. We could never go back to talking around it as we had before.\n\nYears from now, when (I hope) our kids become friends, I want the two of us to look back on this moment in our friendship with pride -- confident that our necessary dialogue helped make a more honest future possible.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWho knows, as small as that may seem, if everyone in America started doing it, it just might change things for the better.", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 54, "name": "By calling Jeff Sessions a dumb Southerner, Trump has done the impossible", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/opinions/jeff-sessions-dumb-southerners-opinion-bailey-intl/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-05T00:00:00", "description": "President Trump's alleged slur of Jeff Sessions as a \"dumb Southerner\" may accomplish the impossible, says Issac Bailey: uniting white and black Southerners.", "keywords": ["black", "used", "retarded", "sessions", "southerners", "carolina", "calling", "dumb", "jeff", "southerner", "woodward", "white", "impossible", "trump", "south"], "summary": "\"Mentally retarded,\" another term Trump reportedly used to describe Sessions, is also high on the list.\nCalling Southerners some version of dumb is so effective that even Southerners do it to get under each other's skin.\nResidents of South Carolina rejoice by thanking God they aren't Mississippians, who often show up at the bottom of good rankings and the top of bad ones , with South Carolina usually one rung above.\nIt was a way to put black Southerners in their place, to remind them that they would never be as good as white Southerners.\nAnd yet, I suspect, while black and white Southerners will be united in our outrage about the slur, many white Southerners will stick with Trump.", "content": "Issac Bailey was the 2016 James K.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) If, as Bob Woodward alleges and is being reported in early extracts of his tell-all book about the Trump White House, President Trump called his Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an Alabama resident, a \"dumb Southerner,\" he may have finally done something he has long been unable to do: unite black and white Southerners.\n\nWe may not agree politically; actually, we disagree passionately on most issues. We don't see eye-to-eye on the issue of race and Confederate monuments and memorials. Even our views of Jesus and Christianity are diverging and increasingly at odds. But boy are we tired of having to contend with the stereotype that we are slow and unintelligent.\n\nThis side of the n-word, \"dumb Southerner\" is maybe the most impactful epithet you can throw at someone in the South. \"Mentally retarded,\" another term Trump reportedly used to describe Sessions, is also high on the list. Trump has since tweeted a denial of using either term.\n\nCalling Southerners some version of dumb is so effective that even Southerners do it to get under each other's skin.\n\nResidents of South Carolina rejoice by thanking God they aren't Mississippians, who often show up at the bottom of good rankings and the top of bad ones , with South Carolina usually one rung above.\n\nNorth Carolinians are proud to be home to the New South city Charlotte and the Research Triangle that includes high-profile universities, which makes it easier for the state to claim world-class status and deny that this stereotype applies to them, too.\n\nSuch slurs pick at an open scab, that of school districts in the South repeatedly showing up at the bottom of educational lists and too high on lists about heart disease. It is a scab that is reopened every time an A-list Hollywood actor speaks in a distorted, haunting drawl to try to sound genuine when portraying down-on-their-luck, unsophisticated Southern-based characters on the big screen.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lemon on Woodward book: This is really ominous Replay More Videos ...

We are tired of having to remind people that we don't \"talk different\" any more than do Bostonians or Bronx residents, that the pace of the words that flow from our mouths is not indicative of the intellectual activity taking place inside our heads.\n\nThat's why even Trump ally Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, said \"I resent that\" when asked about Trump's use of the epithet.\n\nA version of the slur was used in 2000 by a high-profile South Carolina state senator, Arthur Ravenel, for whom one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in North America is named, because the National Association of Colored People initiated an economic boycott of South Carolina to protest the flying of the Confederate flag at the Statehouse.\n\nRavenel caught heat for referring to the NAACP as the National Association of Retarded People -- then doubled down by apologizing to retarded people. He also later said he had mixed up his words because he was scheduled to meet with the SC Association for Retarded Citizens.\n\nIt was a way to put black Southerners in their place, to remind them that they would never be as good as white Southerners. Trump has turned even that racial divide on its head because he allegedly used the term to refer to a Trump-voting and supporting white evangelical Christian who served in the US Senate , was a captain in the US Army, received a law degree from the University of Alabama and is now the nation's top law enforcement official.\n\nIf Trump thinks that about a white Southerner with such a long list of credentials, there's little reason to believe he doesn't think the same thing about many of the white Southerners who always show up at his rallies to passionately praise and cheer him. What's worse is that the slur comes courtesy of a fast-talking New Yorker who never showed any concern for white Southerners, rich or poor, before he ran for president. And yet, I suspect, while black and white Southerners will be united in our outrage about the slur, many white Southerners will stick with Trump.\n\nJust days after he announced his intentions to run for the presidency, I spent time reminding white members of the Tea Party in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, area that they had more in common with me, a black Southern native, than they did with Trump. Our parents and friends struggled to stay safe doing dangerous work at nearby factories and were struggling to find a new way forward as those factories were closing.

One of President George H.W. Bush's picks, Clarence Thomas, for example, probably wouldn't have been confirmed without his strong popularity ratings.\n\nThe problem for those hoping that Kavanaugh goes down is that popularity isn't the only thing that matters. Miers withdrew mostly because conservatives complained about her qualifications . Bork was voted down by a Democrat-controlled Senate because his conservative record was so extensive.\n\nKavanaugh has neither of those problems. He has been rated as \"well-qualified\" by the American Bar Association. Kavanaugh also will be voted upon by a Senate that is controlled by Republicans.\n\nWhen you combine the makeup of the Senate and Kavanaugh's judicial profile, his current popularity rating is probably not low enough to make any Republicans vote against him. He may even pick up a Democratic vote.\n\nNow, the potentially good news for Democrats is that nominees do tend to see their popularity drop after a confirmation hearing.\n\nBork, for example, initially had a one-point net favorability rating in a Times Mirror poll. That's more than 10 points higher than where his popularity rating ended up in a Los Angeles Times poll before the Senate voted him down.\n\nWhen I previously wrote on Kavanaugh, I noted that a Bork-like popularity might be low enough for Kavanaugh to get voted down. Specifically, it would on average lead to him getting 49 votes in favor compared to 50 votes against.\n\nThat, however, was back when Sen. John McCain was not healthy enough to be in Washington to vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation. In other words, back when Republicans really had only 50 senators to the Democrats' 49.\n\nThis week, Republican Jon Kyl was sworn in to fill McCain's seat. Kyl has a conservative voting record and was Kavanaugh's sherpa (i.e. the experienced Washington insider to guide him through the confirmation process ). There is pretty much no chance that Kyl would vote against Kavanaugh. That brings Kavanaugh to 50 votes on average in a hypothetical scenario in which his popularity matches the worst polling nominee on record by the end of the confirmation process.\n\nI guess it's possible that Kavanaugh could become even more unpopular than Bork was. In this highly partisan environment in which potential justices are far less likely to reveal their stances on matters of judicial importance than they were back when Bork was under consideration, it seems unlikely, however, that Kavanaugh's public numbers would move that much.\n\nIt's also possible that Kyl's connection to Kavanaugh might make him abstain from voting on him. Again though, that seems more like a Democratic fantasy than a potential reality.\n\nThe bottom line is that with 51 Republican senators, he's very likely to land on the Supreme Court.", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 59, "name": "Another Roger Stone associate subpoenaed by Mueller", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/jerome-corsi-roger-stone-mueller-subpoena/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-05T00:00:00", "description": "Jerome Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist with ties to Roger Stone, has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury Friday as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, according to Corsi's attorney.", "keywords": ["subpoenaed", "corsis", "whos", "mueller", "muellers", "associate", "grand", "roger", "york", "jury", "stone", "intelligence", "wikileaks"], "summary": "(CNN) Jerome Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist with ties to Roger Stone, has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury Friday as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, according to Corsi's attorney.\n\"While we believe the focus will be on his communications with Roger Stone, that is an assumption.\"\nCorsi is the latest in a string of Stone associates to be summoned by Mueller's team.\nRandy Credico, a comedian who's another former associate of Stone's, is also slated to appear before the grand jury Friday.\nMeanwhile, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russian intelligence had hacked Democratic targets and used WikiLeaks to spread that material online.", "content": "(CNN) Jerome Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist with ties to Roger Stone, has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury Friday as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, according to Corsi's attorney.\n\n\"We are going to be fully cooperative.

Michael Capuano in the Democratic primary for a seat that has been held by the likes of John F. Kennedy and Tip O'Neill in the past.\n\nPressley ran as an unapologetic liberal, calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump and the abolishing of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was endorsed by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- the only other challenger to beat a Democratic House incumbent so far in 2018 -- and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a rising national star among liberals.\n\nIn short, Pressley's win had all the hallmarks of Ocasio-Cortez's victory over the summer -- a liberal insurgent candidate catches a more moderate, establishment member of Congress off-guard. Except that's not what happened here. At all.\n\nStart with the fact that Capuano is no one's idea of a moderate. According to VoteView ratings , Capuano is the 15th most liberal member of Congress -- and the most liberal member of the not-very-conservative Massachusetts delegation. That makes him more liberal than Nancy Pelosi (32nd) and close to as liberal as Maxine Waters (4th). Compare that to Rep. Joe Crowley, the Democrat that Ocasio-Cortez beat. Crowley was the 78th most liberal member, according to VoteView\n\nSo if Capuano didn't lose because he wasn't liberal enough, why did he lose? Two reasons.\n\n1. Tone\n\nThis primary didn't turn on the incumbent member of Congress voting in ways that were inconsistent with the wants and needs of his district. It was about what kind of liberalism voters in the Boston-area district wanted. Capuano's was a quiet liberalism; he always voted the right way for a district where Hillary Clinton won 83% of the vote in 2016, but he wasn't an activist. He wasn't demanding change. He wasn't storming the barricades. That was the sort of liberalism that Pressley promised. \"This district and these times demand more than just an ally, they demand an advocate and a champion,\" she said in announcing her candidacy . \"Making progress on longstanding challenges requires a different lens and a new approach.\"\n\nIn the wake of Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016, many liberals concluded that while the former secretary of state was with them on issues, she was too tonally moderate -- unwilling to talk about things like single-payer health care, for instance, for fear of alienating voters in the ideological middle. Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and newly minted Florida governor nominee Andrew Gillum are all liberals on the more activist end of the spectrum -- a reflection of what the Democratic Party base wants right now.\n\nOne example that illustrates the tonal difference between Capuano and Pressley: Trump impeachment. Capuano spent much of 2017 urging caution for Democrats who wanted articles of impeachment brought against Trump. \"We have to respect the process,\" the Boston Globe quoted Capuano writing in a May 2017 newsletter . \"It shouldn't be a witch hunt or a political statement.\" While Capuano eventually came around and voted for a measure that would have begun the impeachment process against Trump, he was dogged by the idea he was only doing so out of reaction to Pressley's challenge. Of Trump's impeachment, Pressley said : \"I'd cast that vote, but a vote is not enough. As leaders we have to ask ourselves as we navigate this new and dangerous terrain together -- how do we resist and progress at the same time?\"\n\n2. The Democratic Party's changing face\n\nBoston -- and the Democratic Party -- is in the midst of a massive transformation from a working class, largely white majority into a far more racially and ethnically diverse one. As the Almanac of American Politics notes , Boston was a 95% white city in 1950; it is now 25% black and 19% Hispanic. The Almanac also notes that Boston is now populated by \"young singles in rowhouse apartments, professionals in waterfront apartment towers and African-Americans in old triple-deckers.\"\n\nWhile Pressley bristled at the idea that she was running primarily as a black candidate, the fact that she was a young, African-American woman (Pressley is 44) and Capuano was an older white man (he is 66) was obvious. And rhetorically, Pressley pushed the idea that she was the new face of a new Boston -- not exactly a racial appeal, but one clearly aimed at suggesting that Capuano represented a Democratic Party that no longer exists.\n\n\"This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy,\" Pressley said in the campaign . \"This is a disruptive candidacy, a grassroots coalition. It is broad and diverse and deep. People of every walk of life.\"\n\nPressley's win -- as well as the victory of Ocasio-Cortez, a female Puerto Rican-American candidate -- speak to that more diverse coalition within the party. As Cook Political Report House editor David Wasserman noted in a tweet on Tuesday night\n\n\"The share of House Rs who are white men is 86% and rising.\n\n\"The share of House Dems who are white men is 41% and falling.\"\n\nMake no mistake: The energy of the Democratic Party is on the left. But it's not that simple. Democrats don't just want to nominate liberals. They want to nominate liberals who a) are ready to fight President Trump on literally everything and b) who look more like the new base of the Democratic Party.\n\nThose are the lessons of Ayanna Pressley's win that ambitious 2020 Democrats need to learn.", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 61, "name": "When Moon travels North, will he return with a gift for Trump?", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/moon-kim-korea-summit-intl/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "description": "For the first time since he chose to engage with the world, North Korea's Kim Jong Un has proposed a possible timeline for ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons: by the end of President US Donald Trump's first term in office.", "keywords": ["nuclear", "pyongyang", "gift", "return", "travels", "moon", "korea", "koreas", "denuclearization", "north", "south", "kim", "trump", "korean"], "summary": "Chung was part of a South Korean delegation that crossed the border into North Korea on Wednesday and met with Kim.\nNorth Korea's reluctance to do anything outside of its own timetable and comfort has frustrated negotiators.\n\"If reciprocation is shown for North Korea's preemptive measures that have already been completed, he (Kim) strongly expressed his will that more active measures for North Korea's denuclearization can be taken,\" Chung said.\n\"The North Koreans are locked into a declaration to the end of the war, then end of sanctions, then denuclearization and dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons.\"\nJUST WATCHED New North Korea images spark concern Replay More Videos ...

With more than 2 billion users worldwide, ferreting out bad actors is akin to finding a needle in a haystack, Gleicher told CNN during his first on-camera interview since taking the job in January. But he is determined to find it.\n\nSitting in one of the many buildings on Facebook's vast campus in Menlo Park, California, last week, Gleicher stressed the importance of getting it right.\n\n\"Public debate, open elections are the cornerstone of democracy,\" he told CNN. \"There's nothing more important than this. This is our highest priority and it's certainly my highest priority.\"\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the importance of the job that Facebook has entrusted to Gleicher and his team. The company has faced something of an existential crisis in the two years since Donald Trump won the presidency. The US intelligence community has made it clear that Russia exploited Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms in an elaborate campaign to sow discord in the United States and then attempt to sway the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAfter a few years of prosecuting cyber crimes at the Department of Justice, Gleicher served on President Obama's National Security Council. His previous work as a computer scientist and a lawyer gives him an advantage navigating the technology and political realms and helping those two worlds understand each other.\n\nGleicher said his biggest job at Facebook is bringing the company's security, policy, and legal teams together into a unified front against disinformation. \"There are a lot of different people from different places in the company that need to work together to combat this,\" he told CNN. In 2016, Facebook didn't take an integrated approach to combating disinformation. It's hoping that changing that will make a difference.\n\nLessons from 2016\n\nThe notion that Russian trolls could amass hundreds of thousands of American followers on Facebook, target them with ads, and pay for it all in rubles caught both tech companies like Facebook and even many in the US government unaware.\n\nGleicher has the advantage of having come aboard earlier this year, and therefore doesn't have to answer for the company's previous missteps.\n\nHe appears to have a firm understanding of the societal, political, and cultural implications of everything Facebook does. Despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strong performance during a congressional hearing in April, he has in the past come off unwilling or incapable of understanding the profound impact Facebook has on the world.\n\nIt didn't help that in the days after the 2016 presidential election Zuckerberg dismissed as \"crazy\" any suggestion that disinformation on Facebook could have swayed the election. He has since said he regrets making those comments, and the company has spent much of the past year trying to prove that it understands the problem.\n\nGleicher told CNN that although Facebook has always had a robust data security operation, it had until recently focused on \"traditional threats,\" like hackers stealing users' passwords. The company, he said, was not prepared for Russian manipulation of information on its platform.\n\n\"Information operations is a new kind of threat,\" he said. \"We have said that we weren't quick enough to identify this. We know that others have had a lot of trouble identifying this and identify these new types of threats.\"\n\nAs Gleicher pointed out, Facebook was not alone. The federal government was equally unprepared for the onslaught of bogus accounts and disinformation that plagued Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden once compared the intelligence community's missteps to the intelligence failures that led to the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Although the US government observed Russian disinformation campaigns on social media during the revolution in Ukraine in 2014 -- and even sent teams to that country to help counter them -- it didn't think such disinformation attempts would be effective against the US, Hayden told CNN earlier this year.\n\nPart of the challenge lies in the fact the federal government does not have a single agency responsible for tackling information warfare. Intelligence officials touted their coordinated approach to election security in a White House briefing last month, but it's too early to know how successful that effort has been.\n\nFacebook's move to coordinate its own efforts under Gleicher, though, has led to a few public wins.\n\nBad actors\n\nLate last month, Facebook announced that it had taken down 652 pages, accounts, and groups that it identified as part of a coordinated disinformation campaign that originated in Iran and targeted countries worldwide. It also found news pages connected to Russia.\n\nFacebook said the campaign originating in Iran included 254 Facebook pages and 116 Instagram accounts that together amassed more than 1 million followers. (Facebook owns Instagram.) Those responsible for creating the pages spent more than $12,000 on advertisements between 2012 and 2017, the company said.\n\nThat announcement came about a month after Facebook said that it had dismantled a network of accounts targeting Americans with disinformation and, in some cases, organizing political events in US cities. The company said it suspected those accounts originated in Russia, but could not prove it.\n\nFacebook's newly proactive and transparent approach to rooting out foreign meddling has earned cautious praise from some of the company's critics, including Senator Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Warner said last month he was \"encouraged to see Facebook taking steps to rid their platforms of these bad actors,\" but said much more work remains.\n\nAlthough the miscreants behind the campaign uncovered in July used tactics similar to those the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency employed in 2016, Gleicher told CNN that bad actors' efforts have grown more sophisticated. For example, the trolls used virtual private networks to mask their location and used cell phones that were not linked to a specific country. \"They were taking disciplined steps to make themselves harder to be identified,\" he said.\n\nFacebook and modern activism\n\nBalancing the need to eliminate disinformation with the desire to foster debate and discussion underscores one of the great challenges facing platforms. \"Once [disinformation campaigns are] found, society as a whole is faced with a choice,\" he said. \"How do you distinguish and how do you act on the nefarious, the inauthentic behavior, without also harming legitimate activism?\"\n\nAlthough Facebook's terms and conditions require users to provide their true identity in their profiles, Facebook users cannot see who is behind most of the pages they \"like.\" This anonymity protects activists who may legitimately fear for their safety, and was instrumental in social justice movements like the Arab Spring. But anonymity also allows organizations like the Internet Research Agency to do their work with near impunity.\n\n\"I would say anonymity is an essential component of public debate,\" Gleicher said. \"As we work on combating bad behaviors and bad actors in this way, we're continually thinking about, 'What are the consequences that this could have for advocates?' and 'How do we ensure that we're focused on the harmful actors and that we're not putting barriers in place that prevent advocates from engaging?'\"\n\nGleicher has been grappling with these issues for some time. A decade ago, when he was at Yale, he wrote an academic paper about the debate surrounding anonymous online speech.\n\n2020\n\nThe midterm elections are just two months away -- and 2020 lies beyond. Not everyone is convinced those elections can be safeguarded, and Gleicher would not rule out the possibility that Facebook will dismantle still more foreign disinformation campaigns in the weeks ahead.\n\nBut he remains cautiously hopeful that Facebook's efforts, coupled with similar steps by other platforms, independent researchers, and government agencies could help prevent a repeat of 2016.

The local Air Force base focuses on drone missions, and the University of North Dakota was the first university with an undergraduate drone degree. Keith Lund, president and CEO of Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation, calls the area \"Sili-drone Valley.\" Since 2008 one of his employees has been focused entirely on developing local drone businesses.\n\nRelated: Trump administration selects 10 cities to test drones\n\nDrone delivery remains a rarity in the United States. Regulations generally restrict flying over people, and require operators to keep their aircraft within sight. That makes delivery services impractical in most situations. And automated drones must be monitored by a human, which make the services expensive to operate.\n\nGolf courses make it a bit easier, though. The tend to have wide open spaces, few people, and clear sightlines along the links.\n\nKing's Walk plans to start with a six-week trial run with a single drone making deliveries to a single location.

Palmiscno envisions athletes sitting around after a game, drinking beer, and having food dropped from a drone.\n\nTo prevent being hit by wayward balls, the drone flies at between 200 and 300 feet above the ground.

Last year it bought Whole Foods, and it recently bought online pharmacy Pillpack. Some rumors say Amazon may want to move even further into the media business and buy the Landmark movie theater chain.\n\nAnd Forte thinks there are two other areas of retail that could also help lift the Jeff Bezos-led company to a $2 trillion market cap: gas stations and travel.\n\nGoing after Costco and Priceline?\n\nForte argued in a recent report that Amazon could emulate the model of Costco (COST), which owns and operates gas stations at some of its giant warehouse stores.\n\nHe added that the company could offer discounts on fuel to lure drivers who are also Amazon Prime subscribers.\n\nBut it's not clear how Amazon would enter the gas station business. Many of its Amazon-branded stores are smaller, urban ones that don't lend themselves to having a gas station.\n\nAnother possibility could be opening gas stations at larger, suburban Whole Foods locations.\n\nAs for travel, Amazon actually already attempted to get into that business. But its Amazon Destinations site lasted only a few months in 2015 before being shut down.\n\nForte thinks that Amazon could try again, and offer services ranging from discounts on cruises and rental cars to airline tickets and hotel reservations. He said Amazon could consider a rival to home sharing site Airbnb, as well.\n\nHe's not the only one on Wall Street that thinks Amazon may make another run at the travel business. Morgan Stanley put out a report in March suggesting that Amazon may go after the likes of Priceline owner Booking Holdings (BKNG) and its rival Expedia (EXPE).\n\nForte said Amazon's burgeoning gaming business, led by video site Twitch, could also give a big boost to Amazon.\n\nIn fact, Forte cited the opportunity from eSports as a reason why he raised his near-term price target on Wednesday to $2,450 a share. That's almost 25% higher than the current stock price and would value at Amazon at about $1.2 trillion.\n\nFiring on all cylinders\n\nBut Amazon would have to more than double to get to $2 trillion, which isn't far fetched.\n\nThe stock did just that over the past 12 months, and it's soared nearly 600% in just the past five years.\n\nIf Amazon continues to post impressive earnings growth over the next few years, then $2 trillion may not seem out of the question.\n\nThat's why one money manager who focuses on growth stocks also prefers Amazon over Apple.\n\n\"Amazon continues to fire on all cylinders,\" said Matt Benkendorf, chief investment officer of Vontobel Quality Growth. \"This is unequivocally a franchise that gets stronger as it gets bigger.\"\n\nBenkendorf added that Amazon's big investments on Amazon Web Services and its retail operations are starting to yield sizable profits.

He's made progress, but in an interview with CNNMoney ahead of his one-year anniversary as chief executive, Khosrowshahi said, \"If there's one area that I would have liked to change faster, it is to execute more fully on our cultural transformation as a company internally, across all levels at the company.\"\n\n\"It will never be done,\" he said. \"It's a continuous exercise. If I talk to you next year, I hope to be further along on the exercise than I am right now.\"\n\nIt was one year ago Monday that word leaked that Khosrowshahi was leaving a comfy gig as the head of Expedia to lead what was at the time the most dysfunctional company in tech. Founder and CEO Travis Kalanick had made such a mess of things that the board finally pushed him out four months after harassment and sexism allegations rocked the company.\n\nKhosrowshahi arrived to his first official day of work on September 5 with a daunting to-do list. Uber faced a slew of sexual harassment and gender discrimination allegations. It was embroiled in a messy lawsuit with Waymo. Several executive roles were vacant, its drivers were on the verge of revolt and its losses were widening.\n\nKhosrowshahi told CNNMoney the past year has been such a whirlwind that it feels like he's celebrating his one-month anniversary, not marking the passage of an entire year.\n\n\"It's been filled with good days and bad days,\" he said. \"The good news is that the good days are outnumbering the bad days more recently. But I didn't get into this expecting an easy ride. It's been just as challenging as I expected.\"\n\nArguably the most pressing task Khosrowshahi faced was reshaping the company culture and abolishing Kalanick's anything-goes, growth-at-all-costs ethos. He said Uber has made \"enormous strides\" when it comes to its attitude towards dealing with regulators, for example.\n\nEarly on in his tenure, he revamped the company's cultural norms, ditching attitudes like \"Always Be Hustlin\" and \"Superpumped\" in favor of things like \"Customer Obsessed\" and \"We Do The Right Thing.\"\n\nRelated: Wanna bike instead? Uber is cool with that\n\n\"We haven't made those norms an everyday reality at all levels of the company and while we've seen progress, it's not a job done,\" he said.\n\nUnderscoring that point was the departure in July of Uber's head of human resources, Liane Hornsey, following an internal investigation into how she handled claims of racial discrimination within the company. In her goodbye email to staff, Hornsey didn't address the probe. Uber confirmed an investigation, but would not elaborate on the claims against her.\n\nAnd several employees have raised concerns about Chief Operating Officer Barney Harford for alleged racially insensitive comments. Harford, who worked with Khosrowshahi at Expedia, remains at Uber. In a memo to coworkers shared with CNNMoney in July, Harford described allegations as \"painful\" and said he was \"embarrassed.\" He pledged to work with a coach who could challenge his \"blind spots.\"\n\nSuch things leave some of Uber's critics skeptical of any claims that Khosrowshahi has made enough of an impact. \"We've been very critical of Uber and we maintain that position,\" Brenda Darden Wilkerson, president and CEO of AnitaB.org, previously known as Anita Borg Institute, told CNNMoney.\n\nAnitaB.org puts on the annual Grace Hopper Conference, the largest gathering of women in computing. It also partners with more than 70 companies on recruiting practices, keeping women in tech, and creating an inclusive workforce.\n\nIt first partnered with Uber in 2015 but cut ties with the company during the company's turmoil in 2017 under Kalanick's leadership.\n\nWilkerson credits Khosrowshahi with taking some critical steps, including hiring the company's first diversity and inclusion officer and achieving gender and racial pay equity.\n\nRelated: Uber finally hires a chief financial officer as it preps for IPO\n\nUber re-evaluated employee salaries after bonuses were paid out in March to ensure all employees -- regardless of gender or race -- are paid equally based on their location, job and tenure in the role.\n\nIn April, when Uber released its latest diversity report, Khosrowshahi stressed that the company needed to hone in on hiring or promoting more diverse leadership.\n\nUber has also agreed to a $10 million settlement over harassment and discrimination claims by female and minority engineers earlier this year.\n\nCultural change isn't the only ongoing challenge for Khosrowshahi. He still has to confront safety issues and a growing wave of regulatory battles, as well as continue his effort to diversify Uber's business ahead of an anticipated 2019 IPO.\n\nRegulatory challenges pose a significant threat to the company's growth. London threatened not to renew Uber's license to operate, only to relent when Khosrowshahi made several concessions, including sharing the company's traffic data. More significantly, Khosrowshahi admitted to past mistakes and shortcomings -- something Kalanick wasn't known for.\n\n\"He went almost deferentially down that second route,\" Tony Travers, a government professor at the London School of Economics, told CNNMoney.\n\nKhosrowshahi stressed that the first step to dealing with cities and regulators is \"getting in the room and having a dialogue. We're having a continuing dialogue with really all the cities that we operate with, and the regulators we operate with.\"\n\n\"We want to be seen as a partner that's part of the solution,\" he added.\n\nRelated: Uber will no longer force victims of sexual assault into arbitration\n\nThat didn't work so well in New York. Earlier this month, the city, Uber's largest US market, adopted a temporary cap on the number of new for-hire vehicle licenses as it explores ways of reducing traffic congestion. The legislation could encourage other cities to follow suit as they attempt to rein in ridesharing firms believed to have increased congestion even as they've revolutionized transportation.\n\n\"We don't think the City Council came to the right conclusion but at this point, we're not going to dwell on that,\" said Khosrowshahi.\n\nBradley Tusk, an Uber investor and former regulatory adviser to the company, said Khosrowshahi's conflict avoidance approach \"made the New York loss all but inevitable,\" telling CNNMoney it could be \"sign of political trouble to come.\"\n\n\"They ran a very risk averse, tepid campaign that didn't engender any anger but also had no chance of winning,\" he added, while stating that Khosrowshahi has done a good job of \"generally calming things down.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi stressed that the company will continue working to improve experiences for drivers and riders in New York and to ensure that its service is accessible and available to customers who don't have access to mass transit. Pushing customers to use alternate modes of transportation is also a way of ingratiating the company with cities and regulators: It could help cut down on traffic congestion.\n\nUnder Khosrowshahi, Uber has expanded beyond its core ride-hailing service into other modes of transportation like bikes and scooters.\n\nRelated: Uber now monitors drivers for criminal offenses in real time\n\n\"Uber is not a one-note company. We're a selection of different businesses, with different maturities and growth profiles,\" he said. \"We want to be your everyday use case for getting from point A to point B.\"\n\nUber carved out a \"new modalities\" unit earlier this summer. The department includes the alternative offerings Uber has in store. Uber launched an electric bike option in San Francisco in February, and has since expanded the offering to a handful of other American cities. In April, it acquired electric bike-share startup Jump Bikes. E-scooters are also coming to the Uber app in San Francisco, as well as other cities. It also plans to integrate city bus and subway systems into its app.\n\nUber's new CFO, Nelson Chai, will be tasked with continuing to grow the company's core ridesharing business as well as its \"big bold bets,\" into which scooters and bikes fall. While they may take \"years to mature\" and may suffer losses in the near term, they will bring in \"billions of revenue at maturity,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"The focus and the weight of our efforts is going to be around innovation -- but not innovation for a wonderful prototype but innovation for scale.\"\n\n\"We've got a ton of work ahead of us,\" he added. \"I think we can say that one year later, Uber is on much more solid ground.\"", "clickbait": 1}, {"id": 66, "name": "Paralyzed artist's every brush stroke is controlled by his mouth", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/07/health/turning-points-marcus-thomas-paralyzed-painter/index.html", "timestamp": "2018-09-07T00:00:00", "description": "Painter Marcus Thomas creates artwork using his mouth, after being paralyzed in a skiing accident.", "keywords": ["stroke", "mouth", "future", "wife", "hes", "anne", "paralyzed", "marcus", "controlled", "thomas", "work", "brush", "artists", "painting", "paintbrush"], "summary": "(CNN) Marcus Thomas slowly dips his brush into one of the many droplets of paint laid out in front of his easel.\nThe avid outdoorsman and his future wife, Anne, spent their youth playing sports, bike-riding and skiing together.\nMarcus Thomas while recovering in the hospital after his skiing accident.\nDuring his three-month stay in the ICU, Thomas had to learn to breathe on his own again while he and Anne Thomas adjusted to their new reality.\nAnne Thomas said that painting has become the reason Thomas wakes up every day with a smile.", "content": "(CNN) Marcus Thomas slowly dips his brush into one of the many droplets of paint laid out in front of his easel.

Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the Mediterranean diet? 01:40\n\nFor the study, researchers tracked the health and diets of 5,200 people 65 and older. The adults were enrolled in the study between 2005 and 2010, and they were followed up with until December 31, 2015. Each adult's food intake in the year before enrollment was assessed in a food frequency questionnaire called EPIC\n\nThe researchers measured each adult's adherence to the Mediterranean diet by giving them one point for consuming a food group in the diet, such as fruits and nuts, vegetables, legumes, fish, cereals or a ratio of more monounsaturated than saturated fats, and for moderated alcohol intake. Monounsaturated fat is a healthy fat found in olive oil and other plant foods.\n\nThe researchers found that one-point increase in each person's Mediterranean diet score was associated with a lower risk of death from all causes, as well as specifically from coronary artery disease.\n\nDuring an average of eight years following up with the adults, there were 900 deaths among them, according to the researchers.\n\nThe researchers also reviewed what was known in scientific literature about the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet by performing a meta-analysis on six previously published studies.\n\nIn the meta-analysis as well as the researchers' own new results, they found that each one-point increment in the Mediterranean diet score was associated with a 5% lower risk of death from all causes.\n\n\"The main finding is that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is protective against all-cause mortality and also against some cardiovascular outcomes in a sample of elderly people,\" Bonaccio said.\n\n\"We found that one of the most important food groups is the consumption of monosaturated fats -- the main source is extra virgin olive oil, mainly -- over saturated fat consumption. That means you have to consume more than saturated,\" she said.\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that it was observational and found only an association between eating a Mediterranean diet and longevity, not a causal relationship. Another limitation was that food intake was self-reported.\n\nAdditionally, the meta-analysis included only a small number of studies.\n\nAll in all, Bonaccio said, \"the novelty of the study is that we particularly looked at benefits for older people.\"\n\nBecause the study was conducted only in adults 65 and older, the findings can not be generalized to other age groups.\n\nYet the study confirms previous findings about the health benefits of a Mediterranean diet in older adults, said Mercedes Sotos-Prieto, an assistant professor of food and nutrition sciences at Ohio University and visiting scientist at Harvard T.H.

The people surveyed were between the ages of 16 and 74.\n\nThe investigators claim that such studies are an important part of human sexuality research and in assessing the risk of sexually transmitted infections. But my fellow sex therapists and I aren't so sure. Rather than focusing on one's number of partners, \"We should be talking about what folks want for their future and what they've learned from past relationships,\" sex therapist Gracie Landes said.\n\nI asked Landes and several of my other colleagues to weigh in on the continued fascination that the public -- and media -- seems to have with people's number of sexual partners.\n\nAre men exaggerating or overestimating their number of partners?\n\nThe answer to this question appears to be a resounding \"yes.\" Indeed, it's simple math: \"Given that there are not significantly more women in the population than men, if men are reporting higher numbers and women are reporting lower numbers, many are reporting inflated or deflated numbers due to the tendency to answer questions in a way that they think they're supposed to,\" sex therapist Dulcinea Pitagora explained.\n\nIn fact, statistics released by the dating app Tinder show that men use a broader strategy, indicating their approval of someone's photo by swiping right on 46% of profiles, while women swipe right on only 14%. A study of raw data from Tinder also found that about 80% of female users are all competing for the same 20% of men.\n\n\"This seems to indicate that the number of sex partners would be especially skewed in the male population in favor of the more desirable men and that a majority of men are not having much success,\" sex therapist Michael Aaron said. \"It's possible, then, that surveys such as this one, which find higher overall partners amongst men, may be indicative of men inflating their numbers, perhaps due to underlying shame.\"\n\nWhy would someone inflate or deflate their actual number?\n\nAs Aaron suggests, society's focus on the number of people someone has slept with may lead some to exaggerate -- or decrease -- their actual number out of embarrassment.\n\n\"Women might underreport out of fear of being judged negatively, while men might overreport in order to be looked at more favorably,\" sex therapist Rachel Needle said. \"In other words, men who have a high number are considered studs, while women are often slut-shamed. In addition, women might round down so their partner feels more important and special.\"\n\nSex therapist Barbara Gold agreed. \"I believe this is attributable to shame. It goes back to the gender myths that women aren't supposed to enjoy or expose their sexuality lest they be judged in a negative way, while whatever sexual shame men may carry, social norms not only allow them to be sexual creatures but expect them to be,\" she explained.\n\nShould you ask your partner their 'number' -- or tell them yours?\n\nWhether you choose to talk numbers with your partner is entirely up to you. \"You should do whatever you're comfortable with,\" Gold said. \"You might ask why they want to know and what the number represents to them and then decide if or how you want to respond.\"\n\n\"I find that more men ask this question of their female partners than vice versa,\" sex therapist Deborah Fox noted. \"Although men make some meaning out of the number they receive, it's not really the question they want an answer to. They really want to know how they stack up to the previous partners, but that question requires way more nerve to ask. They want to know, 'Am I the best lover you've ever had?' but they're also unlikely to ask that question.\"\n\nWhat should couples be discussing instead?\n\nRather than fixating on the number of people you or your partner have had sex with, I advise turning the conversation so that you're having an open discussion about your interests.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Instead of discussing a number, you should be talking about what you know you enjoy sexually, what you're curious about and what you might want to explore in terms of sensations, types or scenarios, monogamy/non-monogamy and your top erotic triggers,\" sex therapist Sari Cooper said.\n\nAnd while you should certainly ask about your partner's sexual health -- and get tested -- the number of sexual partners you've both had shouldn't affect the need to practice safe sex.\n\nIt can be tempting to focus on one's number of sexual partners, and studies like this one allow curious folks to compare themselves to others. But the fact is that there's no right or wrong number. What matters most is your relationship with your current partner and how you can both make that as satisfying as possible.", "clickbait": 1}]
